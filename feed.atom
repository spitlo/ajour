        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Almost ten years ago,
I wrote an obscure post about something that would have only made sense 
if you also worked at Google at the time it happened (around 2010).  It 
was a reference to an Xtranormal video that someone created about the 
perils of trying to get your stuff running in production without having 
someone hate on you for "doing it wrong".


When it came out, I took a screenshot of the long-suffering engineer 
(some kind of red panda/fox girl thing) and had a T-shirt made from it.  
I wore it to work a few times to great effect.  It was our own little 
internal joke within the company.


Ready?  
Here it is.


As for everything in the video, it is really close to what the reality 
of production was back in the day.  Things were actually quite a bit 
worse than what it suggests, if you can believe it.  The whole thing 
about "get quota in two cells" misses the fact that it was damn near 
impossible to get the quota you needed across multiple services 
(compute, storage, ...) in the same place at the same time.


So, if you heard stories about software engineers doing shady deals to 
trade quota between teams so they could get all of the stuff in the 
same spot?  Yep, this is where those came from.  That's the kind of 
thing that was happening.  People had to blow time and energy on 
worrying about that kind of thing instead of working on whatever they 
were supposed to be doing.


I'm sure my non-solution probably bit someone later.  Sorry, whoever.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A couple of weeks ago, I read a
post
about how the "sealed system" on Big Sur was hurting people.  I kind of 
skimmed through it and figured it was mostly complaining about the 
size of the download.  For whatever reason, that hadn't been a problem 
for me and my machines, so I kind of wrote it off.


For a good number of years, I've been (foolishly, as it turns out) using 
the included Apache httpd to run small localhost-only stuff on my Mac 
laptop.  In recent times, I found that every upgrade of the OS would 
revert my httpd.conf and it would need to be put back.


Why would it matter if the sshd config got reverted?  Simple: it's 
because the stock Mac sshd install includes password-based auth, and 
that means someone can brute-force their way onto your machine if they 
can connect to …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're riding the bleeding edge of Mac software updates, you might 
have just installed Monterey, or you will soon.  If you're also running 
sshd so you can log in remotely, you should be aware that the typical 
"revert your config" shenanigans have happened, so you are
once again
accepting password authentication, and thus are subject to a brute-force 
attack.


Editing that file would likely get reverted upon the next patch 
(12.0.2?), so that's right out.  You can't go past it with a higher 
number, since as the sshd_config points out, the *first* instance of a 
setting is kept, and subsequent instances of the same setting are 
ignored.



UsePAM no
PasswordAuthentication no



Finally, after you make this change, make sure it actually worked by 
forcing a password/interactive-only login attempt to the machine.  Make 
sure it fails and doesn't ask you for a password.  If you don't know how 
to do this, the
previous post
contains info on that, including a terrible scanner script that belongs 
in the bottom of a cat box.

Enjoy.]]></summary>

Often when I ask a vague or underspecified question, what happens is one of:
the person starts by explaining a bunch of stuff I already know
the person explains some things which I don’t know, but which I don’t think
are relevant to my problem
the person starts giving a relevant explanation, but using terminology that
I don’t understand, so I still end up being confused

        <updated>2021-10-14T03:02:42.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the fun things I used to do at a prior job was to dig through the 
raw data points which were collected from the *many* servers we had.  I 
could just pick an interesting-sounding metric and then would just ask 
the system to show me the top 10 or bottom 10 out of a population of 
thousands or more.


To get my feet wet with the whole "investigations" thing that we'd do, I 
started looking into this one day and chose one of the many temp sensors 
which were being logged by the servers.  I forget exactly which one it 
was, for there were many.  The CPUs logged it, the chassis logged it, 
the power supply logged it, and so on.  There were so many choices.


I went looking for a reason.  What could possibly explain this?  First 
off, it didn't line up with any obvious pattern in the host names.  The 
hosts were named for whichever team owned them, followed by a sequence 
number that was bumped any time a new one was provisioned.  There was no 
signal to be found in that.


There was more, though.  You could also see a "rack position" in this 
data, and now it started getting interesting.  It seems that all of the 
really hot machines had a rack position of something low, like 04 or 05, 
and never anything higher than that.  In fact, when looking at a whole 
rack, it was always the lowest number of all of the positions that were 
being used.  Now this was worth chasing!


It's good that I asked, since they told me something surprising: 
position 04 or 05 or whatever was the *bottom* of the rack.  Yes, 
somehow, the lowest machine in the rack was the hottest!  They found 
this interesting, too, and wound up digging into it.  Given that I was 
far away in a distant office, this was the best way for us to proceed.


The problem was that the bottommost server would have nothing below it

move air efficiently, and it obviously mattered.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know I've already
commented
on a certain site's big outage
twice now,
but I have one more bit of rumor to share, and it apparently invalidates 
what I had heard previously.  That is, it may not have been a matter of 
"show X Y" vs. "clear X Y", but rather some kind of automation that went 
a bit too far.


Then, what if you didn't have to actually type something in to hit the 
button?  Maybe you forgot, or something else happened, and you didn't 
fill it in, so when you did that, it said "okay, cool then" and 
did all of them instead?


Go to tool, don't type in target, hit button, ALL targets affected.


It sounds like another kind of "footgun" (you know, something you can 
use to shoot yourself in the foot) from the world of databases: an 
UPDATE without a WHERE.



UPDATE my_table SET invalid = true WHERE asset_id = 1012;



Imagine what happens when you forget the WHERE.  It's the last thing on 
the line as shown, so you could send off the command early and it would 
totally work.  It would look like this:


And... guess what, without that WHERE, it just set that bit everywhere.  
Everything is marked invalid, and your business might suffer for it.


Final note on the "do all the things" thing: maybe the tool 
actually is supposed to let you do that.  In that case, maybe it would 
be good if it said something like "you are about to drain 123,456 
devices, so type in that exact number to proceed".  You know,
that
kind of thing.  It tends to add enough of a pause to prevent some 
disasters.]]></summary>

about this
before,
but in light of yesterday's fun and games, I figured this one is worth 
another mention.


One way to do this on a Linux box with the usual GNU userspace stuff is 
to feed it to date, like this:


The problem is, there's another command very much like it that will even 
spit out the same output, only it has a nice little side-effect: it 
also sets the clock.  That command is date -s.


Another problem is that you might not have known that -s has that 
effect, and you have been using it because it gives you the output you 
want, and you don't realize what else it can do.


This then touched off a whole bunch of badness which I already talked 
about before.  It messed up other systems, and brought up questions of 
how to defend against it, and all of that other good stuff you'd expect 
to hear after a problem of that sort.

display everything, but instead it 
cleared everything.


show mpls lsp


clear mpls lsp


Hopefully the similarity to 'date -d' vs. 'date -s' is clear.

Small commands can have giant consequences.]]></summary>

interested in learning more about BGP for a long time, so I was reading a
couple of articles.
I got frustrated because none of the articles showed me how I could actually
look up information related to BGP on my computer, so I wrote a tweet asking for tools.
I got a bunch of useful replies as always, so this blog post shows some tools
you can use to look up BGP information. There might be an above average number
of things wrong in this post because I don’t understand BGP that well.
I can’t publish BGP routes
One of the reasons I’ve never learned much about BGP is – as far as I know, I don’t have access to publish BGP routes on the internet.

I was reading Scott O’Hara’s article about using JavaScript to detect high contrast and dark modes, which includes a small, very useful script to do exactly what the title says. The output of that script at first looked like it was a “false positive”. But some further investigation led me to learn something new about the prefers-color-scheme CSS user query.

Scott’s article includes a Codepen to demonstrate the output of the script. The script will check and detect if you currently have high contrast mode or dark mode enabled, and will output the result of the check.

something from about a year ago.  If you follow the latest Linux type

Go grab a Linux box with glibc on it.  Then compile and run this C code:


Then run it and watch what happens.  If you have multiple machines, try 
it on some of them and compare the results.  If the results are 
different, why do you suppose that is?


Neat, right?  It makes me want to go looking for places where people are 
calling these functions with ints that I can control to see if I can 
blow it up.

to see how the sausage is made by someone who did the work already.

This is awesome because it's that many more possibilities.  I had been 
grepping source for "isalnum" to try to find inputs I can control, but 
now I realize that FAR more functions give a way into this.  Have fun!]]></summary>

The power receptacle appeared fine, but once we were ready to leave we found the male connection of our shore power cord had melted. Two out of three prongs were stuck in the receptacle. We've never had issues with our cord before, and for now we assume that the marina shore connection was faulty. Either way, we had to repair the power cord.
We always prefer to repair than to replace, so when we returned to a place with a marine store, we got ourselves replacements connections, both male and female, to replace the two damaged ends.
We thought we'd document the process of fixing a shower power cord. Although, this is only specific to Marinco marine fittings.

But how do you set up a content management system (CMS) to reach your audience now and in the future? I learned the hard way that creating a content model—a definition of content types, attributes, and relationships that let people and systems understand content—with my more familiar design-system thinking would capsize my customer’s omnichannel content strategy. You can avoid that outcome by creating content models that are semantic and that also connect related content.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2008, Mark Changizi, a Sloan-Swartz Fellow in Theoretical Neuroscience at Caltech, noted that the eye can make sense of complex relationships that often mystify the brain. 


Our everyday visual perceptions rely upon unfathomably complex computations carried out by tens of billions of neurons across over half our cortex. In spite of this, it does not “feel” like work to see. Our cognitive powers are, in stark contrast, “slow and painful,” and we have great trouble with embarrassingly simple logic tasks. 

Might it be possible to harness our visual computational powers for other tasks, perhaps for tasks cognition finds difficult? 


In other words, could we trick the eye into performing computation? 

Changizi proposed the Escher Circuit, "a special kind of image that amounts to 'visual software' our 'visual hardware' computes" merely through perception.

Escher Circuits work by creating different states corresponding to how the eye resolves ambiguous images. Its core component, the wire, holds a state of 0 when we perceive it as if we are to the right of it; otherwise, it holds a state of 1.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an older iPhone that used to be my daily driver.  It mostly just 
hangs around for testing random junk.  It's still getting updates, and 
so when Apple offered it iOS 15 today, I installed it.  This gave me a 
chance to turn on their beta "private relay" stuff which seems to be 
a TOR-like system.


What did surprise me is the lack of "stickiness" for these IP addresses.  
Every five seconds or so, it seems to hop to another address in the same 
(IPv6, remember) /64.  If you're not down with v6 conventions yet, this 
means the first four parts like "xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx" stay the same, but 
the last four change completely every time.


I actually don't have any v4-only (aka LEGACY) stuff to try it on, so I 
have no idea what happens on that side of the world.  It probably looks 
about the same, albeit within a much smaller range of possible source IP 
addresses.  It probably resembles a CGNAT type situation.

It'll be fun to see what this breaks, and who howls the loudest.]]></summary>

The lack of amperage meant it wasn't able to supply the entire board.
Just the image from this post was enough to make it click in my head 👍


VOLTAGE is like the pressure that pushes water through the hose. It is measured in volts (V).


CURRENT is like the diameter of the hose. The wider it is, the more water will flow through. It is measured in amps (I or A).


RESISTANCE is like sand in the hose that slows down the water flow. It is measured in ohms (R or Ω).

and I mentioned that I really like debugging using a REPL. He said he’d never
tried it and that it sounded fun, so I thought I’d write a quick post about it.
This debugging method doesn’t work in a lot of languages, but it does work in
Python and Ruby and kiiiiiind of in C (via gdb).
what’s a REPL?
REPL stands for “read eval print loop”. A REPL is a program that:
reads some input from you like print(f"2 + 2 = {2+2}") (read)
evaluates the input (eval)
print out the result (print)
and then goes back to step 1 (loop)
Here’s an example of me using the IPython REPL to run a print statement. (also
it demonstrates f-strings, my favourite Python 3 feature)

The idea is to create a semantic HTML element for the ARIA search role, which represents a landmark region “that contains a collection of items and objects that, as a whole, combine to create a search facility.”
Opinions have been shared in the Twitter thread about whether adding a new HTML element is necessary. Many have argued that it was unnecessary because we can use the ARIA search role and repurpose a form element to create the same semantics. I disagree. And this article is the longer version of my personal opinion on the subject.

The topic of quadratic-time vs linear-time algorithms came up, I thought this
would be fun to write about here because avoiding quadratic-time algorithms
isn’t just important in interviews – it’s sometimes good to know about in real
life too! I’ll explain what a “quadratic-time algorithm is” in a minute :)
here are the 3 things we’ll talk about:
quadratic time functions are WAY WAY WAY slower than linear time functions
sometimes you can make a quadratic algorithm into a linear algorithm by using a hashmap
this is because hashmaps lookups are very fast (instant!)
I’m going to try to keep the math jargon to a minimum and focus on real code
examples and how fast/…]]></summary>

In contrast, the highways and byways of the internet were completely congested with people grasping for human connection, and internet friends became more important than ever.  Since then, there have been countless discussions […]

It’s a wonderful set of talks that happens every GDC in which each speaker is given five minutes to talk about anything they want. I talked about desktop pets, desktop toys, and why that entire concept is such a valuable mode of expression. I actually plan on writing a much longer, and more in-depth post about this (it might end up being a longer talk too), as soon as I have time… It’s a topic that has really grown on me because I think it offers so much...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wrote this a couple of years ago in another context, but it looks like 
it's still just as applicable today, so I decided to bring it out from 
behind the permission curtain.  This originally was only visible to 
coworkers who happened to look at my feed.  Now it isn't.


Code runs on people.  Please keep it simple.


You can throw all kinds of wicked, nasty, complicated, 
Klein-bottle-wannabe tricks into code and the computer will shrug and 
slog on through it.


Nobody will ever have more state about the code than the original author 
at the time of creation.  Everything after that pales in comparison.  If 
it takes an hour to figure out what's going on, well, that's an hour 
that wasn't spent doing something else more useful and interesting.


We get it, you're clever.  But the business doesn't need clever. It 
needs code that is only as complicated as absolutely necessary to get 
the job done.  Anything else is just wasted effort.


If a problem calls for clever, okay, then have at it.  But I bet it 
doesn't.  Most things really don't. Be honest with yourself, and with 
your future coworkers.  It makes for a healthier environment. 


I think this was originally written as an indirect response to some 
"clever-wielding" that had been witnessed on one of my tours of duty in 
some infrastructure team.  It's not clear that it had any positive 
effect, though.  These things are hard to measure after the fact, 
particularly once the "look how high I can pile up the clever" culture 
has infected a team thoroughly and it starts being rewarded.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone! This is the list of all the changes we've done to our projects and apps during the month of August. We'll also be reporting in our on position in the world, and on our future plans.
Summary Of Changes
Nasu, implemented a way to shift multiple tiles at once, and added a snarf buffer to copy/paste data between instances of Nasu.
Niju, completed, and released the project on itch.io.
Orca, implemented snarf buffer to easily bring patches in and out of it (uxn version).
Uxn, massive re-write of the Uxn VM, and CollapseOS now runs on Uxn.
Paradise, started on a Uxn-native version.
noodle, created a mascot, and added a tiny animation toolkit.
    
100r.co, added various hand drawn images to the knowledge base.
News
This month, our little engine was fixed (read about it here) we've been sailing around the Gulf Islands, working from anchor. We also found Iggy's successor, a used fiberglass dinghy that we've named Teapot. We've been rowing it from ship to shore, and it's so, so nice. We stopped by Saltspring Island and got to meet the sailors on BosunBird, a couple who have traveled around the world on a Vancouver27. Their blog was an invaluable resource for us on our travels through Japan. 
We've released a solid version of noodle, our drawing tool. Follow the tutorial on our website, or check out this amazing quick start guide by Polyducks. We also released niju, our little kana-learning game. Niju was a trial to see if we could design, write and assemble a project entirely within the Uxn computer.
Our friends at Compudanzas have released part 3, 4 and 5 of their Introduction to Uxn Programming tutorial.
Pino book club
Help. We still haven't finished The Swarm by Frank Schatzing. It is terrible, but we can't stop.
