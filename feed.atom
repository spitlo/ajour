        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone! This is the list of all the changes we've done to our projects and apps during the month of July. We'll also be reporting in our on position in the world, and on our future plans.
Summary Of Changes
Nasu, implemented the export of .theme files, and theme support.
Left, worked on Uxn-native version, and implemented theme support.
Niju, progressed on animations and started implementing controls.
Grimgrains, added a new recipe: Stovetop Blackberry Cake.
Wiktopher, added a new chapter: Lupin's Logbook.
Uxn, created a proportional font format for Uxn, and improved documention for Varvara.
Orca, implemented theme support

News
This month, Calcifer is being re-built. While we wait for that, we're working on more projects aboard. We added insulation to the v-berth, an attempt to keep Pino warm this winter. We created a new portal called boat projects on our wiki that covers most of the major construction projects we've done to the boat.
Our friends at Compudanzas have started writing an Introduction to Uxn Programming tutorial. We recommend it to anyone interested in programming for the Uxn Computer. No prior understanding of stack-machines, or Assembly, required! The first covers basics, and the latest chapter focuses on learning to draw pixels on the screen.
If you missed Devine's performance at Flash Crash, you can watch it here.
Pino book club
We're reading Mingming & the Art of Minimal Ocean Sailing by Roger Taylor and The Swarm by Frank Schatzing.
Pino's location: 48° 40.768'N, 123° 24.802'W

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The game went live just under a week ago and the feedback has been really nice to see.
There's been a balance of "regular" players and power players, and in those power players is where the game got some more much needed play testing.
The one thing that I had designed into the game was the unlimited undo. The side effect was that, technically, there's infinite ability to make your way through the game so long as you had time and patience - a lot of patience!
The knock on problem with infinite moves is that the score really isn't infinite. In fact, I alluded to that in a previous devlog because the score is a 16bit value, it has a max range.
So with that, this new release adds a penalty to using the undo. I went through a lot of different ideas and tested them out to see how they affected the score. Here's just a few that I tried:

Subtracting 100 points per undo
Halving the score per undo
Subtracting the number of blocks restored
Using the undo depth as a multiplier - as in: if you undo twice, the penalty is greater

These had either drastic effects on the score, which made it pointless, or very subtle effects which rendered the penalty ineffective.
What I settled on was using your progress as the multiplier. So, undo costs 25 points per undo on level 1. On level 2, it costs 50 points, level 3 75 points and so on.
This changes the dynamic of the game in a really interesting way. You start to consider the impact on your decisions against your score: do I continue with undo and risk it, or do I accept the fate of stable score and hope it's good enough for a highscore?
There was also some fixes for the custom themes - around the palette because I require a custom palette for the game's main tiles, but when you add your own custom tiles the game switches to the default Layer 2 palette - so there were fixes around that too. And here's Gaz Mashall's own custom theme in action behind a new user interface change:]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you make a language and are lucky, someone else will write code for it. If you are very lucky, someone else will find uses for it you never intended, or that even challenge the premise of the language.

This is not the same as using the language in an unexpected way. Urban Müller could not have foreseen brainfuck as the bedrock for a Rust-like language or a CPU. But do these projects truly counter brainfuck's premise? I would argue not. Brainfuck appears chaotic but part of its appeal has always been in conquering that chaos, in building efficient algorithms using the language despite the challenge. These projects counter the chaos of brainfuck, but that really is the appeal of brainfuck in the first place, they are simply taking it much further than could have been anticipated. If Müller had wanted brainfuck to be impossible to master, he would have designed the language much differently.

Sometimes, however, a language inspires work that falls very far from the intent of its original designer. Most esolangs, like mainstream programming languages, are open systems and don't dictate how programmers use them. C# offers many features to make structured code easy. But I can also write C# that looks like 80s BASIC wrapped in some standard C# boilerplate:

good examples. I haven’t seen a lot written about how to make examples, so
here’s a little bit about my approach to writing examples!

To see why examples should be realistic, let’s first talk about an unrealistic

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ready for release.
After nearly ten months of tinkering in the evening, the Marbles Squared ZX Spectrum Next port is going live this weekend.
It's not that it actually took 10 months to develop, it's just along the way I learnt and wrote the code grid handling in assembly, and then I wrote an assembly based dot command that handles HTTP requests both getting and posting data to web servers - and this is now part of the official spectrum core code (which will ship in future machines) - so that's a nice bonus.
I'm fairly confident there's no lurking bugs, though I am trying to squash one non blocking issue where the game can't get the high scores from the web (though oddly the game was able to post the high score for the player in question 🤔). Still, I think it's looking pretty snazzy:

All the same, the itch download page is primed and ready for release on Saturday. There's two downloads available: the game and the game with fully documented source code and PDF overview article.
In lieu of the release, I've been looking back at the original version I wrote in the early 2000s and found a web based Palm Pilot emulator that let me actually play and capture screenshots of the original game (I even managed to recover the source code and published it on github). So I present to you - the old version:

Once the game is live for the Spectrum I'll release the web version and if I planned the code right, we'll all be able to contribute to the high score leader board!]]></summary>

To pull a specific file, say the last commit, the following command line does the trick:
git show HEAD^:./myfile.bin > myfile.bin

The HEAD^ means "one commit behind the head of the branch" (the "head" being the last commit on the branch). Though if you've got merge commits where a commit has more than one parent commit this can get a little complicated (which why I tend to stick to just the previous commit).
Using HEAD^^ or HEAD^2 means "two commits before the head of the branch". There's also detailed stackoverflow post about the difference between the caret ^ and the tilde ~ with examples of how they traverse up the tree.]]></summary>

It might seem counterintuitive to start the process of receiving feedback with a question, but that makes sense if we realize that getting feedback can be thought of as a form of design research. In the same way that we wouldn’t do any research without the right questions to get the insights that we need, the best way to ask for feedback is also to craft sharp questions.
Design critique is not a one-shot process. Sure, any good feedback workflow continues until the project is finished, but this is particularly true for design because design wor…]]></summary>

        <updated>2021-06-21T07:39:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zzo38 is undoubtedly the most prolific of esolangers. In addition to his long list of fully developed esolangs are his unimplemented ideas and experiments. He has been creating languages since 1994 with DZZZZ, a Funge-like language not much younger than Befunge. 


» Is there a meaning behind your pseudonym zzo38?

"ZZO" is like "ZZT", which is a DOS-based game engine I have used in the past (and still do). (ZZT wasn't Free software at the time, but it is now.)

The numbers 3 and 8 are from I wanted to decorate a pillow with numbers but those are the only numbers they had.

» Your list on the esolangs wiki of unusual features of languages is fascinating, e.g. how COBOL can change the locations GOTOs point to. Do you draw from these in designing your own languages? What are the most esoteric features you've found in non-esoteric languages? What do you consider the most non-intentionally-esoteric language?

It had been said that PostScript is both esoteric and non-esoteric at the same time. Additionally, I would think PostScript is both general-purpose and domain-specific at the same time, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After baulking at the fuss over light and dark theming in both browsers and systems, I've fully jumped into the bandwagon and enjoy when my system theme switches to "evening" mode and everything goes easier on my eyes - I even blogged about my set up last year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When using postgres locally for development, sometimes, if the production dataset is too large, I'll take a sample to work with locally.
More recently I've run into the problem that when I load new production data into tables with auto increment primary key columns, I'll get a conflict, i.e. I load some production data in locally, and then when the auto increment runs it'll hit a conflict - because my local sequences are completely out of sync with production.
The solution is to update my local sequence value. This is a two part process.
1. Capture current values from production:
SELECT last_value FROM public.<table>_<col>_seq;

So for something like user ids, this would be:
SELECT last_value FROM public.user_id_seq;
>>> 304

If this doesn't yield a result, then the sequence name is wrong, and it can be checked with the following query:
SELECT pg_get_serial_sequence('user', 'id');

Now armed with this value, in my example 304, the next part is to upload locally:
2. Update sequences locally:
