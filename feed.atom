        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I guess I've turned into a collector of numbers that break things 
sometimes.  Here's another one I just heard about, and it's directly 
related to what just happened with the calendar.


The last value for last year is December 31, 2021 at 23:59, and in this 
format it becomes 2112312359.  That just fits into a signed 32 bit 
number (which tops out at 2147483647).


So, if you're using Microsoft Exchange and stopped getting your mail in 
the past couple of hours, this is why!

Really!  No joke!

Happy 2022, everyone.]]></summary>

Favorite TV show of 2021 was Only Murders in the Building.  
Favorite game of 2021 was Loop Heroes. 
Favorite book of 2021 was Einstein's Fridge.
Favorite rediscovered joy of 2021 was reading physical books.
Favorite movie of 2021 was Dune.
Favorite time waster of 2021 was watching physics videos on YouTube.
Least favorite movie of 2021 was anything with f**king superheroes.
Favorite pandemic of 2021 was Covid-19 (three years running).
See you in an exciting 2022 where everyone will be nice and respectful and personal agendas are put aside for the greater good and we all come together and save the planet. 
Either that or a horrific dystopian post-apocalyptic world where we hunt each other for food.
2022 could go either way.]]></summary>

on wizard zines.

I think the two hardest things about working for myself are working alone and
having to decide what to do.
This year I spent some time trying to figure out what I’m doing with wizard
zines. This is hard for me because I work in a pretty intuitive way – I have
some feelings about what’s important, and even though following my feelings
usually turns out well, I can’t always explain what I’m trying to do.

Rek was so excited about the mushroom that they decided to draw some this month, this series focuses on varieties that grow on Vancouver Island.
In other news, we had an interview with the founder of Sourcehut, read it here. Also, our good friend Alderwick make us a very cool gift(YouTube).

Playing a game these days feels like as much of a financial investment as it becomes a life investment. I find myself drawn more and more to spelunking itch.io for tiny hidden gems… getting lost while diving into all the developer pages filled with all these odd little works.

looking for a matching feature, and it turned into a security dumpster 
fire.  Here's what happened.


When you're in that situation, you can't just mkdir() the final path.  
It won't work.  You have to start from the top and work your way down.  
The ones which already exist will probably fail with -EEXIST, so 
sometimes it makes more sense to look at what's there, work your way

Clayton and I did this back in Dec of 2004.  Interesting how much hasn't changed. I'd have more "male" spouses now, something about loot crates and IAP, kissing up to steamers, and maybe change the last verse to be more "indie", but its shockingly accurate years later.
The Twelve Days of Crunch Time
A poem by Gilbert and Kauzlaric
On the twelfth day of crunch time,
My project gave to me...

Twelve cents in royalties,

Eleven kiss-ass previews,

Ten nerdy testers,

Nine patent lawsuits,

Eight unplanned for features,

Seven frames a second,

Six angry spouses,

Five focus groups!

Four unstable hacks,

Three days without sleep,

Two surly artists,

and a crappy publishing deal.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It took a while, but I finally managed to create my own Game Boy cartridge. With WiFi! At this point, it can only demo a simple telnet-style communication and access Wikipedia articles, but I am confident that I will showcase more in the future. For now, the interesting and surprisingly tricky part is how the thing works at all. Click the image to see the video on youtube.com. If you just want to see the cartridge in action or want to get into all the details, I highly recommend to watch the video first as it goes through the difficulties and their respective solutions. In contrast, this article here is less visual in its explanations and mostly documents the device in detail, so unless you are already familiar with the parallel memory interface of the Game Boy, you might want to start with the overview from the video.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I’ve been thinking about how to explain DNS a bunch in the last year.
I like to learn in a very hands-on way. And so when I write a zine, I often
close the zine by saying something like “… and the best way to learn more
about this is to play around and experiment!“.
So I built a site where you can do experiments with DNS called Mess With DNS. It has examples of experiments you can try, and
you’ve very encouraged to come up with your own experiments.
In this post I’ll talk about why I made this, how it works, and give you
probably more details than you want to know about how I built it (design, testing,
security, writing an authoritative nameserver, live streaming updates, etc)

Here’s a GIF screencast of what it looks like to use it:

When I first started using dig I found it a bit intimidating – there are so
many options! I’m going to leave out most of dig’s options in this post and just
talk about the ones I actually use.
Also I learned recently that you can set up a .digrc configuration file to make its output
easier to read and it makes it SO MUCH nicer to use.
I also drew a zine page about dig a few years ago, but I wanted to write this post to include a bit more information.

that builds nothing and instead rents everything from some vendor.  
Given that, it's only fair that I describe something bad that can 
happen at a company which is known for building stuff.


The trouble is that sometimes these companies will hire someone who's 
known for doing X... and *only* X.  They're a builder, all right, as 
long as you want them to build X.  Perhaps they have been building X at 
some other company, and now your company has hired them to come and do 
that same job over here instead.


There's also the possibility that the prestige of having this person 
working at the company is what they're actually cultivating, and 
management wants to make this person happy by letting them work on their 
pet project, even if the pet project itself is not doing anything 
positive.

actually belongs in 
production.  In one outcome, it's brilliantly executed and things grow.  
But, this is about the downsides, and in that scenario, it's a stinking 
pile of garbage and needs to be thrown out, but it gets forced in, 
anyway.


If this project is being pushed for political reasons, then it should 
not come as a surprise that when it finally does ship to production,
it causes outages and generally fails to deliver on its promises.  It's 
actually worse than just leaving things the way they had been before any 
of this stuff showed up.


Just imagine what companies would look like if their hiring processes 
filtered out this kind of charlatan instead of looking for whether they 
could do some dumb coding card trick in a 45 minute interview block.
I think they'd look very different, and a whole bunch of people would 
have to find another industry to prey upon.]]></summary>

At 368 pages it’s a thin book compared to earlier volumes. When we started the book series, the challenge was to unlock an archive of almost 12 years. It made sense to pack this content into as few volumes as possible. However, looking ahead, we will publish more often, once every one to three years, depending on the number of articles written.

We are growing Lion's Mane mushrooms currently (a first for us), and we are continuing to lacto-ferment vegetables like kohlrabi, turnips, daikon, cauliflower and red onion. To learn how to do it, see our guide to lactofermentation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A wonderful journey into Rothfuss' world.
As part two of a three part series covering three days (one book per day), the tone and story continues brilliantly onwards from book one (which I read mid-2019).
The characters, their quirks and more importantly to me, the beautiful prose of the book came right back to life.
The book clocks in at a 1,000 pages, and though by my standard that's a (very) long book, quite often I found myself happy that I was still inside the tale and that I still had a long way to go before it would end (and I knew that the current decade wait for book three could well draw longer so I wasn't so eager to finish the book!).
For me, the enjoyment was in the storytelling and being whisked away into the world completely. I honestly did find the amount of sex in the book kind of over the top. I can buy that Kvothe is a legend character and one part of that is perhaps he has a reputation with women, but I'm not wholely sure I needed the many-month-long shagathon story when Kvothe is away with the faeries…
Still, even with this, I found myself wanting to stay in the world for as long as I could.
The very ending, like the last few pages of The Name of the Wind did surprise me a left me a little confused, but I like to think that one day The Doors of Stone will answer some of those questions…]]></summary>

Whilst I'm here in the real world, my blog will exist in the digital world, and every single post URL will work (404s are for the weak! 😏).
Back in 2015 I set myself an goal to publish at least two posts a month, for the most part I've managed. I've always been a fan of "easy goals" - something that's achievable without it causing stress - so doing some writing twice a month definitely hit that sweet spot.
This particular blog has been active since 2006, but I had also toyed with more diary-like sites during the early-2000s but the URLs are so obscure not only has the web forgotten, but they're wiped clean from my own memory.

The underlying message of this scare-talk is that we've been too generous with "essential workers," by allowing them to inch a little closer to a living wage, and now it's time to roll that back, for their own good.

This has been working mostly ok for me, but sometimes I run into problems. So I

How to make your own game engine (and why) by Tyler Glaiel
Well worth a read.
In my 35+ year career in games I've never used an off the shelf game engine.  Starting with SCUMM I've always build my own.  I love the power and the freedom.  It's hard work and probably cost me more but I love making game engines and writing compilers.  It's a skill you slowly acquire and after the 5th one it's not a daunting task anymore.
I ran into a programmer at an indie meet-up and she told me this story about how another programmer at her company brought up building their own game engine.  Someone responded with "What! Are you Ron Gilbert!"
I wear that as a badge of honor.  😀]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think this might be one of the first balanced or non-invested reads of what "Web3" means and Sloan's opening notes really resonate:

It’s for kids. I mean that in a good way! I think Web3 has resonated powerfully with young people because it feels like something genuinely new, and it feels like it can be theirs. Who could argue with those feelings? Not me.

The notes go on and I come away with the same general sense that I've had so far of the crowd cheering on for Web3: it's about making money. Which is fine, the world runs on capitalism for the most part, it's just not entirely for me.
And I think that's the rub, the stories I know of the creation and the spread of the web (and indeed the internet) came from those wanting to share and do good. The stories I've read were never about making money but instead creating a place for others.
I will concede that I don't tend to read the "got rich by selling X web start up" - but it's that start in the web that's what drives me, and what I love about the web. It's what I love about the Open Web.
Web Zero if you will. It was about sharing, community, learning and finding a place in the world.

Star Trek used be be about hope.  Even in the dark days of the 1960's cold war you could see hope for our future in Star Trek. They mange to comment on our then messed up world while being optimistic about the future. It's a lesson current Star Trek could learn from.
Next Generation followed in that tradition. There was conflict but also hope in what the future could be.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In writing about my dumb little "mailserv" project this past weekend, I 
purposely avoided mentioning some of the parameters lest they distract 
from the message I was trying to convey.  My attempted message was 
something along the lines of "everyone starts somewhere, ignorance is 
the default state until changed, and look at some of the shit I have 
inflicted upon the world as proof".


In the case of the mailserv project, that is, the thing that did what 
we'd call "greylisting" today, it ran on an auxiliary box that itself 
only existed because of yet another terrible hack involving a second T1 
and the systemic inability to run BGP properly.  I've talked about the 
finer points of that before, and it's not really on topic here.  But, 
keep in mind that it meant from 1997 forward, I had a machine running 
Squid just so we could push some web traffic out this secondary 
(fractional) T1 to take the load off the main circuit.


It was relatively cheap shit, and it had no special "server" features.





That's a Pentium 150 with 128 megabytes of memory, a (PATA!) IDE hard 
drive with just 1.6 GB of space, a 10 Mbps Ethernet card, plus a video 
card, CD-ROM drive and Sound Blaster that meant nothing, because it was 
a server.  (The SB16, incidentally, proves this was intended to be a 
classroom box running Kid Pix for some elementary school students.)


All of this in 128 MB of memory and a gig and a half of disk space.


Instrumenting things to find slow points and trying to do something 
about it made for a bunch of little changes over the year or two that 
this spam filtering service existed.  Everything was driven by actual 
needs and a distinct lack of system resources.  It kept up with the load 
and stopped a great many things that otherwise would have annoyed my 
users.

This is just an example of what we did with what was available then.]]></summary>

post
late on a Saturday night.  For some reason, it tends to bring out 
THE ONE
more than any other time of the week.  I wonder why that is.


I mean, you're not wrong... but how's the rest of that quote go?


Recall that it turned into a situation where the individual components 
of the query (ip, helo, from, to) were now in their own tables, so they 
all had a number now - the "id" column.  I figured, okay, I need to 
obtain those little suckers before I can build a query with them, so 
let's query!


So, yep, I fired off four queries to get four numbers, then built up a 
query, then fired that off as a fifth to get my results.


Did I mention that I obviously didn't know the first thing about JOIN 
back then?  It took several more years for that to happen organically.

Go on, bag on me for being ignorant.  I know what that really means.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first time you encounter something, you're probably going to make 
some mistakes.  There's a post going around tonight about how someone 
forgot to put an index on some database thing and wound up doing full 
table scans (or something like that).  The rub is that instead of just 
being slow, it also cost a fair amount of money because this crazy 
vendor system charged by the row or somesuch.  So, by scanning 
the whole table, they touched all of those rows, and oh hey, massive 
amounts of money just set ablaze!


This system was something that was intended to slow down or stop a lot 
of the "open proxy" spam that was going around at the time - late 2002.  
It was apparent that these spammer scum would grab an open proxy and 
then would connect outward to your mail exchanger and would t…]]></summary>

        <id>https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2021/11/05/sevenbits/</id>
        <link href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2021/11/05/sevenbits/"/>
        <updated>2021-11-05T07:13:18.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last November, I put up a
list
of a bunch of "magic numbers" including some years in which time/date 
stuff is likely to break.  There's 2036 for the NTP era rollover, 2038 
for time_t requiring 32 bits in January *and* another GPS week rollover 
in November.


Looking at the current year gives you a hint.  It's 2021, but another 
way of looking at that is that we're 121 years past the year 1900.  A 
fair number of things use(d) 1900 as an epoch, base year, or just an 
offset of sorts.  Why?  Well, they were probably invented in simpler 
times when the current year wasn't quite that far from 1900 at the time, 
and it would fit into fewer bits.  Specifically, it'll fit into just 
seven bits... until 2028, that is.


So, if someone used 1900 as their base year, stored years relative to 
that, and then did it in just seven bits (or eight bits where one of 
them is a sign bit), it'll overflow in a little over six years.  What 
happens then depends on which method was used, and whether it applies 
certain kinds of sanity checks.

1773.  Neat!


I originally spotted this thanks to a 
bug report type comment
on an epitaph (!) on HN.  That one is about ISO 9660 (CD/DVD stuff) 
software and how it handles years.

similar
was found in the Linux kernel in 2015 (and appears to have been 
patched).

reference to this same problem
that might be useful if you're trying to keep your HP 3000 alive.  You 
know, the things with the 
300+ lb disk drives?  
(If you know, you know.)


Wikipedia does have 2028 in their epic
list
of time formatting and storage bugs, naturally, but it only talks about 
systems from the '70s.  It doesn't mention ISO 9660 at all - at the 
moment, that is.  Perhaps someone in the know will update it and then 
this comment will be obsolete.


...


Eleven bits!  Luxury!  Ah, well, guess what happens in 2048?  Yep!


Finally, one random thing for anyone who's not already aware: try
log2(n) to get a feel for how big a number is in binary.  Neat, right?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was looking into problems people were having with DNS a few months ago and I
noticed one common theme – a lot of people have server issues (“my server is
down! or it’s slow!“), but they can’t tell if the problem is caused by DNS or
not.
So here are a few tools I use to tell if a problem I’m having is caused by DNS,
as well as a few DNS debuggging stories from my life.
I don’t try to interpret browser error messages
First, let’s talk briefly about browser error messages. You might think that
your browser will tell you if the problem is DNS or not! And it could but
mine doesn’t seem to do so in any obvious way.
On my machine, if Firefox fails to resolve DNS for a site, it gives me the
error: Hmm. We’re having trouble finding that site. We can’t connect to the
server at bananas.wizardzines.…]]></summary>
