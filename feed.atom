and I want to talk about it a little more. This came up because I was showing a

happening in the demo didn’t line up with his mental model of how DNS worked.
He immediately brought this up and adjusted his mental model (“oh, DNS records are

how to use dig to make DNS queries, so here’s a quick blog post about it.
When I first started using dig I found it a bit intimidating – there are so
many options! I’m going to leave out most of dig’s options in this post and just
talk about the ones I actually use.
Also I learned recently that you can set up a .digrc configuration file to make its output
easier to read and it makes it SO MUCH nicer to use.
I also drew a zine page about dig a few years ago, but I wanted to write this post to include a bit more information.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've told some stories about what happens when you end up at a company 
that builds nothing and instead rents everything from some vendor.  
Given that, it's only fair that I describe something bad that can 
happen at a company which is known for building stuff.


The trouble is that sometimes these companies will hire someone who's 
known for doing X... and *only* X.  They're a builder, all right, as 
long as you want them to build X.  Perhaps they have been building X at 
some other company, and now your company has hired them to come and do 
that same job over here instead.


There's also the possibility that the prestige of having this person 
working at the company is what they're actually cultivating, and 
management wants to make this person happy by letting them work on their 
pet project, even if the pet project itself is not doing anything 
positive.

actually belongs in 
production.  In one outcome, it's brilliantly executed and things grow.  
But, this is about the downsides, and in that scenario, it's a stinking 
pile of garbage and needs to be thrown out, but it gets forced in, 
anyway.


If this project is being pushed for political reasons, then it should 
not come as a surprise that when it finally does ship to production,
it causes outages and generally fails to deliver on its promises.  It's 
actually worse than just leaving things the way they had been before any 
of this stuff showed up.


Just imagine what companies would look like if their hiring processes 
filtered out this kind of charlatan instead of looking for whether they 
could do some dumb coding card trick in a 45 minute interview block.
I think they'd look very different, and a whole bunch of people would 
have to find another industry to prey upon.]]></summary>

November was a very rainy month in Victoria, a perfect time for experiments in the galley. We are growing Lion's Mane mushrooms currently (a first for us), and we are continuing to lacto-ferment vegetables like kohlrabi, turnips, daikon, cauliflower and red onion. To learn how to do it, see our guide to lactofermentation.
Pino book club
We're reading The Summer Book by Tove Jansson (it's such a lovely book).

Their bosses went nuts. The former employers of these workers slammed them as lazy and greedy, and called upon their fellow bougies to take up "unskilled" labor and scab those proles back into the workplace.

Yeah, me too. Can't we catch a break? Maybe. Step one to preventing new, scarier mutant strains is to reduce the number of infected people, which require a mix of ventilation, masking, distancing, and, of course, vaccinations.

In theory, this should have exterminated surveillance-based "behavioral" ads. In practice, nothing of the sort has happened…yet. Let's look at the theory first.

Back in 2015 I set myself an goal to publish at least two posts a month, for the most part I've managed. I've always been a fan of "easy goals" - something that's achievable without it causing stress - so doing some writing twice a month definitely hit that sweet spot.

“file not found” even though the program I was running existed. It’s something
I’ve run into before, but every time I’m very surprised and confused by it

So let’s talk about what happened and why!

serve.go, and I was trying to bundle it into a Docker container with this

I’ve been writing more frontend code in the last year or two – I’ve been making a bunch of little Vue projects. (for example nginx playground, sql playground, this dns lookup tool, and a couple of others)
My general approach to frontend development has been pretty “pretend it’s 2005” – I usually
have an index.html file, a script.js file, and then I do a <script
src="script.js"> and that’s it. You can see an example of that approach here.
This has been working mostly ok for me, but sometimes I run into problems. So I
wanted to talk about one of those problems, a solution I found
(esbuild!), and what I needed to learn to solve the problem (some very basic facts about how npm builds work).
Some of the facts in this post might
be wrong because still I don’t understand Javascript build s…]]></summary>

How to make your own game engine (and why) by Tyler Glaiel
Well worth a read.
In my 35+ year career in games I've never used an off the shelf game engine.  Starting with SCUMM I've always build my own.  I love the power and the freedom.  It's hard work and probably cost me more but I love making game engines and writing compilers.  It's a skill you slowly acquire and after the 5th one it's not a daunting task anymore.
I ran into a programmer at an indie meet-up and she told me this story about how another programmer at her company brought up building their own game engine.  Someone responded with "What! Are you Ron Gilbert!"
I wear that as a badge of honor.  😀]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think this might be one of the first balanced or non-invested reads of what "Web3" means and Sloan's opening notes really resonate:

It’s for kids. I mean that in a good way! I think Web3 has resonated powerfully with young people because it feels like something genuinely new, and it feels like it can be theirs. Who could argue with those feelings? Not me.

The notes go on and I come away with the same general sense that I've had so far of the crowd cheering on for Web3: it's about making money. Which is fine, the world runs on capitalism for the most part, it's just not entirely for me.
And I think that's the rub, the stories I know of the creation and the spread of the web (and indeed the internet) came from those wanting to share and do good. The stories I've read were never about making money but instead creating a place for others.
I will concede that I don't tend to read the "got rich by selling X web start up" - but it's that start in the web that's what drives me, and what I love about the web. It's what I love about the Open Web.
Web Zero if you will. It was about sharing, community, learning and finding a place in the world.

In a Star Trek vs. Star Wars internet argument I am firmly in the Star Trek camp and this is with eight years of working at The Death Star Lucasfilm (I kid, working at Lucasfilm was magical but I'm still a Star Trek person).
Star Trek used be be about hope.  Even in the dark days of the 1960's cold war you could see hope for our future in Star Trek. They mange to comment on our then messed up world while being optimistic about the future. It's a lesson current Star Trek could learn from.
Next Generation followed in that tradition. There was conflict but also hope in what the future could be.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In writing about my dumb little "mailserv" project this past weekend, I 
purposely avoided mentioning some of the parameters lest they distract 
from the message I was trying to convey.  My attempted message was 
something along the lines of "everyone starts somewhere, ignorance is 
the default state until changed, and look at some of the shit I have 
inflicted upon the world as proof".


In the case of the mailserv project, that is, the thing that did what 
we'd call "greylisting" today, it ran on an auxiliary box that itself 
only existed because of yet another terrible hack involving a second T1 
and the systemic inability to run BGP properly.  I've talked about the 
finer points of that before, and it's not really on topic here.  But, 
keep in mind that it meant from 1997 forward, I had a machine running 
Squid just so we could push some web traffic out this secondary 
(fractional) T1 to take the load off the main circuit.


It was relatively cheap shit, and it had no special "server" features.





That's a Pentium 150 with 128 megabytes of memory, a (PATA!) IDE hard 
drive with just 1.6 GB of space, a 10 Mbps Ethernet card, plus a video 
card, CD-ROM drive and Sound Blaster that meant nothing, because it was 
a server.  (The SB16, incidentally, proves this was intended to be a 
classroom box running Kid Pix for some elementary school students.)


All of this in 128 MB of memory and a gig and a half of disk space.


Instrumenting things to find slow points and trying to do something 
about it made for a bunch of little changes over the year or two that 
this spam filtering service existed.  Everything was driven by actual 
needs and a distinct lack of system resources.  It kept up with the load 
and stopped a great many things that otherwise would have annoyed my 
users.

This is just an example of what we did with what was available then.]]></summary>

post
late on a Saturday night.  For some reason, it tends to bring out 
THE ONE
more than any other time of the week.  I wonder why that is.


I mean, you're not wrong... but how's the rest of that quote go?


Recall that it turned into a situation where the individual components 
of the query (ip, helo, from, to) were now in their own tables, so they 
all had a number now - the "id" column.  I figured, okay, I need to 
obtain those little suckers before I can build a query with them, so 
let's query!


So, yep, I fired off four queries to get four numbers, then built up a 
query, then fired that off as a fifth to get my results.


Did I mention that I obviously didn't know the first thing about JOIN 
back then?  It took several more years for that to happen organically.

Go on, bag on me for being ignorant.  I know what that really means.]]></summary>

        <id>https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2021/11/05/sevenbits/</id>
        <link href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2021/11/05/sevenbits/"/>
        <updated>2021-11-05T07:13:18.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last November, I put up a
list
of a bunch of "magic numbers" including some years in which time/date 
stuff is likely to break.  There's 2036 for the NTP era rollover, 2038 
for time_t requiring 32 bits in January *and* another GPS week rollover 
in November.


Looking at the current year gives you a hint.  It's 2021, but another 
way of looking at that is that we're 121 years past the year 1900.  A 
fair number of things use(d) 1900 as an epoch, base year, or just an 
offset of sorts.  Why?  Well, they were probably invented in simpler 
times when the current year wasn't quite that far from 1900 at the time, 
and it would fit into fewer bits.  Specifically, it'll fit into just 
seven bits... until 2028, that is.


So, if someone used 1900 as their base year, stored years relative to 
that, and then did it in just seven bits (or eight bits where one of 
them is a sign bit), it'll overflow in a little over six years.  What 
happens then depends on which method was used, and whether it applies 
certain kinds of sanity checks.

1773.  Neat!


I originally spotted this thanks to a 
bug report type comment
on an epitaph (!) on HN.  That one is about ISO 9660 (CD/DVD stuff) 
software and how it handles years.

similar
was found in the Linux kernel in 2015 (and appears to have been 
patched).

reference to this same problem
that might be useful if you're trying to keep your HP 3000 alive.  You 
know, the things with the 
300+ lb disk drives?  
(If you know, you know.)


Wikipedia does have 2028 in their epic
list
of time formatting and storage bugs, naturally, but it only talks about 
systems from the '70s.  It doesn't mention ISO 9660 at all - at the 
moment, that is.  Perhaps someone in the know will update it and then 
this comment will be obsolete.


...


Eleven bits!  Luxury!  Ah, well, guess what happens in 2048?  Yep!


Finally, one random thing for anyone who's not already aware: try
log2(n) to get a feel for how big a number is in binary.  Neat, right?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was looking into problems people were having with DNS a few months ago and I
noticed one common theme – a lot of people have server issues (“my server is
down! or it’s slow!“), but they can’t tell if the problem is caused by DNS or
not.
So here are a few tools I use to tell if a problem I’m having is caused by DNS,
as well as a few DNS debuggging stories from my life.
I don’t try to interpret browser error messages
First, let’s talk briefly about browser error messages. You might think that
your browser will tell you if the problem is DNS or not! And it could but
mine doesn’t seem to do so in any obvious way.
On my machine, if Firefox fails to resolve DNS for a site, it gives me the
error: Hmm. We’re having trouble finding that site. We can’t connect to the
server at bananas.wizardzines.…]]></summary>

Summary Of Changes
donsol, ported our Famicom(6502) code to Varvara(uxn).
uxn, wrote a reference guide and created a list of community projects.
noodle, added guides for the line and rectangle tool and updated shortcuts in the documentation.

News
This month, we found a used grain mill for Pino! Flour doesn't keep as well as whole grains, so we decided to start milling flour (wheat berries, soy beans or chickpeas) only as we need it. We only released a Guide to Lacto-fermenting vegetables on grimgrains.
Donsol is now available as an uxn rom on itchio.
See Devine's daily drawings series for October.
Pino book club
We're continuing our readings of The Stories of Ray Bradbury by Ray Bradbury. Favorite shorts this month include The Long Rain, The City and Kaleidoscope.

I'd known the story for many years, but didn't realise it was written in the 70s (or "nearly 80s"). My best knowledge of it was the movie with Martin Freeman in 2005 … which, didn't quite live up to my expectation round the hype.
The book I found to be better (than the film - sorry purists - I know I shouldn't compare!), though I couldn't stop hearing Alan Rickman's voice as Marvin.
I did sort of feel like nothing actually happened in the book. It was an adventure, but I think I missed the character arcs - or… I wasn't sure where to look!
Overall, good, funny and properly silly.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Almost ten years ago,
I wrote an obscure post about something that would have only made sense 
if you also worked at Google at the time it happened (around 2010).  It 
was a reference to an Xtranormal video that someone created about the 
perils of trying to get your stuff running in production without having 
someone hate on you for "doing it wrong".


When it came out, I took a screenshot of the long-suffering engineer 
(some kind of red panda/fox girl thing) and had a T-shirt made from it.  
I wore it to work a few times to great effect.  It was our own little 
internal joke within the company.


Ready?  
Here it is.


As for everything in the video, it is really close to what the reality 
of production was back in the day.  Things were actually quite a bit 
worse than what it suggests, if you can believe it.  The whole thing 
about "get quota in two cells" misses the fact that it was damn near 
impossible to get the quota you needed across multiple services 
(compute, storage, ...) in the same place at the same time.


So, if you heard stories about software engineers doing shady deals to 
trade quota between teams so they could get all of the stuff in the 
same spot?  Yep, this is where those came from.  That's the kind of 
thing that was happening.  People had to blow time and energy on 
worrying about that kind of thing instead of working on whatever they 
were supposed to be doing.


I'm sure my non-solution probably bit someone later.  Sorry, whoever.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A couple of weeks ago, I read a
post
about how the "sealed system" on Big Sur was hurting people.  I kind of 
skimmed through it and figured it was mostly complaining about the 
size of the download.  For whatever reason, that hadn't been a problem 
for me and my machines, so I kind of wrote it off.


For a good number of years, I've been (foolishly, as it turns out) using 
the included Apache httpd to run small localhost-only stuff on my Mac 
laptop.  In recent times, I found that every upgrade of the OS would 
revert my httpd.conf and it would need to be put back.


Why would it matter if the sshd config got reverted?  Simple: it's 
because the stock Mac sshd install includes password-based auth, and 
that means someone can brute-force their way onto your machine if they 
can connect to …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're riding the bleeding edge of Mac software updates, you might 
have just installed Monterey, or you will soon.  If you're also running 
sshd so you can log in remotely, you should be aware that the typical 
"revert your config" shenanigans have happened, so you are
once again
accepting password authentication, and thus are subject to a brute-force 
attack.


Editing that file would likely get reverted upon the next patch 
(12.0.2?), so that's right out.  You can't go past it with a higher 
number, since as the sshd_config points out, the *first* instance of a 
setting is kept, and subsequent instances of the same setting are 
ignored.



UsePAM no
PasswordAuthentication no



Finally, after you make this change, make sure it actually worked by 
forcing a password/interactive-only login attempt to the machine.  Make 
sure it fails and doesn't ask you for a password.  If you don't know how 
to do this, the
previous post
contains info on that, including a terrible scanner script that belongs 
in the bottom of a cat box.

But now, without JS, you only get the first few lines of content, and the rest is loaded entirely with JS - which… is stupid.
Scribe fixes all that and focuses entirely on the author's content.
I also used the FAQ to auto redirect and now I can read the full content without being distracted by Medium's horrid cruft.
Great example of taking back the web.

the person explains some things which I don’t know, but which I don’t think

the person starts giving a relevant explanation, but using terminology that
I don’t understand, so I still end up being confused
