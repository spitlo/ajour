The neptUNO works well as a middle weight retro gaming/platform machine. It can run Spectrum (and the new Spectrum Next), C64, NES, Megadrive, SNES, PC Engine, Amiga 500, Vectrex, original arcade like Galaxian and Bubble Bobble and some more.

It makes me wonder, is there a simple alternative for those non-docker devs 🤔

Safari is not a modern browser - this is literally what devs and designers complained about IE6 for years.


Still, read Alex's post - it's packed full of data (as usual) and draws a clear conclusion that Apple, again, are delaying progress for the world wide web.
