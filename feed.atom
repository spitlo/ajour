good examples. I haven’t seen a lot written about how to make examples, so
here’s a little bit about my approach to writing examples!
The basic idea here is to start with real code that you wrote and then remove

examples.
good examples are realistic
To see why examples should be realistic, let’s first talk about an unrealistic

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ready for release.
After nearly ten months of tinkering in the evening, the Marbles Squared ZX Spectrum Next port is going live this weekend.
It's not that it actually took 10 months to develop, it's just along the way I learnt and wrote the code grid handling in assembly, and then I wrote an assembly based dot command that handles HTTP requests both getting and posting data to web servers - and this is now part of the official spectrum core code (which will ship in future machines) - so that's a nice bonus.
I'm fairly confident there's no lurking bugs, though I am trying to squash one non blocking issue where the game can't get the high scores from the web (though oddly the game was able to post the high score for the player in question 🤔). Still, I think it's looking pretty snazzy:

All the same, the itch download page is primed and ready for release on Saturday. There's two downloads available: the game and the game with fully documented source code and PDF overview article.
In lieu of the release, I've been looking back at the original version I wrote in the early 2000s and found a web based Palm Pilot emulator that let me actually play and capture screenshots of the original game (I even managed to recover the source code and published it on github). So I present to you - the old version:

Once the game is live for the Spectrum I'll release the web version and if I planned the code right, we'll all be able to contribute to the high score leader board!]]></summary>

To pull a specific file, say the last commit, the following command line does the trick:
git show HEAD^:./myfile.bin > myfile.bin

The HEAD^ means "one commit behind the head of the branch" (the "head" being the last commit on the branch). Though if you've got merge commits where a commit has more than one parent commit this can get a little complicated (which why I tend to stick to just the previous commit).
Using HEAD^^ or HEAD^2 means "two commits before the head of the branch". There's also detailed stackoverflow post about the difference between the caret ^ and the tilde ~ with examples of how they traverse up the tree.]]></summary>

It might seem counterintuitive to start the process of receiving feedback with a question, but that makes sense if we realize that getting feedback can be thought of as a form of design research. In the same way that we wouldn’t do any research without the right questions to get the insights that we need, the best way to ask for feedback is also to craft sharp questions.
Design critique is not a one-shot process. Sure, any good feedback workflow continues until the project is finished, but this is particularly true for design because design wor…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zzo38 is undoubtedly the most prolific of esolangers. In addition to his long list of fully developed esolangs are his unimplemented ideas and experiments. He has been creating languages since 1994 with DZZZZ, a Funge-like language not much younger than Befunge. 


» Is there a meaning behind your pseudonym zzo38?

"ZZO" is like "ZZT", which is a DOS-based game engine I have used in the past (and still do). (ZZT wasn't Free software at the time, but it is now.)

The numbers 3 and 8 are from I wanted to decorate a pillow with numbers but those are the only numbers they had.

» Your list on the esolangs wiki of unusual features of languages is fascinating, e.g. how COBOL can change the locations GOTOs point to. Do you draw from these in designing your own languages? What are the most esoteric features you've found in non-esoteric languages? What do you consider the most non-intentionally-esoteric language?

It had been said that PostScript is both esoteric and non-esoteric at the same time. Additionally, I would think PostScript is both general-purpose and domain-specific at the same time, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When using postgres locally for development, sometimes, if the production dataset is too large, I'll take a sample to work with locally.
More recently I've run into the problem that when I load new production data into tables with auto increment primary key columns, I'll get a conflict, i.e. I load some production data in locally, and then when the auto increment runs it'll hit a conflict - because my local sequences are completely out of sync with production.
The solution is to update my local sequence value. This is a two part process.
1. Capture current values from production:
SELECT last_value FROM public.<table>_<col>_seq;

So for something like user ids, this would be:
SELECT last_value FROM public.user_id_seq;
>>> 304

If this doesn't yield a result, then the sequence name is wrong, and it can be checked with the following query:
SELECT pg_get_serial_sequence('user', 'id');

Now armed with this value, in my example 304, the next part is to upload locally:
2. Update sequences locally:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! Quick announcement: I opened a new print zine
store last week, so now you can buy print
copies of my zines! To start I’ve printed 350 copies of each of the “Bite
Size…” zines.
Here’s a photo of the front of the zines and some stickers:
and the back covers:



Here are some notes about how the store works:
great print quality!
I worked with a really good print company (Girlie Press) and printed the zines on some nice paper,
so they look WAY nicer than they do when printed on a home printer :). I’m

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After I got used to the technical aspect of the writing, a really engrossing story.
The book is written in a way that quite often ends right in the middle of a train of thought. Reading on a kindle it was hard to work out if it was intentional or if there was a problem with the Kindle edition! After a while I got used to it, and learnt to just to either let go of the sentiment or ignore it.
The story uses time jumping a lot but thankfully the book is written in a way that it was easy to know when we had jumped back or forwards through time.
The story is set in a dystopian alternative reality, which frankly isn't far from our reality now and it's easy to see how our society could get there. Which makes the entire story even more scary.
The story primarily follows Theo Miller a person who has lived in the world as it becomes worse and just gone along with it because "that's just the way the world works".
