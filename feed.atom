“file not found” even though the program I was running existed. It’s something

So let’s talk about what happened and why!

serve.go, and I was trying to bundle it into a Docker container with this

I’ve been writing more frontend code in the last year or two – I’ve been making a bunch of little Vue projects. (for example nginx playground, sql playground, this dns lookup tool, and a couple of others)
My general approach to frontend development has been pretty “pretend it’s 2005” – I usually
have an index.html file, a script.js file, and then I do a <script
src="script.js"> and that’s it. You can see an example of that approach here.
This has been working mostly ok for me, but sometimes I run into problems. So I
wanted to talk about one of those problems, a solution I found
(esbuild!), and what I needed to learn to solve the problem (some very basic facts about how npm builds work).
Some of the facts in this post might
be wrong because still I don’t understand Javascript build s…]]></summary>

How to make your own game engine (and why) by Tyler Glaiel
Well worth a read.
In my 35+ year career in games I've never used an off the shelf game engine.  Starting with SCUMM I've always build my own.  I love the power and the freedom.  It's hard work and probably cost me more but I love making game engines and writing compilers.  It's a skill you slowly acquire and after the 5th one it's not a daunting task anymore.
I ran into a programmer at an indie meet-up and she told me this story about how another programmer at her company brought up building their own game engine.  Someone responded with "What! Are you Ron Gilbert!"
I wear that as a badge of honor.  😀]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think this might be one of the first balanced or non-invested reads of what "Web3" means and Sloan's opening notes really resonate:

It’s for kids. I mean that in a good way! I think Web3 has resonated powerfully with young people because it feels like something genuinely new, and it feels like it can be theirs. Who could argue with those feelings? Not me.

The notes go on and I come away with the same general sense that I've had so far of the crowd cheering on for Web3: it's about making money. Which is fine, the world runs on capitalism for the most part, it's just not entirely for me.
And I think that's the rub, the stories I know of the creation and the spread of the web (and indeed the internet) came from those wanting to share and do good. The stories I've read were never about making money but instead creating a place for others.
I will concede that I don't tend to read the "got rich by selling X web start up" - but it's that start in the web that's what drives me, and what I love about the web. It's what I love about the Open Web.
Web Zero if you will. It was about sharing, community, learning and finding a place in the world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yes, I'm tired of dystopia fiction. A sentiment I probably didn't need to repeat because it's in the title, but I really am.  Nothing points this out more to me than Star Trek.
In a Star Trek vs. Star Wars internet argument I am firmly in the Star Trek camp and this is with eight years of working at The Death Star Lucasfilm (I kid, working at Lucasfilm was magical but I'm still a Star Trek person).
Star Trek used be be about hope.  Even in the dark days of the 1960's cold war you could see hope for our future in Star Trek. They mange to comment on our then messed up world while being optimistic about the future. It's a lesson current Star Trek could learn from.
Next Generation followed in that tradition. There was conflict but also hope in what the future could be.

        <updated>2021-11-08T09:51:09.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In writing about my dumb little "mailserv" project this past weekend, I 
purposely avoided mentioning some of the parameters lest they distract 
from the message I was trying to convey.  My attempted message was 
something along the lines of "everyone starts somewhere, ignorance is 
the default state until changed, and look at some of the shit I have 
inflicted upon the world as proof".


In the case of the mailserv project, that is, the thing that did what 
we'd call "greylisting" today, it ran on an auxiliary box that itself 
only existed because of yet another terrible hack involving a second T1 
and the systemic inability to run BGP properly.  I've talked about the 
finer points of that before, and it's not really on topic here.  But, 
keep in mind that it meant from 1997 forward, I had a machine running 
Squid just so we could push some web traffic out this secondary 
(fractional) T1 to take the load off the main circuit.


It was relatively cheap shit, and it had no special "server" features.





That's a Pentium 150 with 128 megabytes of memory, a (PATA!) IDE hard 
drive with just 1.6 GB of space, a 10 Mbps Ethernet card, plus a video 
card, CD-ROM drive and Sound Blaster that meant nothing, because it was 
a server.  (The SB16, incidentally, proves this was intended to be a 
classroom box running Kid Pix for some elementary school students.)


All of this in 128 MB of memory and a gig and a half of disk space.


Instrumenting things to find slow points and trying to do something 
about it made for a bunch of little changes over the year or two that 
this spam filtering service existed.  Everything was driven by actual 
needs and a distinct lack of system resources.  It kept up with the load 
and stopped a great many things that otherwise would have annoyed my 
users.

This is just an example of what we did with what was available then.]]></summary>

post
late on a Saturday night.  For some reason, it tends to bring out 
THE ONE
more than any other time of the week.  I wonder why that is.


I mean, you're not wrong... but how's the rest of that quote go?


Recall that it turned into a situation where the individual components 
of the query (ip, helo, from, to) were now in their own tables, so they 
all had a number now - the "id" column.  I figured, okay, I need to 
obtain those little suckers before I can build a query with them, so 
let's query!


So, yep, I fired off four queries to get four numbers, then built up a 
query, then fired that off as a fifth to get my results.


Did I mention that I obviously didn't know the first thing about JOIN 
back then?  It took several more years for that to happen organically.

Go on, bag on me for being ignorant.  I know what that really means.]]></summary>

        <id>https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2021/11/05/sevenbits/</id>
        <link href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2021/11/05/sevenbits/"/>
        <updated>2021-11-05T07:13:18.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last November, I put up a
list
of a bunch of "magic numbers" including some years in which time/date 
stuff is likely to break.  There's 2036 for the NTP era rollover, 2038 
for time_t requiring 32 bits in January *and* another GPS week rollover 
in November.


Looking at the current year gives you a hint.  It's 2021, but another 
way of looking at that is that we're 121 years past the year 1900.  A 
fair number of things use(d) 1900 as an epoch, base year, or just an 
offset of sorts.  Why?  Well, they were probably invented in simpler 
times when the current year wasn't quite that far from 1900 at the time, 
and it would fit into fewer bits.  Specifically, it'll fit into just 
seven bits... until 2028, that is.


So, if someone used 1900 as their base year, stored years relative to 
that, and then did it in just seven bits (or eight bits where one of 
them is a sign bit), it'll overflow in a little over six years.  What 
happens then depends on which method was used, and whether it applies 
certain kinds of sanity checks.

1773.  Neat!


I originally spotted this thanks to a 
bug report type comment
on an epitaph (!) on HN.  That one is about ISO 9660 (CD/DVD stuff) 
software and how it handles years.

similar
was found in the Linux kernel in 2015 (and appears to have been 
patched).

reference to this same problem
that might be useful if you're trying to keep your HP 3000 alive.  You 
know, the things with the 
300+ lb disk drives?  
(If you know, you know.)


Wikipedia does have 2028 in their epic
list
of time formatting and storage bugs, naturally, but it only talks about 
systems from the '70s.  It doesn't mention ISO 9660 at all - at the 
moment, that is.  Perhaps someone in the know will update it and then 
this comment will be obsolete.


...


Eleven bits!  Luxury!  Ah, well, guess what happens in 2048?  Yep!


Finally, one random thing for anyone who's not already aware: try
log2(n) to get a feel for how big a number is in binary.  Neat, right?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was looking into problems people were having with DNS a few months ago and I
noticed one common theme – a lot of people have server issues (“my server is
down! or it’s slow!“), but they can’t tell if the problem is caused by DNS or
not.
So here are a few tools I use to tell if a problem I’m having is caused by DNS,
as well as a few DNS debuggging stories from my life.
I don’t try to interpret browser error messages
First, let’s talk briefly about browser error messages. You might think that
your browser will tell you if the problem is DNS or not! And it could but
mine doesn’t seem to do so in any obvious way.
On my machine, if Firefox fails to resolve DNS for a site, it gives me the
error: Hmm. We’re having trouble finding that site. We can’t connect to the
server at bananas.wizardzines.…]]></summary>

Summary Of Changes
donsol, ported our Famicom(6502) code to Varvara(uxn).
uxn, wrote a reference guide and created a list of community projects.
noodle, added guides for the line and rectangle tool and updated shortcuts in the documentation.

News
This month, we found a used grain mill for Pino! Flour doesn't keep as well as whole grains, so we decided to start milling flour (wheat berries, soy beans or chickpeas) only as we need it. We only released a Guide to Lacto-fermenting vegetables on grimgrains.
Donsol is now available as an uxn rom on itchio.
See Devine's daily drawings series for October.
Pino book club
We're continuing our readings of The Stories of Ray Bradbury by Ray Bradbury. Favorite shorts this month include The Long Rain, The City and Kaleidoscope.

I'd known the story for many years, but didn't realise it was written in the 70s (or "nearly 80s"). My best knowledge of it was the movie with Martin Freeman in 2005 … which, didn't quite live up to my expectation round the hype.
The book I found to be better (than the film - sorry purists - I know I shouldn't compare!), though I couldn't stop hearing Alan Rickman's voice as Marvin.
I did sort of feel like nothing actually happened in the book. It was an adventure, but I think I missed the character arcs - or… I wasn't sure where to look!
Overall, good, funny and properly silly.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Almost ten years ago,
I wrote an obscure post about something that would have only made sense 
if you also worked at Google at the time it happened (around 2010).  It 
was a reference to an Xtranormal video that someone created about the 
perils of trying to get your stuff running in production without having 
someone hate on you for "doing it wrong".


When it came out, I took a screenshot of the long-suffering engineer 
(some kind of red panda/fox girl thing) and had a T-shirt made from it.  
I wore it to work a few times to great effect.  It was our own little 
internal joke within the company.


Ready?  
Here it is.


As for everything in the video, it is really close to what the reality 
of production was back in the day.  Things were actually quite a bit 
worse than what it suggests, if you can believe it.  The whole thing 
about "get quota in two cells" misses the fact that it was damn near 
impossible to get the quota you needed across multiple services 
(compute, storage, ...) in the same place at the same time.


So, if you heard stories about software engineers doing shady deals to 
trade quota between teams so they could get all of the stuff in the 
same spot?  Yep, this is where those came from.  That's the kind of 
thing that was happening.  People had to blow time and energy on 
worrying about that kind of thing instead of working on whatever they 
were supposed to be doing.


I'm sure my non-solution probably bit someone later.  Sorry, whoever.]]></summary>

about how the "sealed system" on Big Sur was hurting people.  I kind of

for me and my machines, so I kind of wrote it off.


For a good number of years, I've been (foolishly, as it turns out) using 
the included Apache httpd to run small localhost-only stuff on my Mac 
laptop.  In recent times, I found that every upgrade of the OS would 
revert my httpd.conf and it would need to be put back.


Why would it matter if the sshd config got reverted?  Simple: it's 
because the stock Mac sshd install includes password-based auth, and 
that means someone can brute-force their way onto your machine if they

sshd so you can log in remotely, you should be aware that the typical 
"revert your config" shenanigans have happened, so you are
once again
accepting password authentication, and thus are subject to a brute-force 
attack.


Editing that file would likely get reverted upon the next patch 
(12.0.2?), so that's right out.  You can't go past it with a higher 
number, since as the sshd_config points out, the *first* instance of a 
setting is kept, and subsequent instances of the same setting are 
ignored.



UsePAM no
PasswordAuthentication no



Finally, after you make this change, make sure it actually worked by 
forcing a password/interactive-only login attempt to the machine.  Make 
sure it fails and doesn't ask you for a password.  If you don't know how 
to do this, the
previous post
contains info on that, including a terrible scanner script that belongs 
in the bottom of a cat box.

Enjoy.]]></summary>

But now, without JS, you only get the first few lines of content, and the rest is loaded entirely with JS - which… is stupid.
Scribe fixes all that and focuses entirely on the author's content.
I also used the FAQ to auto redirect and now I can read the full content without being distracted by Medium's horrid cruft.
Great example of taking back the web.

        <updated>2021-10-14T03:02:42.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the fun things I used to do at a prior job was to dig through the 
raw data points which were collected from the *many* servers we had.  I 
could just pick an interesting-sounding metric and then would just ask 
the system to show me the top 10 or bottom 10 out of a population of 
thousands or more.


To get my feet wet with the whole "investigations" thing that we'd do, I 
started looking into this one day and chose one of the many temp sensors 
which were being logged by the servers.  I forget exactly which one it 
was, for there were many.  The CPUs logged it, the chassis logged it, 
the power supply logged it, and so on.  There were so many choices.


I went looking for a reason.  What could possibly explain this?  First 
off, it didn't line up with any obvious pattern in the host names.  The 
hosts were named for whichever team owned them, followed by a sequence 
number that was bumped any time a new one was provisioned.  There was no 
signal to be found in that.


There was more, though.  You could also see a "rack position" in this 
data, and now it started getting interesting.  It seems that all of the 
really hot machines had a rack position of something low, like 04 or 05, 
and never anything higher than that.  In fact, when looking at a whole 
rack, it was always the lowest number of all of the positions that were 
being used.  Now this was worth chasing!


It's good that I asked, since they told me something surprising: 
position 04 or 05 or whatever was the *bottom* of the rack.  Yes, 
somehow, the lowest machine in the rack was the hottest!  They found 
this interesting, too, and wound up digging into it.  Given that I was 
far away in a distant office, this was the best way for us to proceed.


The problem was that the bottommost server would have nothing below it 
but just open space until it got to the floor.  That space would not 
move air efficiently, and it obviously mattered.


This rolled out and my hot spots disappeared.  Fantastic!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know I've already
commented
on a certain site's big outage
twice now,
but I have one more bit of rumor to share, and it apparently invalidates 
what I had heard previously.  That is, it may not have been a matter of 
"show X Y" vs. "clear X Y", but rather some kind of automation that went 
a bit too far.


Then, what if you didn't have to actually type something in to hit the 
button?  Maybe you forgot, or something else happened, and you didn't 
fill it in, so when you did that, it said "okay, cool then" and 
did all of them instead?


Go to tool, don't type in target, hit button, ALL targets affected.


It sounds like another kind of "footgun" (you know, something you can 
use to shoot yourself in the foot) from the world of databases: an 
UPDATE without a WHERE.



UPDATE my_table SET invalid = true WHERE asset_id = 1012;



Imagine what happens when you forget the WHERE.  It's the last thing on 
the line as shown, so you could send off the command early and it would 
totally work.  It would look like this:


And... guess what, without that WHERE, it just set that bit everywhere.  
Everything is marked invalid, and your business might suffer for it.


Final note on the "do all the things" thing: maybe the tool 
actually is supposed to let you do that.  In that case, maybe it would 
be good if it said something like "you are about to drain 123,456 
devices, so type in that exact number to proceed".  You know,
that
kind of thing.  It tends to add enough of a pause to prevent some 
disasters.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here's something fun I saw which created an outage once.  I've written 
about this
before,
but in light of yesterday's fun and games, I figured this one is worth 
another mention.


One way to do this on a Linux box with the usual GNU userspace stuff is 
to feed it to date, like this:


The problem is, there's another command very much like it that will even 
spit out the same output, only it has a nice little side-effect: it 
also sets the clock.  That command is date -s.


Another problem is that you might not have known that -s has that 
effect, and you have been using it because it gives you the output you 
want, and you don't realize what else it can do.


This then touched off a whole bunch of badness which I already talked 
about before.  It messed up other systems, and brought up questions of 
how to defend against it, and all of that other good stuff you'd expect 
to hear after a problem of that sort.

display everything, but instead it 
cleared everything.


show mpls lsp


clear mpls lsp


Hopefully the similarity to 'date -d' vs. 'date -s' is clear.

Small commands can have giant consequences.]]></summary>

I got a bunch of useful replies as always, so this blog post shows some tools
you can use to look up BGP information. There might be an above average number
of things wrong in this post because I don’t understand BGP that well.

I was reading Scott O’Hara’s article about using JavaScript to detect high contrast and dark modes, which includes a small, very useful script to do exactly what the title says. The output of that script at first looked like it was a “false positive”. But some further investigation led me to learn something new about the prefers-color-scheme CSS user query.

Scott’s article includes a Codepen to demonstrate the output of the script. The script will check and detect if you currently have high contrast mode or dark mode enabled, and will output the result of the check.

something from about a year ago.  If you follow the latest Linux type 
stuff, you probably remember this, but if not, this might seem new to 
you.  It's just something dumb and amusing.


Go grab a Linux box with glibc on it.  Then compile and run this C code:


Then run it and watch what happens.  If you have multiple machines, try 
it on some of them and compare the results.  If the results are 
different, why do you suppose that is?


Neat, right?  It makes me want to go looking for places where people are 
calling these functions with ints that I can control to see if I can 
blow it up.

to see how the sausage is made by someone who did the work already.

This is awesome because it's that many more possibilities.  I had been 
grepping source for "isalnum" to try to find inputs I can control, but 
now I realize that FAR more functions give a way into this.  Have fun!]]></summary>

The power receptacle appeared fine, but once we were ready to leave we found the male connection of our shore power cord had melted. Two out of three prongs were stuck in the receptacle. We've never had issues with our cord before, and for now we assume that the marina shore connection was faulty. Either way, we had to repair the power cord.
We always prefer to repair than to replace, so when we returned to a place with a marine store, we got ourselves replacements connections, both male and female, to replace the two damaged ends.
We thought we'd document the process of fixing a shower power cord. Although, this is only specific to Marinco marine fittings.

have an nginx playground website where you can just paste in an nginx config
and test it out. And then I realized it might actually be pretty easy to build,
so got excited and started coding and I built it. It’s at
https://nginx-playground.wizardzines.com.
Here’s a screenshot:

For the rest of the post I’m mostly going to talk about how I built the
project, because there were a few decisions that weren’t obvious to me.
how to use it
You need to enter both an nginx config and a curl or http command to make a
HTTP request to that nginx instance
And then you click “Run” in the top right, and it’ll output either:
the results of the command you executed (if nginx started successfully), or
the nginx error logs (if nginx …]]></summary>

Now, people are getting answers from Siri, Google search snippets, and mobile apps, not just our websites. Forward-thinking organizations have adopted an omnichannel content strategy, whose mission is to reach audiences across multiple digital channels and platforms.
But how do you set up a content management system (CMS) to reach your audience now and in the future? I learned the hard way that creating a content model—a definition of content types, attributes, and relationships that let people and systems understand content—with my more familiar design-system thinking would capsize my customer’s omnichannel content strategy. You can avoid that outcome by creating content models that are semantic and that also connect related content.…]]></summary>

On a Wednesday night not so long ago, someone opened a SEV (that is, a 
notification of something going wrong) and said the individual tasks for 
their service were "crash looping".  These things ran in an environment 
where they were supervised by the job runner, so if they died, they'd be 
restarted, but you never wanted to keep it in this kind of state.


It looked like this had started when some update had rolled out.  That

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2008, Mark Changizi, a Sloan-Swartz Fellow in Theoretical Neuroscience at Caltech, noted that the eye can make sense of complex relationships that often mystify the brain. 


Our everyday visual perceptions rely upon unfathomably complex computations carried out by tens of billions of neurons across over half our cortex. In spite of this, it does not “feel” like work to see. Our cognitive powers are, in stark contrast, “slow and painful,” and we have great trouble with embarrassingly simple logic tasks. 

Might it be possible to harness our visual computational powers for other tasks, perhaps for tasks cognition finds difficult? 


In other words, could we trick the eye into performing computation? 

Changizi proposed the Escher Circuit, "a special kind of image that amounts to 'visual software' our 'visual hardware' computes" merely through perception.

Escher Circuits work by creating different states corresponding to how the eye resolves ambiguous images. Its core component, the wire, holds a state of 0 when we perceive it as if we are to the right of it; otherwise, it holds a state of 1.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an older iPhone that used to be my daily driver.  It mostly just 
hangs around for testing random junk.  It's still getting updates, and 
so when Apple offered it iOS 15 today, I installed it.  This gave me a 
chance to turn on their beta "private relay" stuff which seems to be 
a TOR-like system.


What did surprise me is the lack of "stickiness" for these IP addresses.  
Every five seconds or so, it seems to hop to another address in the same 
(IPv6, remember) /64.  If you're not down with v6 conventions yet, this 
means the first four parts like "xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx" stay the same, but 
the last four change completely every time.


I actually don't have any v4-only (aka LEGACY) stuff to try it on, so I 
have no idea what happens on that side of the world.  It probably looks 
about the same, albeit within a much smaller range of possible source IP 
addresses.  It probably resembles a CGNAT type situation.

It'll be fun to see what this breaks, and who howls the loudest.]]></summary>
