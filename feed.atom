        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zzo38 is undoubtedly the most prolific of esolangers. In addition to his long list of fully developed esolangs are his unimplemented ideas and experiments. He has been creating languages since 1994 with DZZZZ, a Funge-like language not much younger than Befunge. 


» Is there a meaning behind your pseudonym zzo38?

"ZZO" is like "ZZT", which is a DOS-based game engine I have used in the past (and still do). (ZZT wasn't Free software at the time, but it is now.)

The numbers 3 and 8 are from I wanted to decorate a pillow with numbers but those are the only numbers they had.

» Your list on the esolangs wiki of unusual features of languages is fascinating, e.g. how COBOL can change the locations GOTOs point to. Do you draw from these in designing your own languages? What are the most esoteric features you've found in non-esoteric languages? What do you consider the most non-intentionally-esoteric language?

It had been said that PostScript is both esoteric and non-esoteric at the same time. Additionally, I would think PostScript is both general-purpose and domain-specific at the same time, too.

Firefox recently updated with a System Theme that would change when the system went from light to dark and back again, but I wasn't personally so keen on the light theme.
The excellent Firefox Color lets me easily customise and adjust the theme, but at the cost of having to manually switch between light and dark. So I wrote an extension to do it for me!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When using postgres locally for development, sometimes, if the production dataset is too large, I'll take a sample to work with locally.
More recently I've run into the problem that when I load new production data into tables with auto increment primary key columns, I'll get a conflict, i.e. I load some production data in locally, and then when the auto increment runs it'll hit a conflict - because my local sequences are completely out of sync with production.
The solution is to update my local sequence value. This is a two part process.
1. Capture current values from production:
SELECT last_value FROM public.<table>_<col>_seq;

So for something like user ids, this would be:
SELECT last_value FROM public.user_id_seq;
>>> 304

If this doesn't yield a result, then the sequence name is wrong, and it can be checked with the following query:
SELECT pg_get_serial_sequence('user', 'id');

Now armed with this value, in my example 304, the next part is to upload locally:
2. Update sequences locally:
ALTER SEQUENCE <table>_<col>_seq RESTART WITH <next_value>;

It's important that I update to the next value, not the current value:
ALTER SEQUENCE user_id_seq RESTART WITH 305;

Now when the next id for the user is loaded through an insert, the sequences are in sync.]]></summary>

Feedback is also one of the most underestimated tools, and often by assuming that we’re already good at it, we settle, forgetting that it’s a skill that can be trained, grown, and improved. Poor feedback can create confusion in projects, bring down morale, and affect trust and team collaboration over the long term. Quality feedback can be a transformative force. 
Practicing our skills is surely a good way to improve, but the learning gets even faster when it’s paired with a good foundation that channels and focuses the practice. What are some foundational…]]></summary>
