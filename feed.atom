DNS resolvers work.
In this post, I want to explain how DNS resolvers work in a different way –
with a short Go program that does the same thing described in the comic.
The main function (resolve) is actually just 20 lines, including comments.
I usually find it easier to understand things work when they come in the form
of programs that I can run and modify and poke at, so hopefully this program
will be helpful to some of you.
The program is here: https://github.com/jvns/tiny-resolver/blob/main/resolve.go

When your browser needs to make a DNS query, it asks a DNS resolvers. When

straightforward (there aren’t enough IPv4 addresses for all the devices on the
internet, so people invented IPv6! There are enough IPv6 addresses for
everyone!)
But when I try to actually understand it, I run into a lot of questions. One
question is: twitter.com does not support IPv6. Presumably it can’t be causing
them THAT many issues to not support it. So why do websites support IPv6?
I asked people on Twitter why their servers support IPv6
and I got a lot of great answers, which I’ll summarize here. These all come
with the disclaimer that I have basically 0 experience with IPv6 so I can’t evaluate these reasons very well.

what you're looking at here.




I do remember the description from the back: this is a picture of *part 
of* something that was called the Software Creations BBS.  It was a 
multi-line bulletin board system where you could dial up and send 
messages to people, upload and download files, and (presumably) play 
online games ("doors") and anything else they cared to offer.

64 machines in a little space.  I have to assume 
they are at least 
286s (ATs, more or 
less), but it's impossible to tell from just this picture.  They could 
have been 386s or even 486s by that point, but …]]></summary>

a picture of an old multi-line bulletin board system which had 
apparently taken over an entire bedroom with dozens of computers.  I 
mentioned that I intended to come back to the topic to throw in my own 
two cents, and so here we go.


Or, were you someone who found it horrific and wished there was a 
simpler way?  Did you wonder if it would be possible to pack all of that 
into one or maybe two boxes, instead?  Did you want a way to negate all 
of that complexity while still providing the same level of service?


Now, things are different.  I look at that and just sigh at the lost 
opportunities.  The actual amount of work being done on behalf of any of 
the users who are connected is tiny.  If we ignore the fact that the

example of DNS problems they’ve run into, especially DNS problems that didn’t
initially appear to be DNS problems. (the popular “it’s always DNS” meme)
I’m not going to discuss how to solve or avoid any of these problems in this
post, but I’ve linked to webpages discussing the problem where I could find
them.

nameserver.
I’m writing this because if you made a DNS update and it didn’t work, there are 2 options:
Your authoritative nameserver doesn’t have the correct record
Your authoritative nameserver does have the correct record, but an old record is cached and you need to wait for the cache to expire
To be able to tell which one is happening (do you need to make a change, or do
you just need to wait?), you need to be able to find your domain’s
authoritative nameserver and query it to see what records it has.
But when I looked up “how to find a domain’s authoritative nameserver” to see
what advice was out there, I found a lot of different methods being mentioned,
some of which can give you the wrong answer.

decentralized. There are thousands (maybe hundreds of thousands? I don’t know!) of authoritative nameservers, and at least
10 million resolvers.
And they’re running lots of different software! All these different servers
running software means that there’s a lot of inconsistency in how DNS works,
which can cause all kinds of frustrating problems.
But instead of talking about the problems, I’m interested in figuring out –
why is it a good thing that DNS is decentralized?

One reason is scalability – the decentralized design of DNS makes it

I recorded 21 books on my Kindle this year, but actually one of them was read aloud to the kids (Which I do still count) but another one was all of 19 pages… which, I think really doesn't count (it was Home: Habitat, Range, Niche, Territory by Martha Wells). So… 20 books then.
This post is mostly data driven (from my own web site's data) to give me a sense of the quality of the books I've read, otherwise individual reviews are all linked in this post or available on my books page.]]></summary>

on wizard zines.
Here are some thoughts about what I’m working towards, a bunch of things I made
this year, and a few ideas and questions about 2022.

I think the two hardest things about working for myself are working alone and
having to decide what to do.
This year I spent some time trying to figure out what I’m doing with wizard
zines. This is hard for me because I work in a pretty intuitive way – I have
some feelings about what’s important, and even though following my feelings
usually turns out well, I can’t always explain what I’m trying to do.
Here are some thoughts about what I’m trying to do:

Playing a game these days feels like as much of a financial investment as it becomes a life investment. I find myself drawn more and more to spelunking itch.io for tiny hidden gems… getting lost while diving into all the developer pages filled with all these odd little works. Browsing itch or GameJolt has become almost as rewarding...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lovely but I found the language almost too distracting.
Only right at the end of the book did I consider that maybe I really wasn't the right audience for the story - as it seemed to smack of "millennium type problems". Using air quotes in my description because I'm fairly sure this is a patronising statement I'm making!
The Dex character feels discontent with their achievements and is struggling to find fulfilling meaning. Their work has meaning to others but they're left feeling empty. Obviously it's an impossible measure as life trondles forward and achievements change with time.
For me it was only really when Dex meets the Robot (whose name I've already forgotten) when the book became more engaging. It was like the Dex character could be challenged and some real depth was offered (for better or worse for Dex's personality).
But what I did struggle with was the language and the odd shoehorning of gender pronouns. Dex is neither "he" or "she", so Chamber's settles with using the "they" pronoun. This led to my own confusion regularly thinking the lines I was reading was referring to Dex and another character that was in the scene.
The sore-thumb moment is when Dex asks, interestingly, what pronoun the Robot uses, and the Robot responds with "it" and it refers to itself as an object. Dex replies with (something like) they are the same, and their pronoun is "they". This seemed like a potentially interesting exchange between the Robot and Dex about the subject of how one refers to oneself and how they identify, but it doesn't happen. It just has that exchange, and then the story returns to what they were doing and carries on. It felt jarring and like Chamber's wanted to discuss this topic, but instead shoe horned it in.
I do also suspect that my trouble with the language is a me-thing and probably with practice it won't cause me as much (or any) confusion, but for now, and this book, it definitely affected how I enjoyed the story.]]></summary>

working on a project with some friends.  By virtue of being in a very 
large company, we had quite the assortment of libraries which could be 
brought in to do stuff.  Given that we had a "would be nice" item on our 
feature list that involved doing something with the filesystem, I went 
looking for a matching feature, and it turned into a security dumpster 
fire.  Here's what happened.


When you're in that situation, you can't just mkdir() the final path.  
It won't work.  You have to start from the top and work your way down.  
The ones which already exist will probably fail with -EEXIST, so 
sometimes it makes more sense to look at what's there, work your way 
down, and then start the mkdir calls when you find that p…]]></summary>

Clayton and I did this back in Dec of 2004.  Interesting how much hasn't changed. I'd have more "male" spouses now, something about loot crates and IAP, kissing up to steamers, and maybe change the last verse to be more "indie", but its shockingly accurate years later.
The Twelve Days of Crunch Time
A poem by Gilbert and Kauzlaric
On the twelfth day of crunch time,
My project gave to me...

Twelve cents in royalties,

Eleven kiss-ass previews,

Ten nerdy testers,

Nine patent lawsuits,

Eight unplanned for features,

Seven frames a second,

Six angry spouses,

Five focus groups!

Four unstable hacks,

Three days without sleep,

Two surly artists,

and a crappy publishing deal.]]></summary>

Poirot was staple TV viewing when I was a teenage so the image of the character is burned well into my consciousness (thank you David Suchet) - so reading an Agatha Christie book tends to come with very easy imagination and even accents for characters.
The story is well built, told in a way that makes me think I should have been able to deduce the killer myself (and something I've always wondered about murder mystery stories) and does a good job of flipping my expectations on its head!

line from an older post of mine that had been making the rounds.  In it, 
I say something about adding a number to "my list of magic numbers".  
That person wanted to see that list.


And so, I have put together this list of everything I can think of at 
the moment, along with a whole bunch of commentary that should be able 
to send you on dozens of romps through Wikipedia.  Hopefully this will 
both satisfy the request for "the list" and provide a lot of amusement 
on a day which normally is lacking in content.


Be safe out there, and enjoy.
