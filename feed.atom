Now, people are getting answers from Siri, Google search snippets, and mobile apps, not just our websites. Forward-thinking organizations have adopted an omnichannel content strategy, whose mission is to reach audiences across multiple digital channels and platforms.
But how do you set up a content management system (CMS) to reach your audience now and in the future? I learned the hard way that creating a content model—a definition of content types, attributes, and relationships that let people and systems understand content—with my more familiar design-system thinking would capsize my customer’s omnichannel content strategy. You can avoid that outcome by creating content models that are semantic and that also connect related content.…]]></summary>

On a Wednesday night not so long ago, someone opened a SEV (that is, a

their service were "crash looping".  These things ran in an environment

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2008, Mark Changizi, a Sloan-Swartz Fellow in Theoretical Neuroscience at Caltech, noted that the eye can make sense of complex relationships that often mystify the brain. 


Our everyday visual perceptions rely upon unfathomably complex computations carried out by tens of billions of neurons across over half our cortex. In spite of this, it does not “feel” like work to see. Our cognitive powers are, in stark contrast, “slow and painful,” and we have great trouble with embarrassingly simple logic tasks. 

Might it be possible to harness our visual computational powers for other tasks, perhaps for tasks cognition finds difficult? 


In other words, could we trick the eye into performing computation? 

Changizi proposed the Escher Circuit, "a special kind of image that amounts to 'visual software' our 'visual hardware' computes" merely through perception.

Escher Circuits work by creating different states corresponding to how the eye resolves ambiguous images. Its core component, the wire, holds a state of 0 when we perceive it as if we are to the right of it; otherwise, it holds a state of 1.

hangs around for testing random junk.  It's still getting updates, and 
so when Apple offered it iOS 15 today, I installed it.  This gave me a 
chance to turn on their beta "private relay" stuff which seems to be 
a TOR-like system.


What did surprise me is the lack of "stickiness" for these IP addresses.  
Every five seconds or so, it seems to hop to another address in the same 
(IPv6, remember) /64.  If you're not down with v6 conventions yet, this 
means the first four parts like "xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx" stay the same, but 
the last four change completely every time.


I actually don't have any v4-only (aka LEGACY) stuff to try it on, so I 
have no idea what happens on that side of the world.  It probably looks 
about the same, albeit within a much smaller range of possible source IP 
addresses.  It probably resembles a CGNAT type situation.

It'll be fun to see what this breaks, and who howls the loudest.]]></summary>

Just the image from this post was enough to make it click in my head 👍


VOLTAGE is like the pressure that pushes water through the hose. It is measured in volts (V).


CURRENT is like the diameter of the hose. The wider it is, the more water will flow through. It is measured in amps (I or A).


RESISTANCE is like sand in the hose that slows down the water flow. It is measured in ohms (R or Ω).

and I mentioned that I really like debugging using a REPL. He said he’d never
tried it and that it sounded fun, so I thought I’d write a quick post about it.
This debugging method doesn’t work in a lot of languages, but it does work in
Python and Ruby and kiiiiiind of in C (via gdb).
what’s a REPL?
REPL stands for “read eval print loop”. A REPL is a program that:
reads some input from you like print(f"2 + 2 = {2+2}") (read)
evaluates the input (eval)
print out the result (print)
and then goes back to step 1 (loop)
Here’s an example of me using the IPython REPL to run a print statement. (also
it demonstrates f-strings, my favourite Python 3 feature)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s been a recent discussion on Twitter about the idea of adding a new element in HTML that represents a search interface. A search form, basically.
The idea is to create a semantic HTML element for the ARIA search role, which represents a landmark region “that contains a collection of items and objects that, as a whole, combine to create a search facility.”
Opinions have been shared in the Twitter thread about whether adding a new HTML element is necessary. Many have argued that it was unnecessary because we can use the ARIA search role and repurpose a form element to create the same semantics. I disagree. And this article is the longer version of my personal opinion on the subject.

interview and trying to learn some algorithms basics.
The topic of quadratic-time vs linear-time algorithms came up, I thought this
would be fun to write about here because avoiding quadratic-time algorithms
isn’t just important in interviews – it’s sometimes good to know about in real
life too! I’ll explain what a “quadratic-time algorithm is” in a minute :)
here are the 3 things we’ll talk about:
quadratic time functions are WAY WAY WAY slower than linear time functions
sometimes you can make a quadratic algorithm into a linear algorithm by using a hashmap
this is because hashmaps lookups are very fast (instant!)
I’m going to try to keep the math jargon to a minimum and focus on real code
examples and how fast/…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wrote this a couple of years ago in another context, but it looks like 
it's still just as applicable today, so I decided to bring it out from 
behind the permission curtain.  This originally was only visible to 
coworkers who happened to look at my feed.  Now it isn't.


Code runs on people.  Please keep it simple.


You can throw all kinds of wicked, nasty, complicated, 
Klein-bottle-wannabe tricks into code and the computer will shrug and 
slog on through it.


Nobody will ever have more state about the code than the original author 
at the time of creation.  Everything after that pales in comparison.  If 
it takes an hour to figure out what's going on, well, that's an hour 
that wasn't spent doing something else more useful and interesting.


We get it, you're clever.  But the business doesn't need clever. It 
needs code that is only as complicated as absolutely necessary to get 
the job done.  Anything else is just wasted effort.


If a problem calls for clever, okay, then have at it.  But I bet it 
doesn't.  Most things really don't. Be honest with yourself, and with 
your future coworkers.  It makes for a healthier environment. 


I think this was originally written as an indirect response to some 
"clever-wielding" that had been witnessed on one of my tours of duty in 
some infrastructure team.  It's not clear that it had any positive 
effect, though.  These things are hard to measure after the fact, 
particularly once the "look how high I can pile up the clever" culture 
has infected a team thoroughly and it starts being rewarded.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone! This is the list of all the changes we've done to our projects and apps during the month of August. We'll also be reporting in our on position in the world, and on our future plans.
Summary Of Changes
Nasu, implemented a way to shift multiple tiles at once, and added a snarf buffer to copy/paste data between instances of Nasu.
Niju, completed, and released the project on itch.io.
Orca, implemented snarf buffer to easily bring patches in and out of it (uxn version).
Uxn, massive re-write of the Uxn VM, and CollapseOS now runs on Uxn.
Paradise, started on a Uxn-native version.
noodle, created a mascot, and added a tiny animation toolkit.
    
100r.co, added various hand drawn images to the knowledge base.
News
This month, our little engine was fixed (read about it here) we've been sailing around the Gulf Islands, working from anchor. We also found Iggy's successor, a used fiberglass dinghy that we've named Teapot. We've been rowing it from ship to shore, and it's so, so nice. We stopped by Saltspring Island and got to meet the sailors on BosunBird, a couple who have traveled around the world on a Vancouver27. Their blog was an invaluable resource for us on our travels through Japan. 
We've released a solid version of noodle, our drawing tool. Follow the tutorial on our website, or check out this amazing quick start guide by Polyducks. We also released niju, our little kana-learning game. Niju was a trial to see if we could design, write and assemble a project entirely within the Uxn computer.
Our friends at Compudanzas have released part 3, 4 and 5 of their Introduction to Uxn Programming tutorial.
Pino book club
Help. We still haven't finished The Swarm by Frank Schatzing. It is terrible, but we can't stop.

I bet there was something that came up in the meeting where I said 
something like "you should be able to talk to our server right now but 
give it a try and let us know if you can't".  This meant that our RPC 
definitions were checked into source control like you'd expect, our

But we don't expect a commercial enterprise to suddenly discover a package they have long relied on forbids any use at all—and does so for a very good reason.

This was the realization for dapr, a “portable, serverless, event-driven runtime,” with 14k stars on GitHub, when an issue was opened last week about its dependency bouk/monkey. Monkey's license, in its entirety, reads:


I do not give anyone permissions to use this tool for any purpose. Don’t use it.

I’m not interested in changing this license. Please don’t ask.


It raises the question: do even corporate entities read the licenses of packages they use? While Dapr was called out, Arduino, SalesForce, and hundreds of other projects also reference Monkey.

Great stuff. It also brings in some of the end of book 4 - All The Rage into a larger storyline.
The writing is certainly formulaic to some degree, but that's not particularly a bad thing and having familiarity with the characters, for me having read all the DI Adam Fawley series, means I can follow along at a much more interesting pace through the book.
I suspect this is classic "beach reading" if I were the type. I've enjoyed every one of Hunter's books I've read so far and I'll be pre-ordering the sixth installment: and easy choice.]]></summary>

organically, and we eventually realized we needed a "dashboard" of 
sorts.  That is, we wanted an internally-hosted page that would let 
anyone load it up and see what was going on with the service.  It was 
intended to be simple: ping our server, ask for the status, and then 
render the response into a simple list.  Later on, we knew we were going 
to want to add the ability to send a "panic" signal to our server from 
this page, so that anyone in the company could hit the "big red button" 
if things went haywire.


January 1: we put up a terrible hack: a shell script that runs a 
Python script that talks to the service to get the status and then 
dumps out raw HTML to a file in someone's public_html path.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Antiracist economist Kim Crayton says that “intention without strategy is chaos.” We’ve discussed how our biases, assumptions, and inattention toward marginalized and vulnerable groups lead to dangerous and unethical tech—but what, specifically, do we need to do to fix it? The intention to make our tech safer is not enough; we need a strategy.
This chapter will equip you with that plan of action. It covers how to integrate safety principles into your design work in order to create tech that’s safe, how to convince your stakeholders that this work is necessary, and how to respond to the critique that what we actually need is more diversity. (Spoiler: we do, but diversity alone is not the antidote to fixing unethical, unsafe tech.)

I guess the story is about finding strength when pushed to your limits, but I'm no English scholar so I could have totally missed the point!Buck is certainly heroic (or perhaps stoic) in the face of insurmountable hardship, and perhaps this is representative of the times that London lived in?What amazed me was, apparently, the Kindle version of the book is 45 pages - and it took me a week to read - either my page numbers are wrong or I stumbled through this book!!!]]></summary>

written about a certain topic.  I went looking through the now-decade of

sure, the word itself comes up, but that's when talking about padding 
out meeting times, jamming a C-64 into a suitcase, or sticking spaces 
or zeroes in front of some number.


For me, it goes something like this: if things are generally okay in my 
life, then I start the day with some amount of padding.  If something 
happens, that impacts the padding.  If there's enough padding, it ends 
up being a mild inconvenience at worst.  For instance, this time last

This was far enough back in time to where we all still had desk

was definitely there for the first couple of years.

expect you to load a crapload of apps on to do your job.


It also meant that I could put it away at the end of the day and all 
work-related stuff would stay out of sight and out of mind until the 
next morning.


So, overall, I was surprised when it started being really belligerent

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! Recently I’ve been thinking about why I explain things the way I do. The
usual way I write is:
Try to learn a topic
Read a bunch of explanations that I find confusing
Eventually understand the topic
Write an explanation that makes sense to me, to help others
So why do I find all these explanations so confusing? I decided to try and find
out! I came up with a list of 12 patterns that make explanations hard for me to
understand. For each pattern I’ll also explain what I like to do instead to
avoid the issue.
these patterns are very normal
This list isn’t meant to make you feel bad about your writing. I’ve probably
done all of these things! I’m certainly going to do them again! I even did at
least one of them while writing this post!
But knowing that I’m likely to accidently do these t…]]></summary>

after initially seeing tons of crazy Russian insurance scams thwarted by 
it, and then a bunch of crazy videos from the rest of the world, it was 
my turn.  Then, over the weekend, it finally paid off by capturing video 
of something awful that happened to me.


My assumption is that the Phoenix-Vegas traffic makes things really 
crappy, hence the added enforcement and whatnot.  I figured, okay, I'll 
set the cruise control exactly at the 75 mph limit and just leave it 
there until I'm well past this area.  At least it's going to be 
well-maintained, well-lit, and all of that, right?  Safety corridor?
Surely that means they also maintain it better, since they enforce much 
more strenuously?

The language Yorlang began like many code projects, with a group of programmers contemplating a what-if.


One evening after work, i was scrolling through the messages in a group chat that i'm in and i read a message by someone talking about how cool it will be to have a programming language in yoruba that can process the command "sope 'hello world' ". So, i thought it was cool and i decided to create a very small language.


With that modest intention in mind, Karounwi Anoulowapo (based in Nigeria) created Yorlang, a JS-like language using keywords drawn from Yoruba. As colleagues requested more features, he kept expanding it until it became a full-fledged language. Other Yoruba-speaking programmers contributed, along with some non-speakers who were excited about a programming language created by and for West Africans.


One of the major contributors to the projects is a guy from the Igbo tribe. He documented the architecture of the code, contributed helper functions to the language, and also made small sample programs using yorlang.

reviewed some incident where something bad happened involving something 
that ran as root.  I don't remember the finer points of that one any 
more, but the resident VP who ran the show wondered aloud how much 
"root exposure" we had in our infra in general.  That got my attention.


After the meeting ended without using the whole 90 minutes, the room was 
still reserved for another 15-20 minutes or so, and a couple of people 
hung out to look at the list.  One noticed that this one service 
running everywhere had these options for "pre" and "post" commands.  
This was a service which was normally used for performance measurement 
stuff and involved running an external command.  You'd say "okay,

or other.  The other one ("service") managed the team that ran the 
gunk that let people ask for machines with GPUs so they can run stuff.  
What happened is that "service" presented it as "user screwed up and 
was down because of some stuff that happened".


It turned out to be a completely different story than the one they were

Access All Areas (or aaa) is a new online conference—part of a series of focussed conferences created by the folks at Web Directions. This conference is focussed on accessibility for developers: understanding the different kinds of accessibility issues that our code may create, finding those issues using available auditing and testing tools, as well as techniques and technologies for addressing them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone! This is the list of all the changes we've done to our projects and apps during the month of July. We'll also be reporting in our on position in the world, and on our future plans.
Summary Of Changes
Nasu, implemented the export of .theme files, and theme support.

News
This month, Calcifer is being re-built. While we wait for that, we're working on more projects aboard. We added insulation to the v-berth, an attempt to keep Pino warm this winter. We created a new portal called boat projects on our wiki that covers most of the major construction projects we've done to the boat.
Our friends at Compudanzas have started writing an Introduction to Uxn Programming tutorial. We recommend it to anyone interested in programming for the Uxn Computer. No prior understanding of stack-machines, or Assembly, required! The first covers basics, and the latest chapter focuses on learning to draw pixels on the screen.
If you missed Devine's performance at Flash Crash, you can watch it here.
Pino book club
We're reading Mingming & the Art of Minimal Ocean Sailing by Roger Taylor and The Swarm by Frank Schatzing.

Whether to convey information, conduct transactions, or simply to check in on one another, people have yammered away, chattering and gesticulating, through spoken conversation for countless generations. Only in the last few millennia have we begun to commit our conversations to writing, and only in the last few decades have we begun to outsource them to the computer, a machine that shows much more affinity for written correspondence than for the slangy vagaries of spoken language.
Computers have trouble because between spoken and written language, speech is more primordial. To have successful conversations with us, machines must grapple with the messiness of human speech: the disfluencies and pauses, the gestures and body language, an…]]></summary>

We learned tons doing it, and now our toilet is perfectly suited to our space. The pandemic has pushed more people into boat and van living (to travel within their own countries) and towards simple systems. Looking at the Nature's Head website, they've had a 8-week waiting list for ages. It's either you wait for the thing, or you build the thing.
Dry toilets are simple to use and have few parts, but it doesn't mean that they are simple to build. Simple is hard, it costs time, and requires a ton of creativity.
