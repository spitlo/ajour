        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been having a hard time understanding IPv6. On one hand, the basics initially seem pretty
straightforward (there aren’t enough IPv4 addresses for all the devices on the
internet, so people invented IPv6! There are enough IPv6 addresses for
everyone!)
But when I try to actually understand it, I run into a lot of questions. One
question is: twitter.com does not support IPv6. Presumably it can’t be causing
them THAT many issues to not support it. So why do websites support IPv6?
I asked people on Twitter why their servers support IPv6
and I got a lot of great answers, which I’ll summarize here. These all come
with the disclaimer that I have basically 0 experience with IPv6 so I can’t evaluate these reasons very well.
First though, I want to explain why it’s possible for twitter.com to no…]]></summary>

what you're looking at here.




I do remember the description from the back: this is a picture of *part 
of* something that was called the Software Creations BBS.  It was a 
multi-line bulletin board system where you could dial up and send 
messages to people, upload and download files, and (presumably) play 
online games ("doors") and anything else they cared to offer.

64 machines in a little space.  I have to assume 
they are at least 
286s (ATs, more or 
less), but it's impossible to tell from just this picture.  They could 
have been 386s or even 486s by that point, but …]]></summary>

a picture of an old multi-line bulletin board system which had

two cents, and so here we go.


Or, were you someone who found it horrific and wished there was a 
simpler way?  Did you wonder if it would be possible to pack all of that 
into one or maybe two boxes, instead?  Did you want a way to negate all 
of that complexity while still providing the same level of service?


Now, things are different.  I look at that and just sigh at the lost

Everything in here is pretty standard but I wanted to write down what I did
anyway because there are a surprising number of decisions and I like to see

complicated. Like, there are DNS records, they’re stored on a server, what’s
the big deal?
But with DNS, reading about how it works in a textbook doesn’t prepare you for
the sheer volume of different ways DNS can break your system in practice. It’s
not just caching problems!
So I asked people on Twitter for
example of DNS problems they’ve run into, especially DNS problems that didn’t
initially appear to be DNS problems. (the popular “it’s always DNS” meme)
I’m not going to discuss how to solve or avoid any of these problems in this
post, but I’ve linked to webpages discussing the problem where I could find
them.

I’m writing this because if you made a DNS update and it didn’t work, there are 2 options:
Your authoritative nameserver doesn’t have the correct record
Your authoritative nameserver does have the correct record, but an old record is cached and you need to wait for the cache to expire
To be able to tell which one is happening (do you need to make a change, or do
you just need to wait?), you need to be able to find your domain’s
authoritative nameserver and query it to see what records it has.
But when I looked up “how to find a domain’s authoritative nameserver” to see
what advice was out there, I found a lot of different methods being mentioned,

decentralized. There are thousands (maybe hundreds of thousands? I don’t know!) of authoritative nameservers, and at least
10 million resolvers.
And they’re running lots of different software! All these different servers
running software means that there’s a lot of inconsistency in how DNS works,
which can cause all kinds of frustrating problems.
But instead of talking about the problems, I’m interested in figuring out –
why is it a good thing that DNS is decentralized?

One reason is scalability – the decentralized design of DNS makes it

sometimes.  Here's another one I just heard about, and it's directly 
related to what just happened with the calendar.


The last value for last year is December 31, 2021 at 23:59, and in this 
format it becomes 2112312359.  That just fits into a signed 32 bit 
number (which tops out at 2147483647).


So, if you're using Microsoft Exchange and stopped getting your mail in 
the past couple of hours, this is why!

Really!  No joke!

For example, I read Call of the Wild, an 80(ish) page book in 4 weeks and then I read a 400 page book in 4 days… so it's really swings and roundabouts.
I recorded 21 books on my Kindle this year, but actually one of them was read aloud to the kids (Which I do still count) but another one was all of 19 pages… which, I think really doesn't count (it was Home: Habitat, Range, Niche, Territory by Martha Wells). So… 20 books then.

I think the two hardest things about working for myself are working alone and

This year I spent some time trying to figure out what I’m doing with wizard

some feelings about what’s important, and even though following my feelings
usually turns out well, I can’t always explain what I’m trying to do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lovely but I found the language almost too distracting.
Only right at the end of the book did I consider that maybe I really wasn't the right audience for the story - as it seemed to smack of "millennium type problems". Using air quotes in my description because I'm fairly sure this is a patronising statement I'm making!
The Dex character feels discontent with their achievements and is struggling to find fulfilling meaning. Their work has meaning to others but they're left feeling empty. Obviously it's an impossible measure as life trondles forward and achievements change with time.
For me it was only really when Dex meets the Robot (whose name I've already forgotten) when the book became more engaging. It was like the Dex character could be challenged and some real depth was offered (for better or worse for Dex's personality).
But what I did struggle with was the language and the odd shoehorning of gender pronouns. Dex is neither "he" or "she", so Chamber's settles with using the "they" pronoun. This led to my own confusion regularly thinking the lines I was reading was referring to Dex and another character that was in the scene.
The sore-thumb moment is when Dex asks, interestingly, what pronoun the Robot uses, and the Robot responds with "it" and it refers to itself as an object. Dex replies with (something like) they are the same, and their pronoun is "they". This seemed like a potentially interesting exchange between the Robot and Dex about the subject of how one refers to oneself and how they identify, but it doesn't happen. It just has that exchange, and then the story returns to what they were doing and carries on. It felt jarring and like Chamber's wanted to discuss this topic, but instead shoe horned it in.
I do also suspect that my trouble with the language is a me-thing and probably with practice it won't cause me as much (or any) confusion, but for now, and this book, it definitely affected how I enjoyed the story.]]></summary>

working on a project with some friends.  By virtue of being in a very 
large company, we had quite the assortment of libraries which could be

looking for a matching feature, and it turned into a security dumpster

It won't work.  You have to start from the top and work your way down.  
The ones which already exist will probably fail with -EEXIST, so 
sometimes it makes more sense to look at what's there, work your way

Clayton and I did this back in Dec of 2004.  Interesting how much hasn't changed. I'd have more "male" spouses now, something about loot crates and IAP, kissing up to steamers, and maybe change the last verse to be more "indie", but its shockingly accurate years later.
The Twelve Days of Crunch Time
A poem by Gilbert and Kauzlaric
On the twelfth day of crunch time,
My project gave to me...

Twelve cents in royalties,

Eleven kiss-ass previews,

Ten nerdy testers,

Nine patent lawsuits,

Eight unplanned for features,

Seven frames a second,

Six angry spouses,

Five focus groups!

Four unstable hacks,

Three days without sleep,

Two surly artists,

and a crappy publishing deal.]]></summary>

Poirot was staple TV viewing when I was a teenage so the image of the character is burned well into my consciousness (thank you David Suchet) - so reading an Agatha Christie book tends to come with very easy imagination and even accents for characters.
The story is well built, told in a way that makes me think I should have been able to deduce the killer myself (and something I've always wondered about murder mystery stories) and does a good job of flipping my expectations on its head!
Solid stuff.]]></summary>

If you just want to see the cartridge in action or want to get into all the details, I highly recommend to watch the video first as it goes through the difficulties and their respective solutions.

I like to learn in a very hands-on way. And so when I write a zine, I often
close the zine by saying something like “… and the best way to learn more
about this is to play around and experiment!“.
So I built a site where you can do experiments with DNS called Mess With DNS. It has examples of experiments you can try, and
you’ve very encouraged to come up with your own experiments.
In this post I’ll talk about why I made this, how it works, and give you
probably more details than you want to know about how I built it (design, testing,
security, writing an authoritative nameserver, live streaming updates, etc)

I feel like the term "DNS propagation" is misleading, like you're not actually waiting for DNS records to "propagate", you're waiting for cached records to expire

and I want to talk about it a little more. This came up because I was showing a
friend a demo of how DNS caching works last week, and he realized that what was
happening in the demo didn’t line up with his mental model of how DNS worked.
He immediately brought this up and adjusted his mental model (“oh, DNS records are
pulled, not pushed!“). But this it got me thinking – why did my very
smart and experienced friend have an inaccurate mental model for how DNS works
in the first place?

how to use dig to make DNS queries, so here’s a quick blog post about it.
When I first started using dig I found it a bit intimidating – there are so
many options! I’m going to leave out most of dig’s options in this post and just
talk about the ones I actually use.
Also I learned recently that you can set up a .digrc configuration file to make its output
easier to read and it makes it SO MUCH nicer to use.
I also drew a zine page about dig a few years ago, but I wanted to write this post to include a bit more information.

line from an older post of mine that had been making the rounds.  In it, 
I say something about adding a number to "my list of magic numbers".  
That person wanted to see that list.


And so, I have put together this list of everything I can think of at 
the moment, along with a whole bunch of commentary that should be able 
to send you on dozens of romps through Wikipedia.  Hopefully this will 
both satisfy the request for "the list" and provide a lot of amusement 
on a day which normally is lacking in content.


Be safe out there, and enjoy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've told some stories about what happens when you end up at a company 
that builds nothing and instead rents everything from some vendor.  
Given that, it's only fair that I describe something bad that can 
happen at a company which is known for building stuff.


The trouble is that sometimes these companies will hire someone who's 
known for doing X... and *only* X.  They're a builder, all right, as 
long as you want them to build X.  Perhaps they have been building X at 
some other company, and now your company has hired them to come and do 
that same job over here instead.


There's also the possibility that the prestige of having this person 
working at the company is what they're actually cultivating, and 
management wants to make this person happy by letting them work on their 
pet project, even if the pet project itself is not doing anything 
positive.

actually belongs in 
production.  In one outcome, it's brilliantly executed and things grow.  
But, this is about the downsides, and in that scenario, it's a stinking 
pile of garbage and needs to be thrown out, but it gets forced in, 
anyway.


If this project is being pushed for political reasons, then it should 
not come as a surprise that when it finally does ship to production,
it causes outages and generally fails to deliver on its promises.  It's 
actually worse than just leaving things the way they had been before any 
of this stuff showed up.


Just imagine what companies would look like if their hiring processes 
filtered out this kind of charlatan instead of looking for whether they 
could do some dumb coding card trick in a 45 minute interview block.
I think they'd look very different, and a whole bunch of people would 
have to find another industry to prey upon.]]></summary>
