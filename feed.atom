The only (big) problem I run into is that the solution offered is to use "docker secrets" which, for the vast majority of my own work isn't something that's available (I don't use docker for my development or deployments).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the double-edged swords about having done some of this work for a 
while is that I have a bunch of random things that I take for granted.  
These are mostly just bits of data and other knowledge that I picked up 
a long time ago and don't even talk about any more.  This is actually a 
bad thing in certain situations, since everyone comes from a slightly 
different place in terms of what they know and do and their 
specialties.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The HTML <hr> element adds a horizontal rule (or line) wherever you place it. A horizontal rule is used to provide a visual break and divide content. Like other HTML elements, horizontal rules can be styled using CSS (and SVG). This means that they don’t have to look like boring, plain horizontal lines. You can get a little creative with them, adding a nice little personal touch to your content and designs.
If you’re a frequent reader of this blog, then you’ve most likely already seen what a horizontal rule…]]></summary>

I've been doing code reviews since the early 2000s. It's taken me some twenty years to finally articulate that they're not that useful - or certainly not useful in the form I've seen them in the first two decades of my career.]]></summary>

What's nice about Marbles is that because the game is so familiar to me, it let's me spend time experimenting in areas that are typically out of reach.
The bulk of the work I've done over the last few months has been all in assembly. The performance of the logic and maths work in NextBASIC was too slow, so I moved it all into a machine code library that I can call from NextBASIC.
I was able to use the excellent…]]></summary>

Remembering my project where I used my old Sony Alpha NEX-5T for 3d printing timelapses, I decided to set up a photo trap based on the Wifi remote feature of this camera and it worked perfectly:

With LAYER 1,1:

To make use of the fuller colour set, you need to enable "Enhanced ULA functionality" which is achieved using the PALETTE FORMAT n routine.
The PALETTE FORMAT n value is allowed 255, 127, 63, 31, 15, 7, 3, 1 and 0. The pattern here is 255 shifted right.
To then select a colour for the layer, the LAYER PALETTE 0, i, v routine is used (or a palette can be loaded with LAYER PALETTE 0 BANK n,…]]></summary>
