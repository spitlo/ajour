          "description": "The game went live just under a week ago and the feedback has been really nice to see.\nThere's been a balance of \"regular\" players and power players, and in those power players is where the game got some more much needed play testing.\nThe one thing that I had designed into the game was the unlimited undo. The side effect was that, technically, there's infinite ability to make your way through the game so long as you had time and patience - a lot of patience!\nThe knock on problem with infinite moves is that the score really isn't infinite. In fact, I alluded to that in a previous devlog because the score is a 16bit value, it has a max range.\nSo with that, this new release adds a penalty to using the undo. I went through a lot of different ideas and tested them out to see how they affected the score. Here's just a few that I tried:\n\nSubtracting 100 points per undo\nHalving the score per undo\nSubtracting the number of blocks restored\nUsing the undo depth as a multiplier - as in: if you undo twice, the penalty is greater\n\nThese had either drastic effects on the score, which made it pointless, or very subtle effects which rendered the penalty ineffective.\nWhat I settled on was using your progress as the multiplier. So, undo costs 25 points per undo on level 1. On level 2, it costs 50 points, level 3 75 points and so on.\nThis changes the dynamic of the game in a really interesting way. You start to consider the impact on your decisions against your score: do I continue with undo and risk it, or do I accept the fate of stable score and hope it's good enough for a highscore?\nThere was also some fixes for the custom themes - around the palette because I require a custom palette for the game's main tiles, but when you add your own custom tiles the game switches to the default Layer 2 palette - so there were fixes around that too. And here's Gaz Mashall's own custom theme in action behind a new user interface change:",

Still, I think it's looking pretty snazzy:\n\nAll the same, the itch download page is primed and ready for release on Saturday. There's two downloads available: the game and the game with fully documented source code and PDF overview article.\nIn lieu of the release, I've been looking back at the original version I wrote in the early 2000s and found a web based Palm Pilot emulator that let me actually play and capture screenshots of the original game (I even managed to recover the source code and published it on github). So I present to you - the old version:\n\nOnce the game is live for the Spectrum I'll release the web version and if I planned the code right, we'll all be able to contribute to the high score leader board!",

This is a two part process.\n1. Capture current values from production:\nSELECT last_value FROM public.<table>_<col>_seq;\n\nSo for something like user ids, this would be:\nSELECT last_value FROM public.user_id_seq;\n>>> 304\n\nIf this doesn't yield a result, then the sequence name is wrong, and it can be checked with the following query:\nSELECT pg_get_serial_sequence('user', 'id');\n\nNow armed with this value, in my example 304, the next part is to upload locally:\n2. Update sequences locally:\nALTER SEQUENCE <table>_<col>_seq RESTART WITH <next_value>;\n\nIt's important that I update to the next value, not the current value:\nALTER SEQUENCE user_id_seq RESTART WITH 305;\n\nNow when the next id for the user is loaded through an insert, the sequences are in sync.",

If you are very lucky, someone else will find uses for it you never intended, or that even challenge the premise of the language.\n\r\nThis is not the same as using the language in an unexpected way. Urban Müller could not have foreseen brainfuck as the bedrock for a Rust-like language or a CPU. But do these projects truly counter brainfuck's premise? I would argue not. Brainfuck appears chaotic but part of its appeal has always been in conquering that chaos, in building efficient algorithms using the language despite the challenge. These projects counter the chaos of brainfuck, but that really is the appeal of brainfuck in the first place, they are simply taking it much further than could have been anticipated. If Müller had wanted brainfuck to be impossible to master, he would have designed the language much differently.\n\r\nSometimes, however, a language inspires work that falls very far from the intent of its original designer. Most esolangs, like mainstream programming languages, are open systems and don't dictate how programmers use them. C# offers many features to make structured code easy. But I can also write C# that looks like 80s BASIC wrapped in some standard C# boilerplate:\nRead More",

          "description": "We’ve been having conversations for thousands of years. Whether to convey information, conduct transactions, or simply to check in on one another, people have yammered away, chattering and gesticulating, through spoken conversation for countless generations. Only in the last few millennia have we begun to commit our conversations to writing, and only in the last few decades have we begun to outsource them to the computer, a machine that shows much more affinity for written correspondence than for the slangy vagaries of spoken language.\nComputers have trouble because between spoken and written language, speech is more primordial. To have successful conversations with us, machines must grapple with the messiness of human speech: the disfluencies and pauses, the gestures and body language, an…",

Or design products that work on devices yet to be invented?\nFlash, Photoshop, and responsive design\nWhen I first started designing websites, my go-to software was Photoshop. I created a 960px canvas and set about creating a layout that I would later drop content in. The development phase was about attaining pixel-perfect accuracy using fixed widths, fixed heights, and absolute positioning.\nEthan Marcotte’s talk at An Event Apart and subsequent article “Responsive Web Design” in A List Apart in 2010 changed all this.

          "description": "“Any comment?” is probably one of the worst ways to ask for feedback. It’s vague and open ended, and it doesn’t provide any indication of what we’re looking for. Getting good feedback starts earlier than we might expect: it starts with the request. \nIt might seem counterintuitive to start the process of receiving feedback with a question, but that makes sense if we realize that getting feedback can be thought of as a form of design research. In the same way that we wouldn’t do any research without the right questions to get the insights that we need, the best way to ask for feedback is also to craft sharp questions.\nDesign critique is not a one-shot process. Sure, any good feedback workflow continues until the project is finished, but this is particularly true for design because design wor…",

Poor feedback can create confusion in projects, bring down morale, and affect trust and team collaboration over the long term.
