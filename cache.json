We had a lovely sail that day, with clear skies, and 10 kts on the beam. Despite being a little food and sleep deprived, Devine's presentation went well, we will share the recording here once it is released.\nRek has been busy editing Wiktopher, finessing the conlangs featured in the story. One of the featured languages is Ilken, a whistled language, designed for long-distance communication, and playable with instruments. A few years ago Devine designed a language for it, but we decided to instead use a modern variation of Solresol, a musical language by Jean-François Sudre. Rek drew a fanart of the mascot of Solresol, and Devine a communication lantern.\nCurrently, Devine is working at translating Thousand Rooms(Famimi Remisolla) in Solresol as practice. We're also editing a Brazilian Portuguese version, to be released next month.\nWe've been toying with the idea of making an audiobook for the story, and asked Paul B. to use their voice synthesis tool Gesture to try and hear what a poem in Ilken(Solresol) sounds like. The result was so lovely that it made Rek cry of joy.\nRek's sketch thread(Mastodon) is still going. Devine will be producing a lot more art next month for Drawtober!\nPino book club\nWe are reading J.D. Salinger's Catcher in the Rye, and B. F. Skinner's Walden Two.\nContinue Reading",

We visited this place during a very windy week, with winds blowing 30-35 kts the entire time. We got acquainted with a few northern rapids, like Hole in the Wall and Surge Narrows. It is a bit of a mindfuck to think that in these waters the tide ebbs north and floods south.\nThis summer has been especially arid, and because of it the province has seen a lot forest fires (see pictures of our smokey transit). Trails that we know and love on Cortes Island, that are usually wet and muddy, were bone dry this year. We had a few days of hard rain, during that time we collect rain water and go for walks to  look for slugs and snails.\nBoth of us have been drawing a lot this month, see this Neoneve portrait(Mastodon) by Devine (drawn with Oekaki), and this sketch thread(Mastodon) by Rek..\nPino book club\nWe have read Adam Wisniewski-Snerg's Robot, George Orwell's Homage to Catalonia, and Michael A.

The cart was also missing a resistor and capacitor.\nI decided to start by completely removing the chips from the board, and I'm glad I did because underneath I found a lot of corrosion and junk from either time or previous attempts. The solder joints also looked dull which suggested to me that it would benefit from a reflow.\nOnce this was done, the board was cleaned (thankfully there was no trace repair required), I replaced the chips and went about grinding the ROM chip to expose the broken leg.\n\nOnce exposed, I created a jumper using solder to the pad, installed a few missing components (a capacitor and resistor had been lost previously) and it was all back to life.",

          "description": "Cutting to the chase: text editors *and* tabs vs. spaces!  Ooooh!\n\n\nI've had this thing called \"e\" for a while now.  It's a stupid little \nscript which serves to do a couple of things.  It starts my \neditor\nwith a given file, and it kicks it with the right arguments to make it \ndisable line wrapping and to make the [TAB] key actually put in two \nspaces.\n\n\nSo, my dumb script would use \"-w -E -T 2\" most of the time, except when it \nwas running on a Makefile, at which point it would skip those args.  \nSimple enough, right?\n\n\npico is back?  Yes indeed, on Macs, as of 12.3, pico is in fact back.  To \nmake sure I wasn't imagining things, I tracked down a machine that hadn't \nbeen upgraded yet and checked there.  Sure enough, it was in fact nano and \nnot pico.\n\n\nmacOS 12.3 has nano as a symlink... pointing to pico!\n\n\nAt some point, I switched from literal tab characters in my source code to \nblobs of spaces, probably due to using that style at work and not hating \nit.  So, somewhere along the line I actually started depending on nano \nbehavior without realizing it.\n\n\nAs for the lack of a feature in pico itself, it's kind of strange, really.  \nIf you go digging into the source, they have this random.c with a function \ncalled tab which claims to \"simulate tab stop\" using spaces.  That said, I \ncan't find any place where it would be called with the magic values which \nwould make it behave that way.\n\n\nIt wouldn't surprise me if this switch is just more of Apple removing \nGPLed things from their OS - pico seems to use the Apache license.  They \ndumped bash for zsh (MIT license) at some point (Big Sur, I think), and \nnow this?  Okay then.",

          "description": "Here's a very old and stupid trick you could do with some filesystems in \nsome situations back in the day... and might still be able to do in a \nfew places today.\n\n\nThe problem is that while version X might eventually have an exploit, \nit'll get removed and it'll be replaced by version Y without that\nparticular hole.  By the time you get your hands on a tool to break into \nX, it'll be gone.\n\n\nWhat you'd do is create a hard link pointing at the file you wanted to \npreserve, storing it in a spot which was writable by your account.  \nThen, say, /usr/bin/sudo (because that never has security \nissues...) gets replaced at some point with a new file and you get to \nkeep the old version.  When you get the tool to pop it, off you go!\n\n\nOf course, these days, it's not quite so easy on the more modern systems \nyou find.  Debian 11 here won't let me do it - it's EPERM city.  Rocky 8 \n(so CentOS 8 and RHEL 8 too) also won't do it.  They both have some gunk\nin /usr/lib/sysctl.d to lock this down.  But, my old Slackware 14.2 \ninstall of my workstation let me do it the last time I tried about \na year ago.  How about that, huh?  I bet it'd still work if I dug out \nthe old drives and booted them up.\n\n\nIncidentally, this is the magic sauce: /proc/sys/fs/protected_hardlinks\nRead the man page for proc(5) to learn more about it.\n\nhere it is,\nthe thread I read a long time ago.  It's interesting to note that as far \nas I can tell, nothing actually changed upstream.  This left paranoid \nadmins like me with no option but to use the (most excellent) Openwall \npatches to lock down this kind of stuff.  I used that on my machines at \nwork which had non-staff users... just in case.\n\n\nThis whole situation is scary.  \nRead more about it.",

          "description": "One of the fun things I used to do at a prior job was to dig through the \nraw data points which were collected from the *many* servers we had.  I \ncould just pick an interesting-sounding metric and then would just ask \nthe system to show me the top 10 or bottom 10 out of a population of \nthousands or more.\n\n\nTo get my feet wet with the whole \"investigations\" thing that we'd do, I \nstarted looking into this one day and chose one of the many temp sensors \nwhich were being logged by the servers.  I forget exactly which one it \nwas, for there were many.  The CPUs logged it, the chassis logged it, \nthe power supply logged it, and so on.  There were so many choices.\n\n\nI went looking for a reason.  What could possibly explain this?  First \noff, it didn't line up with any obvious pattern in the host names.  The \nhosts were named for whichever team owned them, followed by a sequence \nnumber that was bumped any time a new one was provisioned.  There was no \nsignal to be found in that.\n\n\nThere was more, though.  You could also see a \"rack position\" in this \ndata, and now it started getting interesting.  It seems that all of the \nreally hot machines had a rack position of something low, like 04 or 05, \nand never anything higher than that.  In fact, when looking at a whole \nrack, it was always the lowest number of all of the positions that were \nbeing used.  Now this was worth chasing!\n\n\nIt's good that I asked, since they told me something surprising: \nposition 04 or 05 or whatever was the *bottom* of the rack.  Yes, \nsomehow, the lowest machine in the rack was the hottest!  They found \nthis interesting, too, and wound up digging into it.  Given that I was \nfar away in a distant office, this was the best way for us to proceed.\n\n\nThe problem was that the bottommost server would have nothing below it \nbut just open space until it got to the floor.  That space would not \nmove air efficiently, and it obviously mattered.\n\n\nThis rolled out and my hot spots disappeared.  Fantastic!",

In short, it looks like every Raspberry Pi filesystem installed \nfrom any given release image probably ends up with the same\nUUID.\n\n\nFor instance, if you downloaded the \"lite\" version of Raspbian between \nroughly November 8th and January 28th, you probably got a file called \n2021-10-30-raspios-bullseye-armhf-lite.zip.  Inside, there's an image, \nand the idea is that you dump that straight to your SD card, cram it in \nthe Pi, and off you go.  The second partition on that image is an ext4 \nfilesystem which was created on some build machine somewhere.  The UUID \non it never gets \"evolved\" to something else after the install.\n\n\nYou can see it inside the image itself here:\n\n\nOr, if you actually installed a few of these things like I did over the \npast couple of months, you can just 'tune2fs -l /dev/mmcblk0p2' and see \nthe same value in there.\n\n\nDon't end up with a pile of SD cards on your desk and think \"I know, \nI'll use the filesystem UUIDs to track which one goes where\", in other \nwords.\n\n\nIf it's not breaking anything for you, it's probably best to just let it \nbe.  Untangling a boot mess on these weird little boxes is anything but \nfun.\n\nNote: if you're actually on a recent Raspberry Pi, odds are good that \nyour /etc/fstab will be using *partition* UUIDs (PARTUUID=...) and not \nthose of the filesystem.  If in doubt, use blkid to see what's what.",

The House of the Future will bring the Human Power Plant’s “Human Powered Neighbourhood” scenario to life in Bospolder-Tussendijken, Rotterdam, in the coming years. You can already get a taste of it at the Museum Boijmans van Beuningen’s online exhibition (in Dutch).\nSince this community will run largely on human power, we need human power plants. Therefore, Kris De Decker and Marie Verdeil organise an open and collaborative workshop where we will build a fully working bicycle generator based on a second-hand spinning bike. You are welcome to learn, experiment, teach, and help.\nDuring the workshop, we will mount a generator on the bike, build a control panel, and modify devices to run on low voltage. This bicycle generator will be specifically designed to serve as a power source in the communal workshop, so that we can use it to build more stuff we need (including more bike generators).\nProgramme:\nTuesday 10 October (14h-18h): open day House of the Future\nWednesday 11 October (15h-17h): introduction workshop\nThursday 12 October (10h-17h): workshop\nFriday, October 13 (14h-19h): workshop\nSaturday, October 14 (14h-17h): workshop\nWe speak Dutch, English, French, and Spanish. The introduction (11 oct) will be in Dutch only.\nAdmission is free. To participate: just walk in (Jan Kobellstraat 56A, Rotterdam) or send an email to contact [] huisvandetoekomst [] org.\nAll future events will be published on our events page.\n\n\n Illustration: Future vision of the human powered housing block in Rotterdam.

However, our transport networks are very wasteful of energy and utterly dependent on fossil fuels. In this series of articles, Low-tech Magazine critically examines the call for electrified vehicles, which depend on unsustainable batteries and infrastructures.\nMuch more important than the chosen power source is vehicle design: size, weight, speed, acceleration, and comfort level. Furthermore, public transport is more resource efficient, and we could electrify it without batteries.\nThe book’s second part deals with long-distance transportation: planes, trains, sailing ships, and ocean liners. By placing transportation technology in a historical context, Low-tech Magazine challenges our high-tech approach to sustainability and highlights the possibilities of alternative solutions.\nContents table:\nHow to Downsize a Transport Network: the Chinese Wheelbarrow\nThe Citroën 2CV: Cleantech from the 1940s\nThe Status Quo of Electric Cars: Better Batteries, Same Range\nElectric Velomobiles: as Fast and Comfortable as Automobiles, but 80 times more Efficient\nGet Wired again: Trolleybuses and Trolleytrucks\nHigh Speed Trains are Killing the European Railway Network\nLife Without Airplanes: from London to New York in 3 Days and 12 Hours\nHow to Design a Sailing Ship for the 21st Century?\nHow to downsize a transport network?, Kris De Decker, 166 pages, Low-tech Magazine, 2023.\nOther thematic books in the series:\nHow to build a low-tech internet?, Kris De Decker, 162 pages, Low-tech Magazine, 2023.\nThe Low-tech Magazine archives are also available as a chronological series consisting of three volumes.\nPatrons get early access to new books at a reduced price.",

          "description": "Image: a laptop running on direct solar power. Photo: Marie Verdeil. \n\n\n\nConventional solar installations do not question our dependence on fossil fuels and the energy-guzzling lifestyle that results. Both rooftop solar panels and large-scale solar farms provide us with all the power we want, even when the sun is not shining. That is because these systems use the central power grid, which largely runs on fossil fuels, as a kind of battery to cope with power shortages.\nAlthough grid-connected solar panels can reduce the fossil fuel consumption of thermal power plants, these savings are at least partly offset by the additional fossil fuels required to build and maintain what is essentially a dual energy infrastructure. Combining solar and wind power can further increase the share of renewabl…",

          "description": "This is a great overview and review by Teri Kanefield of Heather Cox Richardson's new book, Democracy Awakening.\nShe opens with: \"America is at a crossroads.\" \nBut crossroads aren't new. We've been at them before.\nShe shows how this moment is part of an ongoing struggle between a small group of white people who think that America was founded on principles of white supremacy and should remain that way, and the rest of us.\n\n\nThroughout US history, the white supremacists have seized power and implemented minority rule: secession, Jim Crow & anti-immigration laws. Then the majority pushes back: the Civil War & Reconstruction, The New Deal.\nThe current GOP is a backlash against Brown v Board of Education (the Supreme Court case that declared racial segregation in schools unconstitutional.)\nRichardson traces in detail how that backlash happened, and how today's backlash echoes the language and attitudes of the Confederacy.\nShe shows Nixon and others tied taxes to \"redistributing wealth\" to \"undeserving\" people as a way to get lower income racists aboard an economic agenda that hurt them.\n\n\nI really have to make time to read this book!\nTags: books · Democracy Awakening · Heather Cox Richardson · politics · racism · Teri Kanefield · USA",

At 10, Phase II began, during which our entire membership did not force a single man to suck another man's penis. Also, none of us blew himself/herself up in a crowded public place. No civilians were literally turned inside out via our powerful explosives. In addition, at 11, in Phase III, zero (0) planes were flown into buildings.\nDuring Phase IV, just after lunch, we were able to avoid bulldozing a single home. Furthermore, we set, on roads in every city, in every nation in the world, a total of zero (0) roadside bombs which, not being there, did not subsequently explode, killing/maiming a total of nobody. No bombs were dropped, during the lazy afternoon hours, on crowded civilian neighborhoods, from which, it was observed, no post-bomb momentary silences were then heard. These silences were, in all cases, followed by no unimaginable, grief-stricken bellows of rage, and/or frantic imprecations to a deity. No sleeping baby was awakened from an afternoon nap by the sudden collapse and/or bursting into flame of his/her domicile during Phase IV.\n\n\nIt's a timely reminder of the overwhelming huge number of people in the world who are not militant extremists — but also of the power held by the tiny minority that are.\nTags: George Saunders · politics · terrorism · war",

What you don't see is that I pretty much ripped out the main guts of the site and rewrote a key piece of it...painful but necessary for some upcoming features. Hooooopefully it's all working properly, but let me know if you see anything amiss? Especially with the membership stuff?\nAnyway, one of the changes that people using RSS/newsreaders to read the site will have noticed is that the Quick Links are no longer bundled up into a few digests/day...they now arrive as they're posted, one at a time. So if you got a bunch of old Quick Links clogging up your feedreader this morning, sorry about that — it should be a one-time thing.\nAlso regarding the RSS feed: the QL RSS items do not have titles (they are optional IIRC) and I'm getting a glimpse of the ways in which various newsreaders, uh, deal with title-less items. 😬 I've tested Feedly and Feedbin, but if you use another newsreader, would you mind emailing me a screenshot of how it handles these title-less Quick Links? Thanks!\nUpdate: Ok, I've got FreshRSS, Newsblur, Unread, Reeder, NetNewsWire, Newsify, Newsboat, Inoreader, The Old Reader, Tiny Tiny RSS, Vienna, and a few others.

The building was built incorrectly and might have blown over in a stiff wind if not for a timely intervention on the part of a mystery architecture student and the head structural engineer on the project.\nTells about designer William J. LeMessurier, who was structural consultant to the architect Hugh Stubbins, Jr. They set their 59-story tower on four massive nine-story-high stilts and used an unusual, chevron-shaped system of wind braces. LeMessurier had established the strength of those braces in perpendicular winds. Now, in the spirit of intellectual play, in his Harvard class, he wanted to see if they were just as strong in winds hitting from 45 degrees. He discovered the design flaw and during wind tunnel tests in Ontario learned the weakest joint was at the building's 30th floor.\n\n\t\nThe whole piece is here and well worth a read.

This video is 45 minutes long and during that time, a photon emitted from the Sun1 will only travel through a portion of our solar system.\n\nIn our terrestrial view of things, the speed of light seems incredibly fast. But as soon as you view it against the vast distances of the universe, it's unfortunately very slow. This animation illustrates, in realtime, the journey of a photon of light emitted from the sun and traveling across a portion of the solar system.\n\n\t\nIt takes light more than 43 minutes to travel to Jupiter and even to travel the diameter of the Sun takes 4.6 seconds. (thx, andy)\nTo even fight its way out of the Sun is an incredible journey for a photon. The Sun is so dense that a photon generated at the core is absorbed and re-emitted trillions of times by hydrogen nuclei on its way out. By some estimates, it may take up to 40,000 years for a photon to escape the Sun's surface and head on out to the cold reaches of space.↩\n[This was originally posted on February  3, 2015.]\nTags:astronomy    \nphysics    \nscience    \nvideo",

I'm not going to do a big roundup here, but here are a few things you might be interested in if you're an Amazon shopper:\nApple AirPods Pro (2nd Gen) with Lightning connector for $189 (24% off). This is the lowest price I've seen on these; they're the best headphones I've ever owned. Apple just released a newer version of these (nearly the same product except for a USB-C connector on the case) and the low price is probably to clear out inventory. Both versions charge just fine with a MagSafe or Qi-certified charger, so why not get the cheaper one if you charge that way and don't care about the small differences? Update: Both versions are the same price (I don't think they were this morning). So get the newer ones!\nApple 2020 MacBook Air Laptop M1 for $750 (25% off). This is my laptop. I love this laptop. When my daughter needed a new computer for high school, I bought her one of these.\n\n\n\nAmazon Kindle Paperwhite for $95 (32% off). I read all my books on this. Lightweight and the battery lasts forever. And it charges with USB-3 so that's one less cable to haul around.\n\n\n\nSAF Aranet4 Home CO2 Monitor for $159 (36% off). This is everyone's pick for the best indoor air quality monitor.\n\n\n\nSplendor Board Game for $20.49 (54% off). This has been a recent hit around our house...very easy to play but still difficult to master.\n\n\n\nKitchenAid 3.5 Qt. Stand Mixer for $260 (32% off). This is KitchenAid's smaller stand mixer, which is lighter and takes up less counter space in smaller kitchens.\n\nYou can find more deals on the Prime Big Deal Days page.\nWhen you buy through links on kottke.org, I may earn an affiliate commission.

It seemed the perfect place for David to introduce Planet Earth III and remind us of both the wonders and the fragility of our planet. ....and for him, of course, the sun shined under blue skies one of the only days it did all summer!.'\n\n\nThe video above is a quick first look at the series and here's a trailer as well:\n\nLooking forward to this...the Planet Earth series is still the gold standard for nature documentaries.\nTags: David Attenborough · Planet Earth · trailers · TV · video",

          "description": "From The Economist on the occasion of the award of the Nobel Prize for Medicine to Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman for their work that led to the development of the Covid-19 mRNA vaccines, a lovely short appreciation of vaccines.\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) says that vaccines have saved more from death than any other medical invention. It is a hard claim to gainsay. Vaccines protect people from disease cheaply, reliably and in remarkable numbers. And their capacity to do so continues to grow. In 2021 the who approved a first vaccine against malaria; this week it approved a second.\nVaccines are not only immensely useful; they also embody something beautifully human in their combination of care and communication. Vaccines do not trick the immune system, as is sometimes said; they educate and train it. As a resource of good public health, they allow doctors to whisper words of warning into the cells of their patients. In an age short of trust, this intimacy between government policy and an individual's immune system is easily misconstrued as a threat. But vaccines are not conspiracies or tools of control: they are molecular loving-kindness.\n\n\nThe WHO says that vaccines currently prevent 4-5 million deaths per year. The CDC points to a paper that says that more than 50 million death can be prevented  between 2021 and 2030. Vaccination is nothing short of a scientific miracle.

They are reshaping America's religious landscape as we know it.\nIn U.S. religion today, \"the most important story without a shadow of a doubt is the unbelievable rise in the share of Americans who are nonreligious,\" said Ryan Burge, a political science professor at Eastern Illinois University and author of \"The Nones,\" a book on the phenomenon.\nThe nones account for a large portion of Americans, as shown by the 30% of U.S. adults who claim no religious affiliation in a survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\nOther major surveys say the nones have been steadily increasing for as long as three decades.\nSo who are they?\nThey're the atheists, the agnostics, the \"nothing in particular.\" They're the \"spiritual but not religious,\" and those who are neither or both. They span class, gender, age, race and ethnicity.\nWhile the nones' vast diversity splinters them into myriad subgroups, most of them have this in common:\nThey. Really. Don't. Like. Organized. Religion.\n\n\nBut a dislike of organized religion among the nonreligious doesn't necessarily translate into atheism or agnosticism: 43% of \"the nones\" say they believe in God.\nTags: books · religion · Ryan Burge · The Nones · USA",

The film shows what it would be like to travel on a large, circular space station, 900 meters (0.56 miles) in diameter that rotates a 1 rpm. Even at that slow speed, which generates 0.5 g at the outermost shell, I was surprised to see how quickly the scenery (aka the Earth, Moon, etc.) was rotating and how disorienting it would be as a passenger.\nRealistically - and admittedly somewhat reluctantly — I assume that while building a structure like this is very much possible, it would be quite impractical for human passengers.\nPutting aside the perhaps most obvious problem with those wide windows being a security hazard, I believe that the perpetually spinning views would be extremely nauseating for most humans, even for short visits. Even worse, I suspect — when it comes to the comfort of the experience — would be the constantly moving light and shadows from the sun.\n\n\nI calculated that the outer ring of the space station is moving at 105.4 mph with respect to the center. That's motoring right along — no wonder everything outside is spinning so quickly.\nTags: Erik Wernquist · physics · science · space · video",

You have to laugh at the number of times he says, \"Well, I didn't want to make this film, but...\" From an accompanying profile/interview with Scorsese (which is quite good as well):\nIt is a peculiar fact about Martin Scorsese that he does not enjoy actually making movies. \"I don't mean to be funny,\" he said, \"but, the thing is, you get up real early.\" And Scorsese has never been a morning person. For most of his life, he recalled, \"I'd stay up late watching movies on TV or reading late, or doing homework late, or trying to write scripts late. I lived at night and the streets were dark, and I never saw the light. It took me many years to understand where the sun set and where the sun rose. I didn't know. I'm not kidding. I learned it in LA. When you're going on Sunset Boulevard and you hit the Pacific Coast Highway and it's seven o'clock and the sun is setting — it's right there.\"\nHe likes to borrow a complaint from Kubrick. \"They said, 'What's the hardest thing about directing?' He said, 'Getting out of the car.' Because once you get out of the car, the questions start.\" Now, when Scorsese gets out of the car in the morning, he looks at his AD and says, \"What can't I have today?\"\n\n\n Tags: film school · interviews · Martin Scorsese · movies · video",

          "description": "Megan Gray on a disturbing piece of information that was revealed in the antitrust case against Google: their search engine replaces some search queries with others that generate more commercial results (and therefore more money for the company). Here's how it works:\nGoogle likely alters queries billions of times a day in trillions of different variations. Here's how it works. Say you search for \"children's clothing.\" Google converts it, without your knowledge, to a search for \"NIKOLAI-brand kidswear,\" making a behind-the-scenes substitution of your actual query with a different query that just happens to generate more money for the company, and will generate results you weren't searching for at all. It's not possible for you to opt out of the substitution. If you don't get the results you want, and you try to refine your query, you are wasting your time. This is a twisted shopping mall you can't escape.\n\n\nYuuuck. I think it might be time to switch away from Google search — its results have been getting worse for years and it seems like the company doesn't care too much about fixing it.

Ballast fills the top of each square portal, countering the weight of the bridge deck that connects them. This symmetry allows the whole bridge structure to smoothly role through 180 degrees to a fully inverted position facilitating movement of boats from the river to the dock. This finely balanced is this system allows the 13 tonne bridge to be operated via hand winches only.\n\n\nHere's a video about the then-proposed bridge from 2019 that shows the unique rolling mechanism:\n\nAnd here's a video from earlier this year that shows the design process and how the finished bridge works:\n\nTags: architecture · Thomas Randall-Page",

Gould's passion for hummingbirds led him to travel to various parts of the world, such as North America, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, to observe and collect specimens. He also received many specimens from other naturalists and collectors.\n\n\nThe image at the top of the post is the gorgeous poster that Rougeux created from the drawings in Gould's monograph...you can order some for your walls and read a making-of.\nSee also other projects by Rougeux that I've posted about.\nTags: art · birds · design · infoviz · John Gould · Nicholas Rougeux · science",

Many of these images are time machines, showing the various meanders these rivers took hundreds and thousands of years ago. As I wrote in a post about the Mississippi River meander maps designed by Army Corps of Engineers cartographer Harold Fisk:\nFisk's maps represent the memory of a mighty river, with thousands of years of course changes compressed into a single image by a clever mapmaker with an artistic eye. Looking at them, you're invited to imagine the Mississippi as it was during the European exploration of the Americas in the 1500s, during the Cahokia civilization in the 1200s (when this city's population matched London's), when the first humans came upon the river more than 12,000 years ago, and even back to before humans, when mammoths, camels, dire wolves, and giant beavers roamed the land and gazed upon the river.\n\n\nCoe has put 4K versions of these images up on Flickr in both landscape and portrait aspect ratios. They work really well for computer and phone wallpapers — I've been using this one on various devices since I first saw it years ago.\nTags: Dan Coe · geology · Harold Fisk · rivers",

It begins:\nFor years after World War II, the \"liberal consensus\" — the New Deal idea that the federal government had a role to play in regulating business, providing a basic social safety net, and promoting infrastructure — was a true consensus. It was so widely popular that in 1950, the critic Lionel Trilling wrote of the United States that \"liberalism is not only the dominant but even the sole intellectual tradition.\"\nBut the Supreme Court's 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision declaring segregation in public schools unconstitutional tied the federal government to ensuring not just economic equality, but also civil rights. Opponents of the liberal consensus argued that the newly active federal government was misusing tax dollars taken from hardworking white men to promote civil rights for \"undeserving\" Black people. The troops President Dwight Eisenhower sent to Little Rock Central High School in 1957, for example, didn't come cheap. The government's defense of civil rights redistributed wealth, they said, and so was virtually socialism.\n\n\n Tags: books · Democracy Awakening · Heather Cox Richardson · politics · racism · USA",

          "description": "Heather Cox Richardson, author of the excellent Letters from an American newsletter, has a new book out today about the health of American democracy: Democracy Awakening: Notes on the State of America. From Virginia Heffernan's review of the book in the Washington Post:\nShe has an intriguing origin point for today's afflictions: the New Deal. The first third of the book, which hurtles toward Donald Trump's election, is as bingeable as anything on Netflix. \"Democracy Awakening\" starts in the 1930s, when Americans who'd been wiped out in the 1929 stock market crash were not about to let the rich demolish the economy again. New Deal programs designed to benefit ordinary people and prevent future crises were so popular that by 1960 candidates of both parties were advised to simply \"nail together\" coalitions and promise them federal funding. From 1946 to 1964, the liberal consensus — with its commitments to equality, the separation of church and state, and the freedoms of speech, press and religion — held sway.\nBut Republican businessmen, who had caused the crash, despised the consensus. Richardson's account of how right-wingers appropriated the word \"socialism\" from the unrelated international movement is astute. When invoked to malign all government investment, \"socialism\" served to recruit segregationist Democrats, who could be convinced that the word meant Black people would take their money, and Western Democrats, who resented government protections on land and water. This new Republican Party created an ideology that coalesced around White Christianity and free markets.\n\n\nHeffernan calls this first part of Richardson's book \"the most lucid just-so story for Trump's rise I've ever heard\". I'm in the midst of two other books right now (The Vaster Wilds & The Mountain in the Sea) but I might have to make room for a third.\nTags: books · Democracy Awakening · Heather Cox Richardson · politics · USA · Virginia Heffernan",

The chart in question is from a piece in the most recent issue of the American Journal of Physics with the understated title of \"All objects and some questions\".\nIn Fig. 2, we plot all the composite objects in the Universe: protons, atoms, life forms, asteroids, moons, planets, stars, galaxies, galaxy clusters, giant voids, and the Universe itself. Humans are represented by a mass of 70 kg and a radius of 50 cm (we assume sphericity), while whales are represented by a mass of 10^5 kg and a radius of 7 m.\n\n\nThe \"sub-Planckian unknown\" and \"forbidden by gravity\" sections of the chart makes the \"quantum uncertainty\" section seem downright normal — the paper collectively calls these \"unphysical regions\". Lovely turns of phrase all.\nBut what does it all mean? My physics is too rusty to say, but I thought one of the authors' conjectures was particularly intriguing: \"Our plot of all objects also seems to suggest that the Universe is a black hole.\" Huh, cool.\nTags: infoviz · physics · science",

From the Public Domain Review:\nThe Blood Book is handmade, folio-sized, with a handsome marbled endpaper and forty-three pages of exquisitely crafted decoupage. John Bingley Garland, the manuscript's creator, used collage techniques, excising illustrations from other books to assemble elegant, balanced compositions. Most of the source material is Romantic engravings by William Blake and his ilk, but there are also brilliantly colored flowers and fruits. Snakes are a favorite motif, butterflies another. A small bird is centered on every page. The space between the images is filled with tiny hand-written script that reads like a staccato sermon. \"One! yet has larger bounties! to bestow! Joys! Powers! untasted! In a World like this, Powers!\" etc.\nThe book's reputation, however, rests on a decorative detail that overwhelms: To each page, Garland added languid, crimson drops in red India ink, hanging from the cut-out images like pendalogues from a chandelier. Blood drips from platters of grapes and tree boughs, statuaries and skeletons. Crosses seep, a cheetah drools, angels dangle bloody sashes. A bouquet of white chrysanthemums is spritzed.\nTo be clear, Garland's blood is not that of surgery or crime or menses, but of religious iconography. He obviously intended the blood to represent Christ's own.\n\n\nThe Blood Book are strikingly modern; as PDR states, Garland uses \"techniques usually dated to Cubism in the early twentieth century\" to make his collages. I love running across seemingly out-of-time objects like this.\nTags: art · John Bingley Garland · religion",

The second is expressing genuine regret, and where possible, acknowledging our shortcoming. Our intentions are not always good. Sometimes we're selfish. Sometimes we don't know what we're doing, and sometimes we fail to consider the consequences. If we can admit these things, it helps repair trust.\nThen we vow, in good faith, to not perpetuate the same harm again.\nThe last step is repair. This means directly addressing the harm done — not via self-flagellation on YouTube nor with any expectation of forgiveness.\n\n\nI posted about how to apologize a few years ago after reading Katie Heaney's piece on, wait for it, celebrity non-apologies:\nHere are the six components of an apology from Beth Polin:\n1.

In the 1970s, the meatball was switched out for the worm, a more Modernist take:\n\nThis logo was done by Richard Danne and Bruce Blackburn, and Danne wrote an essay about the experience.\nAnd here is one of the most interesting exchanges I've ever witnessed in a design presentation:\nFletcher: \"I'm simply not comfortable with those letters, something is missing.\"\nOthers, not just the designers were stunned by this last comment. Then the discussion moved back to the strong red/rust color we were proposing. We had tried many other colors of course, including the more predictable blue range, but settled on red because it suggested action and animation. It seemed in spirit with the Can Do nature of the Space Agency.\nFletcher: And this color, red, it doesn't make much sense to me.\"\n\n\t\nNASA's Graphics Standards Menu utilizing the worm logo can be seen here.\n\nThe space agency switched back to the original logo in 1992. Michael Bierut compared the two:\nThe worm is a great-looking word mark and looked fantastic on the spacecraft. By any objective measure, the worm was and is absolutely appropriate, and the meatball was and is an amateurish mess.\n\n\t\n(thx, jarrett)\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n[This was originally posted on August 20, 2015.]\nTags:Bruce Blackburn    \ndesign    \nlogos    \nMichael Bierut    \nNASA    \nRichard Danne",

The US isn't making that same shift right now — this video from Vox explores why...and how we can move in that direction.\nFortunately, there's a hero waiting in the wings: the e-cargo bike. Not only can these bad boys deliver packages in urban environments just as quickly (and sometimes faster) than delivery vans, they take up far less space and are much less likely to cause pedestrian deaths. Companies like Amazon, DHL, and UPS are using them in several European cities, but American cities haven't followed suit. \nIn this video, we explore why that is, and lay out some of the big steps American cities would need to take to join the e-bike delivery revolution.\n\n\nSee also No Cars Allowed in This Swiss Town (Except Tiny Electric Ones).\nTags: cars · cities · e-bikes · video",

In this video, Kurzgesagt explores the possibilities and impossibilities. This part baked my noodle (in a good way):\nContrary to widespread belief, the singularity of a black hole is not really \"at its center\". It's in the future of whatever crosses the horizon. Black holes warp the universe so drastically that, at the event horizon, space and time switch their roles. Once you cross it, falling towards the center means going towards the future. That's why you cannot escape: Stopping your fall and turning back would be just as impossible as stopping time and traveling to the past. So the singularity is actually in your future, not \"in front of you\". And just like you can't see your own future, you won't see the singularity until you hit it.\n\n\n🤯\nTags: black holes · Kurzgesagt · physics · science · video",

He spoke to the NY Times about how his work puts him in the flow state:\n\"I loved that when I worked on a piece, I didn't think about my problems — my divorce, the pandemic,\" said Mr. Cortes. \"It was an escape — like I'm meditating, literally floating. I didn't have a problem in the world. I wanted that high again, I kept chasing that.\"\n\n\nLove that and love the miniatures...they are crazy realistic.\nBlighted façades and distressed structures are the very scenes which fuel Daniel's attention to detail. The work to produce each piece is arduous and requires great precision to achieve such realism. Daniel had developed techniques that can give a model an aged, distressed or patinated style. He also recreates miniature scaled vintage advertising posters and graffiti art on his models. Daniel's miniature models make unique collectable creations that will take you on a gritty romantic journey through New York that everyday passers by have overlooked.\n\n\nYou can check out more of Cortes' work on Instagram.\nTags: art · Danny Cortes · NYC",

It's time we worked together towards a world where all people have the power and resources to care for and support their bodies, identities, and health — for themselves and their families. We need to take the hassle, hustle, and harassment out of healthcare. It's time to change the conversation about abortion, to make it a real option, available to all people without shame or judgment. We all love someone who has had an abortion, whether we know it or not.\n\n\nThe video is three years old and from the very first line (\"Abortion is legal in all 50 states\"), you can tell how much the situation has changed in the United States — and how the NNAF's mission is even more urgent.

A dolls house or a spaceship.\nA lot of boys like dolls houses. They're more human than spaceships. A lot of girls prefer spaceships. They're more exciting than dolls houses.\nThe most important thing is to the put the right material in the their hands and let them create whatever appeals to them.\n\n\t\nThe letter seems like the sort of thing that might be fake, but Robbie Gonzalez of io9 presents the case for its authenticity.\nIn our home, Lego currently rules the roost...the kids (a boy and a girl) spend more time building with Lego than doing anything else. This weekend, they worked together to build a beach scene, with a house, pool, lifeguard station, car, pond (for skimboarding), and surfers. Dollhouse stuff basically.

While not as dramatic as some of the others, it documented the discovery of a previously unknown feature of a nearby cosmic neighbor:\nThe Andromeda galaxy is the closest spiral galaxy to our own Milky Way, and one of the most photographed deep-sky objects. Yet this particular photo, captured by an international trio of amateur astronomers, revealed a feature that had never been seen before: a huge plasma arc, stretching out across space right next to the Andromeda galaxy.\n\"Scientists are now investigating the newly discovered giant in a transnational collaboration,\" explain the photographers. \"It could be the largest such structure nearest to us in the Universe.\"\n\n\nYou can see the rest of the winning images on the Royal Observatory site as well as coverage from the BBC, the Guardian, Colossal, and Universe Today.\nTags: astronomy · best of · best of 2023 · photography · science · space",

Elizabeth played a crucial role in her husband's lavish publications, creating beautifully detailed and historically significant accurate illustrations of over six hundred birds -many of which were new to science. However, Elizabeth's role was not always fully credited and, following her tragic death aged only thirty-seven, her efforts and talent were nearly forgotten.\n\n\nBirds of the World: The Art of Elizabeth Gould is available for pre-order from Amazon or Bookshop.org and comes out on November 7.

It doesn't give us much in the way of plot or character updates, but here's the season synopsis (spoilers if you're not caught up to the end of season three):\nRocketing into the new millennium in the eight years since Season 3, Happy Valley has rapidly expanded its footprint on Mars by turning former foes into partners. Now 2003, the focus of the space program has turned to the capture and mining of extremely valuable, mineral-rich asteroids that could change the future of both Earth and Mars. But simmering tensions between the residents of the now-sprawling international base threaten to undo everything they are working towards.\n\n\nI have to admit my interest in the show waned a bit after the first season, but it's still a pretty great show and I will be tuning in for season four on November 10.

It's full of interested tidbits throughout, like:\nCare to gawk at one of the world's last surviving original radium standards, a glass ampoule filled with 20.28 milligrams of radium chloride prepared by Marie Curie in 1913? NIST has it in the basement, encased in a steel bathtub, buried under lead bricks.\n\n\nAnd:\nFor GPS to work, it needs ultra-exact timing: accuracy within fifteen meters requires precision on the order of fifty nanoseconds. The 5G networks powering our mobile phones demand ever more precise levels of cell-tower synchronization or calls get dropped.\n\n\nAnd:\nAnd as Mumford could have predicted, nowhere has time become so fetishized as in the financial sector, with the emergence over the past decade of algorithmic high-frequency trading. Donald MacKenzie, the author of Trading at the Speed of Light, estimated in 2019 that a trading program could receive market data and trigger an order in eighty-four nanoseconds, or eighty-four billionths of a second.\n\n\nAnd:\nAll this makes F1 staggeringly accurate: it will gain or shed only one second every 100,000,000 years. Since the days when time was defined astronomically, the accuracy of the second is estimated to have increased by a magnitude of eight.\n\n\nAnd:\n\"A clock accurate to a second over the age of the cosmos,\" Patrick Gill, a physicist at the U.K.'s National Physical Laboratory, is quoted as saying in New Scientist, \"would allow tests of whether physical laws and constants have varied over the universe's history.\"\n\n\nAnd:\n\"If you were to lift this clock up a centimeter of elevation,\" Hume told me, \"you would be able to discern a difference in the ticking rate.\" The reason is Einstein's theory of relativity: Time differs depending on where you are experiencing it.\n\n\nAnd I could go on and on. If any or all of those tidbits is interesting to you, you should go ahead and read the whole thing.\nTags: physics · science · time · Tom Vanderbilt",

Empty cavities and bright filaments alternate and give the impression of ripples propagating from the spiral arms. The yellow compact regions indicate the newly formed star clusters in the galaxy.\n\n\n(via bad astronomy)\nTags: astronomy · James Webb Space Telescope · NASA · photography · science · space",

          "description": "About once a year, boat owners on Wisconsin's Lake Chippewa gather to move a small floating island from blocking access under a bridge. It's a simple application of Newtonian physics: the boats all just nose into the island, gun their motors, and slowly shove the island out of the way.\nThe floating clump of mud and plant material is technically a bog, not an island, but it's hefty enough to support the growth of trees all the same. Looking at it, you could easily believe it was a fully-fledged island. That is... until it starts drifting around.\n\"It's one of the first things you look for when you come out here in the morning; where's the bog?\" Denny Reyes, owner of The Landing in Chippewa, told Arizona News.\nThe problematic bog is actually one of many, but it's one of the biggest and close to a bridge that can get blocked when it goes for a wander. In 2022, with the wind on their side, it took around 25 boats to budge the bog and collectively push it back out into the lake.\n\n\n Tags: time lapse · video",

          "description": "Going to the movies used to be a somewhat different experience than it is today: people wandered into a theater at any point in a film and would just watch until it looped back around when they came in. From a piece in the Hollywood Reporter:\nThroughout the classical Hollywood era, moviegoers dropped in on a film screening whenever they felt like it, heedless of the progress of the narrative. In the usual formulation, a couple go to the movies, enter midway into the feature film, sit through to the end of the movie, watch the newsreel, cartoon, and comedy short at the top of the program, and then sit through the feature film until they recognize the scene they walked in on. At this point, one moviegoer whispers to their partner, \"This is where we came in,\" and they exit the theater.\n\n\nThis began to change in the 40s and 50s for a variety of reasons — theater owners and movie studios didn't like it, movies were getting more complex, the rise of TV, etc. — but the real shift occurred with the premiere of Psycho in 1960. The studio put out a promotional blitz before it's release stating that no one would be allowed entrance to the theater after the start of the film.\nOn June 16, 1960, after a saturation campaign giving fair warning, the DeMille and Baronet theaters in New York premiered Psycho with the see-it-from-the-beginning edict in place. In a practice later to be known as \"fill and spill,\" exhibitors hustled audiences in and out with military efficiency (the staggered showtimes — every two-hours for the 109-minute film — made for a tight squeeze). Uniformed Pinkerton guards were on hand to enforce the policy.\n\n\nHere's a video of Hitchcock laying out the policy for moviegoers (via open culture):\n\nPsycho didn't singlehandedly stop the practice, but Hitchcock's stand was an important part in shifting moviegoing practices to the set start times we have today.\nTags: Alfred Hitchcock · movies · Psycho · video",

Austin Kleon elaborated on scenius in his book Show Your Work:\nThere's a healthier way of thinking about creativity that the musician Brian Eno refers to as \"scenius.\" Under this model, great ideas are often birthed by a group of creative individuals — artists, curators, thinkers, theorists, and other tastemakers — who make up an \"ecology of talent.\" If you look back closely at history, many of the people who we think of as lone geniuses were actually part of \"a whole scene of people who were supporting each other, looking at each other's work, copying from each other, stealing ideas, and contributing ideas.\" Scenius doesn't take away from the achievements of those great individuals: it just acknowledges that good work isn't created in a vacuum, and that creativity is always, in some sense, a collaboration, the result of a mind connected to other minds.\n\n\n Tags: Ariel Schulman · Austin Kleon · Brian Eno · Casey Neistat · Greta Gerwig · Henry Joost · Lena Dunham · movies · Nev Schulman · NYC · Safdie brothers · Van Neistat · video",

States now offer a vast menu of personalized plate options for a dizzying array of organizations, professions, sports teams, causes and other groups. \nMy count was conducted over June and July 2023, so this should be considered a snapshot, as I'm sure some plates have changed already.\n\n\nFun fact: finishers of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race are eligible to get a special \"Iditarod Finisher\" plate for their car.\nLess fun fact, per Keegan:\nYes, license plates are still made by cheap prison labor in most states. 80% of all license plates issued in the U.S. today were made by state prisoners, with only 12 states opting out of the practice. According to a 2022 ACLU report on prison labor in the U.S., many states offer no pay at all to prisoners, while the average hourly wage across the country was between 13 and 52 cents per hour.\n\n\nHere in Vermont, the use of prison labor for manufacturing things like license plates resulted in the image of a pig hidden in a cow's spots appearing on an official crest emblazoned on state police cars back in 2012.\nTags: design · Jon Keegan · prison · USA",

Tomatoes, eggplants, and peppers, for example, require \"buzz pollination;\" bees have to vibrate their bodies to shake the pollen free — a behavior that honey bees can't do (bumblebees and some other native species can).\nYet these free services native bees provide are dwindling.

Michael Mann hasn't made a film since 2015's Blackhat and hasn't made an award-winning film since 2004's Collateral, so it's nice to see him back in the director's chair. The film is based on Brock Yates' 1991 book Enzo Ferrari: The Man and the Machine.\nNext to the Pope, Ferrari was the most revered man in Italy. But was he the benign padrone portrayed by an adoring world press at the time, or was he a ruthless despot, who drove his staff to the edge of madness, and his racing drivers even further?\nBrock Yates's definitive biography penetrated Ferrari's elaborately constructed veneer and uncovered the truth behind Ferrari's bizarre relationships, his work with Mussolini's fascists, and his fanatical obsession with speed.\n\n\nFerrari just premiered at the Venice Film Festival and early reviews are mostly positive but not overwhelmingly so. The film opens on Dec 25 in the US.\nTags: Adam Driver · cars · Ferrari · Michael Mann · movies · trailers · video",

          "description": "In 1856, a 17-year-old girl named Adeline Harris started making a unique quilt. Over the next two decades, she sent pieces of silk to famous people from around the world and they signed them and sent them back to her. She assembled them into a quilt with a tumbling blocks pattern (aka, the Q*bert pattern).\nThe signatures that Harris was able to acquire are astounding: Harriet Beecher Stowe, Charles Dickens, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Samuel Morse, Alexandre Dumas, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Alexander von Humboldt, Washington Irving, and Nathaniel Hawthorne. Oh, and eight US Presidents: Martin Van Buren, John Tyler, Millard Fillmore, Franklin Pierce, James Buchanan, Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Johnson, and Ulysses S. Grant.\nThe aesthetics of this thing are just marvelous, with all the different colors and patterns arranged into a strict grid.\nOh and I couldn't resist checking The Great Span of the quilt. The earliest-born signatory I could find is Alexander von Humboldt, who was born in 1769, and the last person to die was Mary Virginia Hawes Terhune, who died in 1922. That's a span of 154 years, all in one incredible quilt.\nI found this via the Public Domain Review, who is offering prints of the quilt.\nTags: Adeline Harris · art",

          "description": "Oh yay, I had been wondering just the other day what Errol Morris has been up to and it turns out to be a project with Apple TV+ called The Pigeon Tunnel, which is billed as the final interview with espionage novelist John le Carré (born David Cornwell).\nIt's terribly difficult to recruit for a secret service. You're looking for somebody who's a bit bad, but at the same time, loyal. There's a type. And I fit it perfectly.\n\n\nThe movie has the same title and covers some of the same ground as le Carré's 2016 memoir, probably with more of an emphasis on Morris's general obsession with what constitutes truth. More info on the film from the Toronto International Film Festival, where the movie is premiering on Sept 11:\nCornwell once worked for the British spy agencies MI5 and MI6. He sparingly gave interviews, but accepted Morris' invitation because he saw it \"as something definitive.\" He had already begun a process of opening up in his memoir The Pigeon Tunnel: Stories from My Life.\nCrucial to the narrative is the author's relationship to his father Ronnie, an inveterate gambler and con artist. Cornwell's mother disappeared when he was five, so his main frame of reference was the world of his father, who was endlessly on the run from the mob or the police. The title The Pigeon Tunnel comes from Cornwell's experience as a child going to Monte Carlo with Ronnie. Imprinted on his memory was a shooting range on the top of a cliff. Beneath the grass was a tunnel from which trapped pigeons were ejected over the sea as targets.\n\n\nThe Pigeon Tunnel will be out on Apple TV+ on Oct 20, 2023.\nTags: books · Errol Morris · espionage · John le Carre · movies · The Pigeon Tunnel · trailers · video",

          "description": "Market researcher Clotaire Rapaille was interviewed for an episode of Frontline on advertising and marketing back in 2003. I like what he had to say about the differences in how the French and Americans think about cheese.\nFor example, if I know that in America the cheese is dead, which means is pasteurized, which means legally dead and scientifically dead, and we don't want any cheese that is alive, then I have to put that up front. I have to say this cheese is safe, is pasteurized, is wrapped up in plastic. I know that plastic is a body bag. You can put it in the fridge. I know the fridge is the morgue; that's where you put the dead bodies. And so once you know that, this is the way you market cheese in America.\nI started working with a French company in America, and they were trying to sell French cheese to the Americans. And they didn't understand, because in France the cheese is alive, which means that you can buy it young, mature or old, and that's why you have to read the age of the cheese when you go to buy the cheese. So you smell, you touch, you poke. If you need cheese for today, you want to buy a mature cheese. If you want cheese for next week, you buy a young cheese. And when you buy young cheese for next week, you go home, [but] you never put the cheese in the refrigerator, because you don't put your cat in the refrigerator. It's the same; it's alive. We are very afraid of getting sick with cheese. By the way, more French people die eating cheese than Americans die. But the priority is different; the logic of emotion is different. The French like the taste before safety. Americans want safety before the taste.\n\n\t\n(via @pieratt)\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n[This was originally posted on July 29, 2013.]\nTags:cheese    \nClotaire Rapaille    \nfood",

          "description": "In a lecture given in 1924, German mathematician David Hilbert introduced the idea of the paradox of the Grand Hotel, which might help you wrap your head around the concept of infinity. (Spoiler alert: it probably won't help...that's the paradox.) In his book One Two Three... Infinity, George Gamow describes Hilbert's paradox:\nLet us imagine a hotel with a finite number of rooms, and assume that all the rooms are occupied. A new guest arrives and asks for a room. \"Sorry,\" says the proprietor, \"but all the rooms are occupied.\" Now let us imagine a hotel with an infinite number of rooms, and all the rooms are occupied. To this hotel, too, comes a new guest and asks for a room.\n\"But of course!\" exclaims the proprietor, and he moves the person previously occupying room N1 into room N2, the person from room N2 into room N3, the person from room N3 into room N4, and so on.... And the new customer receives room N1, which became free as the result of these transpositions.\nLet us imagine now a hotel with an infinite number of rooms, all taken up, and an infinite number of new guests who come in and ask for rooms.\n\"Certainly, gentlemen,\" says the proprietor, \"just wait a minute.\"\nHe moves the occupant of N1 into N2, the occupant of N2 into N4, and occupant of N3 into N6, and so on, and so on...\nNow all odd-numbered rooms became free and the infinite of new guests can easily be accommodated in them.\n\n\t\nThis TED video created by Jeff Dekofsky explains that there are similar strategies for finding space in such a hotel for infinite numbers of infinite groups of people and even infinite amounts of infinite numbers of infinite groups of people (and so on, and so on...) and is very much worth watching:\n\n(via brain pickings)\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n[This was originally posted on February 19, 2015.]\nTags:David Hilbert    \nGeorge Gamow    \ninfinity    \nJeff Dekofsky    \nmathematics    \nvideo",

With that, writes Bill McKibben, has come a sense of unease about the future, particularly about the places we live and will be able to live.\nDrawing on his experience as a Vermonter, McKibben argues that no place is truly safe from the effects of the climate crisis, but we can find protection from it by rebuilding our sense of community and social trust. Those things can provide the resilience we're going to need to get though this.\nWe've come through 75 years where having neighbors was essentially optional: if you had a credit card, you could get everything you needed to survive dropped off at your front door. But the next 75 years aren't going to be like that; we're going to need to return to the basic human experience of relying on the people around you. We're going to need to rediscover that we're a social species, which for Americans will be hard — at least since Reagan we've been told to think of ourselves first and foremost (it was his pal Margaret Thatcher who insisted 'there is no such thing as society, only individual men and women.\") And in the Musk/Trump age we're constantly instructed to distrust everyone and everything, a corrosion that erodes the social fabric as surely as a rampaging river erodes a highway.\n\n\n Tags: Bill McKibben · climate crisis · politics · Vermont",

Not who has what chances of winning, but the consequences for our democracy. Not the odds, but the stakes.\n\n\nRosen first articulated this principle more than a decade ago and ever since reading about it a few years ago, I've all but stopped reading and linking to political horse race coverage. Who scored more \"points\" in the latest debate? Which candidate seems the most Presidential? Will his mugshot bolster his campaign? Come on, this isn't the goddamned Oscars red carpet. Tell us what the candidates' plans are and how they will affect how Americans live their lives. What experience do they have in governance? Or if not governance, in leadership? What do they believe, what actions have they taken in the past and what consequences have those actions had on actual people? What motivates them...power, money, fame, service? Many many people will not give a shit about any of this, but if we want to retain a functioning democracy with a press that's not primarily about entertainment, voters need to know what they are getting into.\n\nAnd I would argue, how they should cover many other important issues. So much of \"tech\" news reads like horse race coverage instead of focusing what kind of world would result if Company A or Technology B were to succeed. Journalists and outlets that cover the stakes get my attention.↩\n\nTags: Jay Rosen · journalism · politics · USA",

This doesn't seem good:\nThere is little precedent for a civilian's becoming the arbiter of a war between nations in such a granular way, or for the degree of dependency that the U.S. now has on Musk in a variety of fields, from the future of energy and transportation to the exploration of space. SpaceX is currently the sole means by which nasa transports crew from U.S. soil into space, a situation that will persist for at least another year. The government's plan to move the auto industry toward electric cars requires increasing access to charging stations along America's highways.
