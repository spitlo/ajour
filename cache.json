In fact, I might have gone a bit too far, as I managed to stream full resolution video and even play games via WiFi. But see for yourself: Click the image to see the video on youtube.com. So, as usual, you have two alternatives to start here: Watch the video or read the article. If you are just curious and want to see what I did, definitely check out the video. If you want to understand exactly how it works and if you want to reproduce it or find tricks for your own projects, go for the article and the linked code. In any case, if you have not seen the previous article and/or video on the cartridge itself, you should start there.",

At this point, it can only demo a simple telnet-style communication and access Wikipedia articles, but I am confident that I will showcase more in the future. For now, the interesting and surprisingly tricky part is how the thing works at all. Click the image to see the video on youtube.com. If you just want to see the cartridge in action or want to get into all the details, I highly recommend to watch the video first as it goes through the difficulties and their respective solutions. In contrast, this article here is less visual in its explanations and mostly documents the device in detail, so unless you are already familiar with the parallel memory interface of the Game Boy, you might want to start with the overview from the video.",

For example, I read Call of the Wild, an 80(ish) page book in 4 weeks and then I read a 400 page book in 4 days… so it's really swings and roundabouts.\nI recorded 21 books on my Kindle this year, but actually one of them was read aloud to the kids (Which I do still count) but another one was all of 19 pages… which, I think really doesn't count (it was Home: Habitat, Range, Niche, Territory by Martha Wells). So… 20 books then.\nThis post is mostly data driven (from my own web site's data) to give me a sense of the quality of the books I've read, otherwise individual reviews are all linked in this post or available on my books page.",

          "description": "Lovely but I found the language almost too distracting.\nOnly right at the end of the book did I consider that maybe I really wasn't the right audience for the story - as it seemed to smack of \"millennium type problems\". Using air quotes in my description because I'm fairly sure this is a patronising statement I'm making!\nThe Dex character feels discontent with their achievements and is struggling to find fulfilling meaning. Their work has meaning to others but they're left feeling empty. Obviously it's an impossible measure as life trondles forward and achievements change with time.\nFor me it was only really when Dex meets the Robot (whose name I've already forgotten) when the book became more engaging. It was like the Dex character could be challenged and some real depth was offered (for better or worse for Dex's personality).\nBut what I did struggle with was the language and the odd shoehorning of gender pronouns. Dex is neither \"he\" or \"she\", so Chamber's settles with using the \"they\" pronoun. This led to my own confusion regularly thinking the lines I was reading was referring to Dex and another character that was in the scene.\nThe sore-thumb moment is when Dex asks, interestingly, what pronoun the Robot uses, and the Robot responds with \"it\" and it refers to itself as an object. Dex replies with (something like) they are the same, and their pronoun is \"they\". This seemed like a potentially interesting exchange between the Robot and Dex about the subject of how one refers to oneself and how they identify, but it doesn't happen. It just has that exchange, and then the story returns to what they were doing and carries on. It felt jarring and like Chamber's wanted to discuss this topic, but instead shoe horned it in.\nI do also suspect that my trouble with the language is a me-thing and probably with practice it won't cause me as much (or any) confusion, but for now, and this book, it definitely affected how I enjoyed the story.",

These two characters together made it rather difficult to want to keep reading their story, but I'm glad I did persevere.Although the story is a little cliche, around four fifths the way through the book, it does a pretty good job to win me over to the main characters and I want to see them happy by the end of the story.Probably a little bit too long, but worth it for the payoff at the end.",

I honestly did find the amount of sex in the book kind of over the top. I can buy that Kvothe is a legend character and one part of that is perhaps he has a reputation with women, but I'm not wholely sure I needed the many-month-long shagathon story when Kvothe is away with the faeries…\nStill, even with this, I found myself wanting to stay in the world for as long as I could.\nThe very ending, like the last few pages of The Name of the Wind did surprise me a left me a little confused, but I like to think that one day The Doors of Stone will answer some of those questions…",

They're a builder, all right, as \nlong as you want them to build X.  Perhaps they have been building X at \nsome other company, and now your company has hired them to come and do \nthat same job over here instead.\n\n\nThere's also the possibility that the prestige of having this person \nworking at the company is what they're actually cultivating, and \nmanagement wants to make this person happy by letting them work on their \npet project, even if the pet project itself is not doing anything \npositive.\n\nactually belongs in \nproduction.  In one outcome, it's brilliantly executed and things grow.  \nBut, this is about the downsides, and in that scenario, it's a stinking \npile of garbage and needs to be thrown out, but it gets forced in, \nanyway.\n\n\nIf this project is being pushed for political reasons, then it should \nnot come as a surprise that when it finally does ship to production,\nit causes outages and generally fails to deliver on its promises.  It's \nactually worse than just leaving things the way they had been before any \nof this stuff showed up.\n\n\nJust imagine what companies would look like if their hiring processes \nfiltered out this kind of charlatan instead of looking for whether they \ncould do some dumb coding card trick in a 45 minute interview block.\nI think they'd look very different, and a whole bunch of people would \nhave to find another industry to prey upon.",
