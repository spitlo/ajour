          "description": "Cutting to the chase: text editors *and* tabs vs. spaces!  Ooooh!\n\n\nI've had this thing called \"e\" for a while now.  It's a stupid little \nscript which serves to do a couple of things.  It starts my \neditor\nwith a given file, and it kicks it with the right arguments to make it \ndisable line wrapping and to make the [TAB] key actually put in two \nspaces.\n\n\nSo, my dumb script would use \"-w -E -T 2\" most of the time, except when it \nwas running on a Makefile, at which point it would skip those args.  \nSimple enough, right?\n\n\npico is back?  Yes indeed, on Macs, as of 12.3, pico is in fact back.  To \nmake sure I wasn't imagining things, I tracked down a machine that hadn't \nbeen upgraded yet and checked there.  Sure enough, it was in fact nano and \nnot pico.\n\n\nmacOS 12.3 has nano as a symlink... pointing to pico!\n\n\nAt some point, I switched from literal tab characters in my source code to \nblobs of spaces, probably due to using that style at work and not hating \nit.  So, somewhere along the line I actually started depending on nano \nbehavior without realizing it.\n\n\nAs for the lack of a feature in pico itself, it's kind of strange, really.  \nIf you go digging into the source, they have this random.c with a function \ncalled tab which claims to \"simulate tab stop\" using spaces.  That said, I \ncan't find any place where it would be called with the magic values which \nwould make it behave that way.\n\n\nIt wouldn't surprise me if this switch is just more of Apple removing \nGPLed things from their OS - pico seems to use the Apache license.  They \ndumped bash for zsh (MIT license) at some point (Big Sur, I think), and \nnow this?  Okay then.",

          "description": "Here's a very old and stupid trick you could do with some filesystems in \nsome situations back in the day... and might still be able to do in a \nfew places today.\n\n\nThe problem is that while version X might eventually have an exploit, \nit'll get removed and it'll be replaced by version Y without that\nparticular hole.  By the time you get your hands on a tool to break into \nX, it'll be gone.\n\n\nWhat you'd do is create a hard link pointing at the file you wanted to \npreserve, storing it in a spot which was writable by your account.  \nThen, say, /usr/bin/sudo (because that never has security \nissues...) gets replaced at some point with a new file and you get to \nkeep the old version.  When you get the tool to pop it, off you go!\n\n\nOf course, these days, it's not quite so easy on the more modern systems \nyou find.  Debian 11 here won't let me do it - it's EPERM city.  Rocky 8 \n(so CentOS 8 and RHEL 8 too) also won't do it.  They both have some gunk\nin /usr/lib/sysctl.d to lock this down.  But, my old Slackware 14.2 \ninstall of my workstation let me do it the last time I tried about \na year ago.  How about that, huh?  I bet it'd still work if I dug out \nthe old drives and booted them up.\n\n\nIncidentally, this is the magic sauce: /proc/sys/fs/protected_hardlinks\nRead the man page for proc(5) to learn more about it.\n\nhere it is,\nthe thread I read a long time ago.  It's interesting to note that as far \nas I can tell, nothing actually changed upstream.  This left paranoid \nadmins like me with no option but to use the (most excellent) Openwall \npatches to lock down this kind of stuff.  I used that on my machines at \nwork which had non-staff users... just in case.\n\n\nThis whole situation is scary.  \nRead more about it.",

          "description": "One of the fun things I used to do at a prior job was to dig through the \nraw data points which were collected from the *many* servers we had.  I \ncould just pick an interesting-sounding metric and then would just ask \nthe system to show me the top 10 or bottom 10 out of a population of \nthousands or more.\n\n\nTo get my feet wet with the whole \"investigations\" thing that we'd do, I \nstarted looking into this one day and chose one of the many temp sensors \nwhich were being logged by the servers.  I forget exactly which one it \nwas, for there were many.  The CPUs logged it, the chassis logged it, \nthe power supply logged it, and so on.  There were so many choices.\n\n\nI went looking for a reason.  What could possibly explain this?  First \noff, it didn't line up with any obvious pattern in the host names.  The \nhosts were named for whichever team owned them, followed by a sequence \nnumber that was bumped any time a new one was provisioned.  There was no \nsignal to be found in that.\n\n\nThere was more, though.  You could also see a \"rack position\" in this \ndata, and now it started getting interesting.  It seems that all of the \nreally hot machines had a rack position of something low, like 04 or 05, \nand never anything higher than that.  In fact, when looking at a whole \nrack, it was always the lowest number of all of the positions that were \nbeing used.  Now this was worth chasing!\n\n\nIt's good that I asked, since they told me something surprising: \nposition 04 or 05 or whatever was the *bottom* of the rack.  Yes, \nsomehow, the lowest machine in the rack was the hottest!  They found \nthis interesting, too, and wound up digging into it.  Given that I was \nfar away in a distant office, this was the best way for us to proceed.\n\n\nThe problem was that the bottommost server would have nothing below it \nbut just open space until it got to the floor.  That space would not \nmove air efficiently, and it obviously mattered.\n\n\nThis rolled out and my hot spots disappeared.  Fantastic!",

In short, it looks like every Raspberry Pi filesystem installed \nfrom any given release image probably ends up with the same\nUUID.\n\n\nFor instance, if you downloaded the \"lite\" version of Raspbian between \nroughly November 8th and January 28th, you probably got a file called \n2021-10-30-raspios-bullseye-armhf-lite.zip.  Inside, there's an image, \nand the idea is that you dump that straight to your SD card, cram it in \nthe Pi, and off you go.  The second partition on that image is an ext4 \nfilesystem which was created on some build machine somewhere.  The UUID \non it never gets \"evolved\" to something else after the install.\n\n\nYou can see it inside the image itself here:\n\n\nOr, if you actually installed a few of these things like I did over the \npast couple of months, you can just 'tune2fs -l /dev/mmcblk0p2' and see \nthe same value in there.\n\n\nDon't end up with a pile of SD cards on your desk and think \"I know, \nI'll use the filesystem UUIDs to track which one goes where\", in other \nwords.\n\n\nIf it's not breaking anything for you, it's probably best to just let it \nbe.  Untangling a boot mess on these weird little boxes is anything but \nfun.\n\nNote: if you're actually on a recent Raspberry Pi, odds are good that \nyour /etc/fstab will be using *partition* UUIDs (PARTUUID=...) and not \nthose of the filesystem.
