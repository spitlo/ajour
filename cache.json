At this point, it can only demo a simple telnet-style communication and access Wikipedia articles, but I am confident that I will showcase more in the future. For now, the interesting and surprisingly tricky part is how the thing works at all. Click the image to see the video on youtube.com. If you just want to see the cartridge in action or want to get into all the details, I highly recommend to watch the video first as it goes through the difficulties and their respective solutions. In contrast, this article here is less visual in its explanations and mostly documents the device in detail, so unless you are already familiar with the parallel memory interface of the Game Boy, you might want to start with the overview from the video.",

Starting with SCUMM I've always build my own.  I love the power and the freedom.  It's hard work and probably cost me more but I love making game engines and writing compilers.  It's a skill you slowly acquire and after the 5th one it's not a daunting task anymore.\nI ran into a programmer at an indie meet-up and she told me this story about how another programmer at her company brought up building their own game engine.

These two characters together made it rather difficult to want to keep reading their story, but I'm glad I did persevere.Although the story is a little cliche, around four fifths the way through the book, it does a pretty good job to win me over to the main characters and I want to see them happy by the end of the story.Probably a little bit too long, but worth it for the payoff at the end.",

I honestly did find the amount of sex in the book kind of over the top. I can buy that Kvothe is a legend character and one part of that is perhaps he has a reputation with women, but I'm not wholely sure I needed the many-month-long shagathon story when Kvothe is away with the faeries…\nStill, even with this, I found myself wanting to stay in the world for as long as I could.\nThe very ending, like the last few pages of The Name of the Wind did surprise me a left me a little confused, but I like to think that one day The Doors of Stone will answer some of those questions…",

I mean that in a good way! I think Web3 has resonated powerfully with young people because it feels like something genuinely new, and it feels like it can be theirs. Who could argue with those feelings? Not me.\n\nThe notes go on and I come away with the same general sense that I've had so far of the crowd cheering on for Web3: it's about making money. Which is fine, the world runs on capitalism for the most part, it's just not entirely for me.\nAnd I think that's the rub, the stories I know of the creation and the spread of the web (and indeed the internet) came from those wanting to share and do good. The stories I've read were never about making money but instead creating a place for others.\nI will concede that I don't tend to read the \"got rich by selling X web start up\" - but it's that start in the web that's what drives me, and what I love about the web. It's what I love about the Open Web.\nWeb Zero if you will. It was about sharing, community, learning and finding a place in the world.\nSource: society.robinsloan.com",

          "description": "I've told some stories about what happens when you end up at a company \nthat builds nothing and instead rents everything from some vendor.  \nGiven that, it's only fair that I describe something bad that can \nhappen at a company which is known for building stuff.\n\n\nThe trouble is that sometimes these companies will hire someone who's \nknown for doing X... and *only* X.  They're a builder, all right, as \nlong as you want them to build X.  Perhaps they have been building X at \nsome other company, and now your company has hired them to come and do \nthat same job over here instead.\n\n\nThere's also the possibility that the prestige of having this person \nworking at the company is what they're actually cultivating, and \nmanagement wants to make this person happy by letting them work on their \npet project, even if the pet project itself is not doing anything \npositive.\n\nactually belongs in \nproduction.  In one outcome, it's brilliantly executed and things grow.  \nBut, this is about the downsides, and in that scenario, it's a stinking \npile of garbage and needs to be thrown out, but it gets forced in, \nanyway.\n\n\nIf this project is being pushed for political reasons, then it should \nnot come as a surprise that when it finally does ship to production,\nit causes outages and generally fails to deliver on its promises.  It's \nactually worse than just leaving things the way they had been before any \nof this stuff showed up.\n\n\nJust imagine what companies would look like if their hiring processes \nfiltered out this kind of charlatan instead of looking for whether they \ncould do some dumb coding card trick in a 45 minute interview block.\nI think they'd look very different, and a whole bunch of people would \nhave to find another industry to prey upon.",

          "description": "In writing about my dumb little \"mailserv\" project this past weekend, I \npurposely avoided mentioning some of the parameters lest they distract \nfrom the message I was trying to convey.  My attempted message was \nsomething along the lines of \"everyone starts somewhere, ignorance is \nthe default state until changed, and look at some of the shit I have \ninflicted upon the world as proof\".\n\n\nIn the case of the mailserv project, that is, the thing that did what \nwe'd call \"greylisting\" today, it ran on an auxiliary box that itself \nonly existed because of yet another terrible hack involving a second T1 \nand the systemic inability to run BGP properly.  I've talked about the \nfiner points of that before, and it's not really on topic here.  But, \nkeep in mind that it meant from 1997 forward, I had a machine running \nSquid just so we could push some web traffic out this secondary \n(fractional) T1 to take the load off the main circuit.\n\n\nIt was relatively cheap shit, and it had no special \"server\" features.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's a Pentium 150 with 128 megabytes of memory, a (PATA!) IDE hard \ndrive with just 1.6 GB of space, a 10 Mbps Ethernet card, plus a video \ncard, CD-ROM drive and Sound Blaster that meant nothing, because it was \na server.  (The SB16, incidentally, proves this was intended to be a \nclassroom box running Kid Pix for some elementary school students.)\n\n\nAll of this in 128 MB of memory and a gig and a half of disk space.\n\n\nInstrumenting things to find slow points and trying to do something \nabout it made for a bunch of little changes over the year or two that \nthis spam filtering service existed.  Everything was driven by actual \nneeds and a distinct lack of system resources.  It kept up with the load \nand stopped a great many things that otherwise would have annoyed my \nusers.\n\nThis is just an example of what we did with what was available then.",

          "description": "Last November, I put up a\nlist\nof a bunch of \"magic numbers\" including some years in which time/date \nstuff is likely to break.  There's 2036 for the NTP era rollover, 2038 \nfor time_t requiring 32 bits in January *and* another GPS week rollover \nin November.\n\n\nLooking at the current year gives you a hint.  It's 2021, but another \nway of looking at that is that we're 121 years past the year 1900.  A \nfair number of things use(d) 1900 as an epoch, base year, or just an \noffset of sorts.  Why?  Well, they were probably invented in simpler \ntimes when the current year wasn't quite that far from 1900 at the time, \nand it would fit into fewer bits.  Specifically, it'll fit into just \nseven bits... until 2028, that is.\n\n\nSo, if someone used 1900 as their base year, stored years relative to \nthat, and then did it in just seven bits (or eight bits where one of \nthem is a sign bit), it'll overflow in a little over six years.  What \nhappens then depends on which method was used, and whether it applies \ncertain kinds of sanity checks.\n\n1773.  Neat!\n\n\nI originally spotted this thanks to a \nbug report type comment\non an epitaph (!) on HN.  That one is about ISO 9660 (CD/DVD stuff) \nsoftware and how it handles years.\n\nsimilar\nwas found in the Linux kernel in 2015 (and appears to have been \npatched).\n\nreference to this same problem\nthat might be useful if you're trying to keep your HP 3000 alive.  You \nknow, the things with the \n300+ lb disk drives?  \n(If you know, you know.)\n\n\nWikipedia does have 2028 in their epic\nlist\nof time formatting and storage bugs, naturally, but it only talks about \nsystems from the '70s.  It doesn't mention ISO 9660 at all - at the \nmoment, that is.  Perhaps someone in the know will update it and then \nthis comment will be obsolete.\n\n\n...\n\n\nEleven bits!  Luxury!  Ah, well, guess what happens in 2048?  Yep!\n\n\nFinally, one random thing for anyone who's not already aware: try\nlog2(n) to get a feel for how big a number is in binary.  Neat, right?",

It \nwas a reference to an Xtranormal video that someone created about the \nperils of trying to get your stuff running in production without having \nsomeone hate on you for \"doing it wrong\".\n\n\nWhen it came out, I took a screenshot of the long-suffering engineer \n(some kind of red panda/fox girl thing) and had a T-shirt made from it.  \nI wore it to work a few times to great effect.  It was our own little \ninternal joke within the company.\n\n\nReady?  \nHere it is.\n\n\nAs for everything in the video, it is really close to what the reality \nof production was back in the day.  Things were actually quite a bit \nworse than what it suggests, if you can believe it.  The whole thing \nabout \"get quota in two cells\" misses the fact that it was damn near \nimpossible to get the quota you needed across multiple services \n(compute, storage, ...) in the same place at the same time.\n\n\nSo, if you heard stories about software engineers doing shady deals to \ntrade quota between teams so they could get all of the stuff in the \nsame spot?  Yep, this is where those came from.  That's the kind of \nthing that was happening.
