The power receptacle appeared fine, but once we were ready to leave we found the male connection of our shore power cord had melted. Two out of three prongs were stuck in the receptacle. We've never had issues with our cord before, and for now we assume that the marina shore connection was faulty. Either way, we had to repair the power cord.\nWe always prefer to repair than to replace, so when we returned to a place with a marine store, we got ourselves replacements connections, both male and female, to replace the two damaged ends.\nWe thought we'd document the process of fixing a shower power cord.

The output of that script at first looked like it was a “false positive”. But some further investigation led me to learn something new about the prefers-color-scheme CSS user query.\n\nScott’s article includes a Codepen to demonstrate the output of the script.

Many have argued that it was unnecessary because we can use the ARIA search role and repurpose a form element to create the same semantics. I disagree.

          "description": "One of the fun things I used to do at a prior job was to dig through the \nraw data points which were collected from the *many* servers we had.  I \ncould just pick an interesting-sounding metric and then would just ask \nthe system to show me the top 10 or bottom 10 out of a population of \nthousands or more.\n\n\nTo get my feet wet with the whole \"investigations\" thing that we'd do, I \nstarted looking into this one day and chose one of the many temp sensors \nwhich were being logged by the servers.  I forget exactly which one it \nwas, for there were many.  The CPUs logged it, the chassis logged it, \nthe power supply logged it, and so on.  There were so many choices.\n\n\nI went looking for a reason.  What could possibly explain this?  First \noff, it didn't line up with any obvious pattern in the host names.  The \nhosts were named for whichever team owned them, followed by a sequence \nnumber that was bumped any time a new one was provisioned.  There was no \nsignal to be found in that.\n\n\nThere was more, though.  You could also see a \"rack position\" in this \ndata, and now it started getting interesting.  It seems that all of the \nreally hot machines had a rack position of something low, like 04 or 05, \nand never anything higher than that.  In fact, when looking at a whole \nrack, it was always the lowest number of all of the positions that were \nbeing used.  Now this was worth chasing!\n\n\nIt's good that I asked, since they told me something surprising: \nposition 04 or 05 or whatever was the *bottom* of the rack.  Yes, \nsomehow, the lowest machine in the rack was the hottest!  They found \nthis interesting, too, and wound up digging into it.  Given that I was \nfar away in a distant office, this was the best way for us to proceed.\n\n\nThe problem was that the bottommost server would have nothing below it \nbut just open space until it got to the floor.  That space would not \nmove air efficiently, and it obviously mattered.\n\n\nThis rolled out and my hot spots disappeared.  Fantastic!",

That is, it may not have been a matter of \n\"show X Y\" vs. \"clear X Y\", but rather some kind of automation that went \na bit too far.\n\n\nThen, what if you didn't have to actually type something in to hit the \nbutton?  Maybe you forgot, or something else happened, and you didn't \nfill it in, so when you did that, it said \"okay, cool then\" and \ndid all of them instead?\n\n\nGo to tool, don't type in target, hit button, ALL targets affected.\n\n\nIt sounds like another kind of \"footgun\" (you know, something you can \nuse to shoot yourself in the foot) from the world of databases: an \nUPDATE without a WHERE.\n\n\n\nUPDATE my_table SET invalid = true WHERE asset_id = 1012;\n\n\n\nImagine what happens when you forget the WHERE.  It's the last thing on \nthe line as shown, so you could send off the command early and it would \ntotally work.

In that case, maybe it would \nbe good if it said something like \"you are about to drain 123,456 \ndevices, so type in that exact number to proceed\".  You know,\nthat\nkind of thing.

In spite of this, it does not “feel” like work to see.
