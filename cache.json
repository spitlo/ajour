The power receptacle appeared fine, but once we were ready to leave we found the male connection of our shore power cord had melted. Two out of three prongs were stuck in the receptacle. We've never had issues with our cord before, and for now we assume that the marina shore connection was faulty. Either way, we had to repair the power cord.\nWe always prefer to repair than to replace, so when we returned to a place with a marine store, we got ourselves replacements connections, both male and female, to replace the two damaged ends.\nWe thought we'd document the process of fixing a shower power cord.

The output of that script at first looked like it was a “false positive”.

Many have argued that it was unnecessary because we can use the ARIA search role and repurpose a form element to create the same semantics. I disagree.

It is measured in volts (V).\n\n\nCURRENT is like the diameter of the hose. The wider it is, the more water will flow through.

          "description": "In 2008, Mark Changizi, a Sloan-Swartz Fellow in Theoretical Neuroscience at Caltech, noted that the eye can make sense of complex relationships that often mystify the brain. \n\r\n\r\nOur everyday visual perceptions rely upon unfathomably complex computations carried out by tens of billions of neurons across over half our cortex. In spite of this, it does not “feel” like work to see. Our cognitive powers are, in stark contrast, “slow and painful,” and we have great trouble with embarrassingly simple logic tasks. \n\r\nMight it be possible to harness our visual computational powers for other tasks, perhaps for tasks cognition finds difficult? \n\r\n\r\nIn other words, could we trick the eye into performing computation? \n\r\nChangizi proposed the Escher Circuit, \"a special kind of image that amounts to 'visual software' our 'visual hardware' computes\" merely through perception.\n\r\nEscher Circuits work by creating different states corresponding to how the eye resolves ambiguous images. Its core component, the wire, holds a state of 0 when we perceive it as if we are to the right of it; otherwise, it holds a state of 1.\n\r\n\nwire\n\r\n\n0\n\r\n\n1\n\r\n\r\n \nRead More",

Other Yoruba-speaking programmers contributed, along with some non-speakers who were excited about a programming language created by and for West Africans.\n\r\n\r\nOne of the major contributors to the projects is a guy from the Igbo tribe. He documented the architecture of the code, contributed helper functions to the language, and also made small sample programs using yorlang.\nRead More",

          "description": "Do you remember when having a great website was enough? Now, people are getting answers from Siri, Google search snippets, and mobile apps, not just our websites. Forward-thinking organizations have adopted an omnichannel content strategy, whose mission is to reach audiences across multiple digital channels and platforms.\nBut how do you set up a content management system (CMS) to reach your audience now and in the future? I learned the hard way that creating a content model—a definition of content types, attributes, and relationships that let people and systems understand content—with my more familiar design-system thinking would capsize my customer’s omnichannel content strategy. You can avoid that outcome by creating content models that are semantic and that also connect related content.…",

The intention to make our tech safer is not enough; we need a strategy.\nThis chapter will equip you with that plan of action. It covers how to integrate safety principles into your design work in order to create tech that’s safe, how to convince your stakeholders that this work is necessary, and how to respond to the critique that what we actually need is more diversity.

The project teamed up a group of random indie devs (provided by Indiepocalypse) with random comic artists (provided by kuš). The results are stellar! Even thecatamites worked on a game for it. I’m honored to be part of this! The person I was teamed up with is Gvidas Pakarklis, who is an amazing illustrator and artist. You can see more of his work on Instagram.
