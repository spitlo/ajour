This is a two part process.\n1. Capture current values from production:\nSELECT last_value FROM public.<table>_<col>_seq;\n\nSo for something like user ids, this would be:\nSELECT last_value FROM public.user_id_seq;\n>>> 304\n\nIf this doesn't yield a result, then the sequence name is wrong, and it can be checked with the following query:\nSELECT pg_get_serial_sequence('user', 'id');\n\nNow armed with this value, in my example 304, the next part is to upload locally:\n2. Update sequences locally:\nALTER SEQUENCE <table>_<col>_seq RESTART WITH <next_value>;\n\nIt's important that I update to the next value, not the current value:\nALTER SEQUENCE user_id_seq RESTART WITH 305;\n\nNow when the next id for the user is loaded through an insert, the sequences are in sync.",

It can run Spectrum (and the new Spectrum Next), C64, NES, Megadrive, SNES, PC Engine, Amiga 500, Vectrex, original arcade like Galaxian and Bubble Bobble and some more. To run the \"core\" it does require that someone has written the code to program the FPGA but there's a pretty good collection already available.",

Do you draw from these in designing your own languages? What are the most esoteric features you've found in non-esoteric languages? What do you consider the most non-intentionally-esoteric language?\n\r\nIt had been said that PostScript is both esoteric and non-esoteric at the same time. Additionally, I would think PostScript is both general-purpose and domain-specific at the same time, too.\nRead More",

          "description": "“Any comment?” is probably one of the worst ways to ask for feedback. It’s vague and open ended, and it doesn’t provide any indication of what we’re looking for. Getting good feedback starts earlier than we might expect: it starts with the request. \nIt might seem counterintuitive to start the process of receiving feedback with a question, but that makes sense if we realize that getting feedback can be thought of as a form of design research. In the same way that we wouldn’t do any research without the right questions to get the insights that we need, the best way to ask for feedback is also to craft sharp questions.\nDesign critique is not a one-shot process. Sure, any good feedback workflow continues until the project is finished, but this is particularly true for design because design wor…",

          "description": "Feedback, in whichever form it takes, and whatever it may be called, is one of the most effective soft skills that we have at our disposal to collaboratively get our designs to a better place while growing our own skills and perspectives.\nFeedback is also one of the most underestimated tools, and often by assuming that we’re already good at it, we settle, forgetting that it’s a skill that can be trained, grown, and improved. Poor feedback can create confusion in projects, bring down morale, and affect trust and team collaboration over the long term. Quality feedback can be a transformative force. \nPracticing our skills is surely a good way to improve, but the learning gets even faster when it’s paired with a good foundation that channels and focuses the practice.
