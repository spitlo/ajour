At least with the later you be giving a high school student a job.\nI really hope the TV writers can get something meaningful from the strike. I'm skeptical only because big companies taking advantage of creatives is burnt into their DNA. I see this all the time. Thimbleweed Park was the first game I ever saw anything from. I am getting something from RtMI but it's small. I've created a lot over the years and only made other people rich.\nI support the game industry unionizing, not only to create reasonable working hours, but also to stop companies from getting rich off our hard creative work. I don't think game writers should be part of the WGA, the businesses are too different, and I've seen the cluster fuck of Hollywood unions trying to get into games.\nUnions can also be their own oppressive mess but it's probably slightly better than what we have now.

Then managed to pick up a faulty \"Color\" model for £40 on eBay listed as not working.\nOn inspection it looked, internally, very clean - no corrosion or damage. From my experience with Pokémon Mini handhelds, I was wondering if perhaps the power button wasn't getting the signal.\nSo I applied a slice of kitchen tin foil, some sticky tape and voilà, it powers up! I had to also apply it to the sound and start button (and I'll probably make this permanent with conductive paint one day), but otherwise it's all good.\n(And I snagged a flash cart so I was able to experience some translated romhacks too)",

          "description": "Through the little Etsy store I've got, I offer Game Boy game repair mostly just so I get to \"play\" on different problems, and a different problem did arrive.\nThis Game Boy Advance game, although worked, requires a battery for the real time clock aspects of the game (i.e. timed events). The problem was that there was a repair attempt that had taken off the entire pad for the battery, and in fact had go through the pad, through the silk screen and had gone all the way into the fibre glass insulation layer (you might be able to see in the photo the woven pattern).\nBefore slapping a battery on and jumping the positive leg to the right component, I wanted to check that nothing else was missing. Thankfully the community have tried to preserve a lot of the history (in this case, the PCB traces) but also published it freely on the web.\nFrom this I also found a resistor had been lost in the previous repair. I don't think it's clear from my photo, but what I did was to bond the missing resistor in a completely different location (before it traces to a capacitor) and then use a jumper wire from the replaceable battery case. This was mostly in case the battery case was torn off again it wouldn't cause damage to the components on the board.\nOnce that was all done, the game happily had its clock and was returned to it's owner the same day.",

          "description": "Cutting to the chase: text editors *and* tabs vs. spaces!  Ooooh!\n\n\nI've had this thing called \"e\" for a while now.  It's a stupid little \nscript which serves to do a couple of things.  It starts my \neditor\nwith a given file, and it kicks it with the right arguments to make it \ndisable line wrapping and to make the [TAB] key actually put in two \nspaces.\n\n\nSo, my dumb script would use \"-w -E -T 2\" most of the time, except when it \nwas running on a Makefile, at which point it would skip those args.  \nSimple enough, right?\n\n\npico is back?  Yes indeed, on Macs, as of 12.3, pico is in fact back.  To \nmake sure I wasn't imagining things, I tracked down a machine that hadn't \nbeen upgraded yet and checked there.  Sure enough, it was in fact nano and \nnot pico.\n\n\nmacOS 12.3 has nano as a symlink... pointing to pico!\n\n\nAt some point, I switched from literal tab characters in my source code to \nblobs of spaces, probably due to using that style at work and not hating \nit.  So, somewhere along the line I actually started depending on nano \nbehavior without realizing it.\n\n\nAs for the lack of a feature in pico itself, it's kind of strange, really.  \nIf you go digging into the source, they have this random.c with a function \ncalled tab which claims to \"simulate tab stop\" using spaces.  That said, I \ncan't find any place where it would be called with the magic values which \nwould make it behave that way.\n\n\nIt wouldn't surprise me if this switch is just more of Apple removing \nGPLed things from their OS - pico seems to use the Apache license.  They \ndumped bash for zsh (MIT license) at some point (Big Sur, I think), and \nnow this?  Okay then.",

          "description": "Here's a very old and stupid trick you could do with some filesystems in \nsome situations back in the day... and might still be able to do in a \nfew places today.\n\n\nThe problem is that while version X might eventually have an exploit, \nit'll get removed and it'll be replaced by version Y without that\nparticular hole.  By the time you get your hands on a tool to break into \nX, it'll be gone.\n\n\nWhat you'd do is create a hard link pointing at the file you wanted to \npreserve, storing it in a spot which was writable by your account.  \nThen, say, /usr/bin/sudo (because that never has security \nissues...) gets replaced at some point with a new file and you get to \nkeep the old version.  When you get the tool to pop it, off you go!\n\n\nOf course, these days, it's not quite so easy on the more modern systems \nyou find.  Debian 11 here won't let me do it - it's EPERM city.  Rocky 8 \n(so CentOS 8 and RHEL 8 too) also won't do it.  They both have some gunk\nin /usr/lib/sysctl.d to lock this down.  But, my old Slackware 14.2 \ninstall of my workstation let me do it the last time I tried about \na year ago.  How about that, huh?  I bet it'd still work if I dug out \nthe old drives and booted them up.\n\n\nIncidentally, this is the magic sauce: /proc/sys/fs/protected_hardlinks\nRead the man page for proc(5) to learn more about it.\n\nhere it is,\nthe thread I read a long time ago.  It's interesting to note that as far \nas I can tell, nothing actually changed upstream.  This left paranoid \nadmins like me with no option but to use the (most excellent) Openwall \npatches to lock down this kind of stuff.  I used that on my machines at \nwork which had non-staff users... just in case.\n\n\nThis whole situation is scary.  \nRead more about it.",

          "description": "One of the fun things I used to do at a prior job was to dig through the \nraw data points which were collected from the *many* servers we had.  I \ncould just pick an interesting-sounding metric and then would just ask \nthe system to show me the top 10 or bottom 10 out of a population of \nthousands or more.\n\n\nTo get my feet wet with the whole \"investigations\" thing that we'd do, I \nstarted looking into this one day and chose one of the many temp sensors \nwhich were being logged by the servers.  I forget exactly which one it \nwas, for there were many.  The CPUs logged it, the chassis logged it, \nthe power supply logged it, and so on.  There were so many choices.\n\n\nI went looking for a reason.  What could possibly explain this?  First \noff, it didn't line up with any obvious pattern in the host names.  The \nhosts were named for whichever team owned them, followed by a sequence \nnumber that was bumped any time a new one was provisioned.  There was no \nsignal to be found in that.\n\n\nThere was more, though.  You could also see a \"rack position\" in this \ndata, and now it started getting interesting.  It seems that all of the \nreally hot machines had a rack position of something low, like 04 or 05, \nand never anything higher than that.  In fact, when looking at a whole \nrack, it was always the lowest number of all of the positions that were \nbeing used.  Now this was worth chasing!\n\n\nIt's good that I asked, since they told me something surprising: \nposition 04 or 05 or whatever was the *bottom* of the rack.  Yes, \nsomehow, the lowest machine in the rack was the hottest!  They found \nthis interesting, too, and wound up digging into it.  Given that I was \nfar away in a distant office, this was the best way for us to proceed.\n\n\nThe problem was that the bottommost server would have nothing below it \nbut just open space until it got to the floor.  That space would not \nmove air efficiently, and it obviously mattered.\n\n\nThis rolled out and my hot spots disappeared.  Fantastic!",

In short, it looks like every Raspberry Pi filesystem installed \nfrom any given release image probably ends up with the same\nUUID.\n\n\nFor instance, if you downloaded the \"lite\" version of Raspbian between \nroughly November 8th and January 28th, you probably got a file called \n2021-10-30-raspios-bullseye-armhf-lite.zip.  Inside, there's an image, \nand the idea is that you dump that straight to your SD card, cram it in \nthe Pi, and off you go.  The second partition on that image is an ext4 \nfilesystem which was created on some build machine somewhere.  The UUID \non it never gets \"evolved\" to something else after the install.\n\n\nYou can see it inside the image itself here:\n\n\nOr, if you actually installed a few of these things like I did over the \npast couple of months, you can just 'tune2fs -l /dev/mmcblk0p2' and see \nthe same value in there.\n\n\nDon't end up with a pile of SD cards on your desk and think \"I know, \nI'll use the filesystem UUIDs to track which one goes where\", in other \nwords.\n\n\nIf it's not breaking anything for you, it's probably best to just let it \nbe.  Untangling a boot mess on these weird little boxes is anything but \nfun.\n\nNote: if you're actually on a recent Raspberry Pi, odds are good that \nyour /etc/fstab will be using *partition* UUIDs (PARTUUID=...) and not \nthose of the filesystem.  If in doubt, use blkid to see what's what.",

There was an American flag hanging at the front of the classroom and on the first morning, the teacher said, \"We're going begin every morning with the pledge of allegiance to the flag. I will teach it to you and you are to memorize that.\" But I could see right outside my schoolhouse window the barbed wire fence and the sentry tower as I recited the words \"with liberty and justice for all\". An innocent kid, too young to understand the stinging irony in those words.\n\n\nTakei has done many talks & interviews over the years about his experience, including for the Archive of American Television, Democracy Now!, and a TED Talk back in 2014:\n\nHe also published a graphic novel about his time in the camps called They Called Us Enemy.\nTags: George Takei · interviews · racism · Star Trek · TV · USA · video · war · World War II",

Here's Minkov explaining his full-galactic view:\nI've always wondered what the night sky would look like if we could see the two Milky Way arches from the winter and summer side by side. This is practically impossible, since they are part of a whole and are visible at different times of the day.\nHowever, this 360-degree time-blended panorama shows us what they would look like. The two arches of the Milky Way represent one object in the starry sky, with part of it visible in winter and part of it in summer. Therefore, they are called the winter and summer arches. The winter arch includes objects that we can observe from October to March, primarily associated with the constellation Orion.\nOn the other hand, the summer arch features the Milky Way core, visible from March to September, which is the most characteristic and luminous part of the night sky, representing the center of our galaxy.\n\n\n Tags: astronomy · best of · best of 2023 · Milky Way · photography",

          "description": "Ok this is kind of incredible: Brick Technology built a solar-powered Lego clock that will keep time for a billion years. It's got various displays in the style of an astronomical clock so you can keep track of seconds, hours, months, centuries, and even galactical years (the amount of time the Sun takes to orbit the center of the galaxy). The clock is powered by solar energy, and the solar cell is connected to the clock so that it tilts throughout the day to keep facing the sun. \nThis is a) an extremely accessible explanation of how clocks work, b) the nerdiest thing ever, and c) I love it so much. Even if you're not a Lego fan, you should watch this. (For more on how clocks work, check out Bartosz Ciechanowski's excellent explainer on mechanical watches.)\nThe obvious thing that sprung to mind watching this was The Clock of the Long Now, a 10,000-year clock being constructed inside a mountain in West Texas. But I also thought of Arthur Ganson's Machine With Concrete, which utilizes extreme gear ratios to turn an input of 200 rpm into a gear that turns only once every 2 trillion years. That's slow enough that the final gear is actually embedded in concrete and it doesn't affect the operation of the machine at all.\n\nSee also Here's What a Googol-to-One Gear Ratio Looks Like, 20 Mechanical Principles Combined in a Useless Lego Machine, and A Lego 5-Speed Manual Transmission.\nTags: Lego · time · video",

          "description": "In 2015, artist Olafur Eliasson designed the Circle Bridge (Cirkelbroen) to span a canal in central Copenhagen. The pedestrian bridge was designed to slow people down a bit:\nThe bridge is made of five circular platforms, and it contributes to a larger circle that will form a pedestrian route around Copenhagen Harbour, where people — cycling, running, walking — can see the city from a very different perspective. As many as 5,000 people will cross this bridge each day. I hope that these people will use Cirkelbroen as a meeting place, and that the zigzag design of the bridge will make them reduce their speed and take a break. To hesitate on our way is to engage in bodily thought. I see such introspection as an essential part of a vibrant city.\n\n\nSmall boats can travel easily under the bridge but a section of the bridge also swings gracefully away to let larger boats pass.

          "description": "In a Memorial Day reflection, historian Heather Cox Richardson highlights a pamphlet distributed by the US War Department to Army soldiers during World War II on the topic of fascism: what it is and how to combat it.\nThe War Department thought it was important for Americans to understand the tactics fascists would use to take power in the United States. They would try to gain power \"under the guise of 'super-patriotism' and 'super-Americanism.'\" And they would use three techniques:\nFirst, they would pit religious, racial, and economic groups against one another to break down national unity. Part of that effort to divide and conquer would be a \"well-planned 'hate campaign' against minority races, religions, and other groups.\"\nSecond, they would deny any need for international cooperation, because that would fly in the face of their insistence that their supporters were better than everyone else. \"In place of international cooperation, the fascists seek to substitute a perverted sort of ultra-nationalism which tells their people that they are the only people in the world who count. With this goes hatred and suspicion toward the people of all other nations.\"\nThird, fascists would insist that \"the world has but two choices — either fascism or communism, and they label as 'communists' everyone who refuses to support them.\"\nIt is \"vitally important\" to learn to spot native fascists, the government said, \"even though they adopt names and slogans with popular appeal, drape themselves with the American flag, and attempt to carry out their program in the name of the democracy they are trying to destroy.\"\n\n\nSee also The 14 Features of Eternal Fascism, How Fascism Works, Toni Morrison's Ten Steps Towards Fascism, and Fighting Authoritarianism: 20 Lessons from the 20th Century.\nTags: Heather Cox Richardson · politics · USA",

The telescope is still in a \"learning and transitioning period\" and not up to full operational speed, but scientists at the National Solar Observatory recently released a batch of images that hint at what it's capable of. Several of the photos feature sunspots, cooler regions of the Sun with strong magnetic fields.\nThe sunspots pictured are dark and cool regions on the Sun's \"surface\", known as the photosphere, where strong magnetic fields persist. Sunspots vary in size, but many are often the size of Earth, if not larger. Complex sunspots or groups of sunspots can be the source of explosive events like flares and coronal mass ejections that generate solar storms. These energetic and eruptive phenomena influence the outermost atmospheric layer of the Sun, the heliosphere, with the potential to impact Earth and our critical infrastructure.\nIn the quiet regions of the Sun, the images show convection cells in the photosphere displaying a bright pattern of hot, upward-flowing plasma (granules) surrounded by darker lanes of cooler, down-flowing solar plasma. In the atmospheric layer above the photosphere, called the chromosphere, we see dark, elongated fibrils originating from locations of small-scale magnetic field accumulations.\n\n\n(via petapixel)\nTags: astronomy · Inouye Solar Telescope · science · space · Sun",

          "description": "Hand Talk sign language has been used by indigenous communities for thousands of years as a lingua franca between groups and tribes that didn't share a common spoken language. Hand Talk is an endangered endangered — the US government tried to eradicate indigenous languages starting the late 1800s — but it's still in use today.\nThis was fascinating. For example, as with all languages, Hand Talk vocabulary reveals how they thought about everyday concepts like time:\nFor example, let's take the simple question: \"How old are you?\" First, there's a single sign for \"question.\" So for a question about someone's age, you'd use the motion for question with the motion for \"winter\". How many winters are you? That's what I ask. In PISL you measure months by moons, days by the sun. And to refer to different times of day, you would show hand placement according to the position of the sun in the sky. So this sign for morning, afternoon, or night.\n\n\nHand Talk was also one of the influences on ASL and the borrowing of vocabulary between the two language groups continues.\nTags: language · Native Americans · video",

In the process, they missed World War II, the Moon landing, and the start of the Cold War.\n...beside a stream there was a dwelling. Blackened by time and rain, the hut was piled up on all sides with taiga rubbish-bark, poles, planks. If it hadn't been for a window the size of my backpack pocket, it would have been hard to believe that people lived there. But they did, no doubt about it.... Our arrival had been noticed, as we could see.\nThe low door creaked, and the figure of a very old man emerged into the light of day, straight out of a fairy tale. Barefoot. Wearing a patched and repatched shirt made of sacking. He wore trousers of the same material, also in patches, and had an uncombed beard. His hair was disheveled. He looked frightened and was very attentive.... We had to say something, so I began: 'Greetings, grandfather! We've come to visit!'\nThe old man did not reply immediately.... Finally, we heard a soft, uncertain voice: 'Well, since you have traveled this far, you might as well come in.'\n\n\t\nSuper fascinating.

Hidden behind the painting was an envelope containing a copy of the Declaration of Independence. It turned out to be one of approximately 200 copies of the Dunlap broadside, the first published copies of the historic document. From a contemporary NY Times article:\nMr. Redden described the document, found behind the painting when the collector took the frame apart, as an \"unspeakably fresh copy\" of the declaration. \"The fact that it has been in the backing of the frame preserved it,\" he said. Of the 24 copies known to survive, only 3 are in private hands, he added.\n\n\nHow \"unspeakably fresh\" was this particular copy? The ink wasn't yet dry when it was folded into the envelope:\n\"The ink was still wet on this copy when it was folded,\" Mr. Kiffer said. \"The very first line — 'In Congress, July 4, 1776' — shows up in the bottom margin in reverse, as a faint offsetting or shadow printing, one more proof of the urgency John Dunlap, the printer, and others felt in dispersing this document.\"\n\n\nThe document sold for $2.2 million in 1991 and then sold again in 2000 for $7.4 million to legendary TV producer Norman Lear (All in the Family, The Jeffersons), who mounted a three-and-a-half year tour of the it across the US.

A crew from the BBC recently made a short video tour, where you can see books on shelves designed to display fine china, an absence of windows, escalators, a lack of floor-to-ceiling walls, and fashion branding that remains on the walls.\nAlexandra Lange wrote about the school in 2021 for Curbed.\nThe genre may be nearly dead, yet the building remains. And for economic, ecological, and social reasons, those buildings should be reused. \"It's amazing to think that we are standing in what used to be a department store; that we're greeting people where we used to buy winter coats; reading books where they once sold fine china; taking phone calls in converted changing rooms; and learning science in the old suit racks,\" Burlington's school superintendent, Tom Flanagan, said at the ceremony. A school in a department store doesn't have to be a sad story. In fact, this should just be the beginning, both for the students and for a country once addicted to big boxes.\n\n\nVermont indie newspaper Seven Days published a writeup, video tour, and photo slideshow of the school when it opened two years ago.\nTags: Alexandra Lange · education · Vermont · video",

(Colloquially, it is often referred to as Ozempic, though that is technically just the brand name for semaglutide that is marketed for diabetes treatment.) Her food thoughts quieted down. She lost weight. But most surprisingly, she walked out of Target one day and realized her cart contained only the four things she came to buy. \"I've never done that before,\" she said.

It's based on the fantastic book by David Grann, Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI.\nIn the 1920s, the richest people per capita in the world were members of the Osage Nation in Oklahoma. After oil was discovered beneath their land, the Osage rode in chauffeured automobiles, built mansions, and sent their children to study in Europe.\nThen, one by one, the Osage began to be killed off. The family of an Osage woman, Mollie Burkhart, became a prime target. One of her relatives was shot. Another was poisoned. And it was just the beginning, as more and more Osage were dying under mysterious circumstances, and many of those who dared to investigate the killings were themselves murdered.\n\n\nThe movie will be out in theaters on October 6. Oh, and Scorsese & DiCaprio have already signed on to adapt Grann's latest book, The Wager, which I recently read and loved.\nTags: books · David Grann · Killers of the Flower Moon · Leonardo DiCaprio · Martin Scorsese · movies · trailers · video",

Today that figure is about 11%. And this decline wasn't just in the US — you can find the same trend in Australia, England, and Canada: today the majority of students are driven to school in a car. One of the larger studies we have on this issue in [British Columbia] found that 58% of 4th graders and 50% of 7th graders were driven to school by their parents.\n\n\nThere are various reasons for this shift, including that roads are unsafe for cyclists and pedestrians because of cars, a cultural shift towards greatly increased parental supervision of children, and inflexible parental work schedules.\nTags: cars · video",

The more that your eyes adjust, the more saturated the blue gets. It's a surreal visual experience that you cannot get from any photo of an ice cave.\"\n\n\nIf you'd like to see some of these places for yourself, Newburn runs a tour company called Ice Pic Journeys.\nTags: Iceland · photography · Ryan Newburn",

People choose to drop out of their lives for different reasons, ranging from debt or abuse to mental health struggles or a lack of second chances in Japanese society. Some Japanese who want to go into hiding or relocate from domestic abuse or stalkers hire \"night movers\" to help them disappear.\nFor more info, here's a long piece from Time magazine from 2017.\nSometimes a whole team works on a client's disappearance, swiftly sweeping through an apartment in the dead of night. At TS, it costs between ¥50,000 ($450) and ¥300,000 ($2,600) depending on the amount of possessions somebody wants to flee with, how far they're going, and whether the move needs to happen under the cover of darkness. Taking along children, or evading debt collectors, can push prices higher. Every day, TS receives between five and 10 inquiries like the one Saita described. Most people simply require counseling or legal advice but the company claims to help between 100 and 150 people to vanish annually.\n\n\n Tags: Japan · video",

Scientists had known for years that mRNA had immense potential as a delivery platform for vaccines, but before SARS-CoV-2 appeared, they hadn't had quite the means or urgency to move the shots to market. And research into vaccines against other viruses, such as RSV and MERS, had already offered hints about the sorts of genetic modifications that might be needed to stabilize the coronavirus's spike protein into a form that would marshal a strong, lasting immune response.\n\n\n Tags: Covid-19 · lists · medicine · science · USA",

          "description": "In this short film by Sarah Klein & Tom Mason, Christen O'Brien tells the story of how she almost died from a massive pulmonary embolism, what she experienced in those moments, and what she took from the experience. The film is based on an essay she wrote called What It Felt Like to Almost Die.1\nRealizing that I was dying was like being pushed into a pool. You have no thought but to hold your breath and start swimming. It was the most out of control I'd ever been in my life, yet the only option was to succumb peacefully. I could hear the percussion of my heart beating wildly, recklessly. My breath only reached my trachea now, its pathway closing in rapidly. My palms spread open to the sky, just as my dog moved to stand over me. I am here with you, I am here to protect you.\n\n\nO'Brien wrote a follow-up to her original post, How It Felt to Come Back to Life:\nComing back from death showed me that the journey of life is not what we often believe. On the surface, it appears as a journey outward — toward things, people, organizations, achievements. But in truth, it is a journey inward — toward the soul. Toward becoming who you actually are, no matter how far outward you may have to travel in order to discover that all the answers are within you, where you belong.\n\n\n\nThe filmmakers first read O'Brien's story via a link from kottke.org. It doesn't happen that often, but I love it when things I feature go on to inspire others to create things of their own. Just doing my bit to complete the loop.↩\n\nTags: Christen O'Brien · death · Sarah Klein · Tom Mason · video",

SineRider, a project started by Chris Walker and finished by a group of teen hackers at Hack Club, is a version of Line Rider where you use math equations to draw curves to maneuver the sledder through a series of points, sometimes in a certain order. Here's a trailer with some gameplay examples:\n\nLet me tell you, I haven't had this much fun mucking around with an online game/toy since I don't know when. My math is super rusty, but SineRider eases you into the action with some simple slopes (no cosines or tangents necessary) and before you know it, it's 20 minutes later and you're googling equations for parabolas.\nRight now, there are two ways to play. You can start on the front page and go through a progression of puzzles that get more challenging as more concepts are introduced (such as the curve changing over time). Or you can do the challenges, which are posted daily to Twitter or Reddit. My son and I spent 10-15 minutes solving these two challenges and we were laughing and cheering when we finally got them. (The educational opportunity here is obvious...)\nSineRider is currently in beta so some of the UI stuff is a little rough around the edges, but I was really charmed by the music, the animations...everything really. The project is open source — the code is available on GitHub and the Hack Club folks are looking for contributors and collaborators:\nThere's a reason it's open-source and written in 100% vanilla JavaScript. We need volunteer artists, writers, programmers, and puzzle designers. And, if you're a smart teenager who wants to change education for the better, you should come join Hack Club!\n\n\n Tags: mathematics · SineRider · video · video games",

Xane was the best Meta Knight player in the midwest during the height of his Super Smash Bros. career. She asked him what a $250,000 prize pool was. After he explained that first place got half of the total pool, he asked why. \"I'm in the semifinals accidentally,\" she wrote.\n\n\nIn that vein, a reader sent me a link to this 2007 Boston Globe piece about a woman who discovers that she's actually the world's best Tetris player.\n\"It's funny,\" I told Flewin. \"We have an old Nintendo Game Boy floating around the house, and Tetris is the only game we own. My wife will sometimes dig it out to play on airplanes and long car rides. She's weirdly good at it. She can get 500 or 600 lines, no problem.\"\nWhat Flewin said next I will never forget.\n\"Oh, my!\"\nAfter I hung up the phone, I went to the bedroom and woke my wife, Lori.\n\"Honey,\" I said. \"You're not going to believe this, but I just got off the phone with a guy who's in charge of video game world records, and he said the world record for Game Boy Tetris is 327 lines, and he wants us to go to New Hampshire this spring so you can try to break the world record live in front of the judges at the world's largest classic video game tournament.\n\n\nSpoiler alert: she broke the record. Baker is still 5th on the all-time scoring list but her score was bested just three months later by Harry Hong, the original record holder, who achieved a score six times higher than Baker's.

There is no regard for due process. People who deem themselves judge, jury and executioner walk among us, and we have no real way of knowing when they will turn on us.\nI will be thinking about Jordan Neely in particular for a long time. I will be thinking about who gets to stand his ground, who doesn't, and how, all too often, it's people in the latter group who are buried beneath that ground by those who refuse to cede dominion over it. Every single day there are news stories that are individually devastating and collectively an unequivocal condemnation of what we are becoming: a people without empathy, without any respect for the sanctity of life unless it's our own.\n\n\nThe whole piece is worth reading and sitting with.\nTags: crime · guns · murder · Roxane Gay · USA",

Greenwood stutters, to the extent that verbal conversation is difficult. When he tries to resolve an issue with a service representative over the phone, he can't get the words out; the operator, gruff and impatient, hangs up. (For surliness, she rivals the operator in the old Yaz song.) When a woman approaches Greenwood on the street, he uses sign language to avoid talking. But in his thoughts, which we hear, he does not stutter.\n\n\t\nGreat little film...my heart broke three separate times watching it.\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n[This was originally posted on October 19, 2016.]\nTags:Benjamin Cleary    \ncrying at work    \nlanguage    \nOscars    \nvideo",

          "description": "Microsoft Excel is an extremely powerful, complex, and useful software program that millions of people know how to use, at least a little bit. For those who are experts, there are now esports competitions in Microsoft Excel that pit the best spreadsheet jockeys against each other. Here's what that looks like:\n\nIt's....a little confusing to watch if you aren't that good at Excel yourself. From a piece in the Atlantic late last year:\nYes, we are talking about people competing in Microsoft Excel, the famous (and famously boring) spreadsheet software that you may have used in school or at work or to track your finances. In competitive Excel, players square off in test-taking showdowns, earning points each time they answer a question correctly. Players' screens are a whirlwind of columns and keystrokes and formulae; if the terms XLOOKUP, RANDBETWEEN, and dynamic array don't mean anything to you, you are unlikely to understand what's going on. The commentators help, but only to a point. Even so, you can always follow the scoreboard, which tends to change suddenly and drastically. With just over three minutes to play, Ngai nailed a set of questions and jumped out to a 416-390 lead. GolferMike1 began to rethink his earlier assessment: \"Uh oh. We got a game.\"\n\n\nThere's a pretty good explanation of what some of the challenges are like starting at the 6-minute mark in this video:\n\nIf you'd like more information, check out the Microsoft Excel World Championship for 2023 — the finals are in Las Vegas this year, they're gonna show it on one of ESPN's channels, and there's more than $15,000 in prize money at stake.\nTags: Excel · sports · video",

It happens in nature when huge volcanic eruptions cover the stratosphere with ash: That ash forms a layer that reflects sunlight and cools the planet underneath. Solar geoengineering takes advantage of that principle, using different scientific methods to make the planet more reflective overall. The problem is, deploying it would require messing with our very complicated climate on a massive scale, and many scientists don't think the risks are worth it.\n\n\n Tags: climate crisis · science · video",

But it's fascinating what happens. The crowd, being a crowd, does not initially do what it should, which is rush the experts and take them out right away with little regard for individual survival. But pretty much every person fights for themselves. And instead of getting easier for the Musketeers near the end, it gets more difficult. The few remaining crowd members start working together more effectively. The survival of the fittest effect kicks in. The remaining experts get sloppy, tired, and perhaps a little overconfident. The ending was a genuine shock. (via digg)\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n[This was originally posted on May  1, 2014.]\nTags:fencing    \nsports    \nTV    \nvideo",

Brought to Cuba as laborers, these migrants and their Cuban-Chinese progeny developed a cuisine that blended Chinese and Caribbean flavors.\nAfter the Cuban Revolution in 1959, many Cuban Chinese left the island and some established Cuban Chinese food restaurants in the United States, mainly in New York City and Miami. Some diners contend that Cuban-Chinese food is more Cuban than Chinese.\nThere are also other genres of Chinese-Latin and Asian-Latin food blends created by Asian migrants to Latin America over the last two centuries.\n\n\nSee also Chinese Latinos Explain Chino-Latino Food and from The Village Voice in 2014, The Definitive Guide to NYC’s Chinese-Latin American Restaurants, many of which, like La Dinastia, are still around.\nTags: food · NYC · restaurants · video",

Carving is all about having deep cuts here and lighter here and the angle here and how the light plays on it. And certainly in relief...because relief carving like this, it's kind of halfway between sculpture and drawing. If you're doing a three-dimensional sculpture, if a form runs around the back you just carve it so it goes around the back, but with this you have to give the illusion of it running around the back like a drawing. You've got to make something look like it turns around and comes out the other side even though it really is just going into the block. And that's all about angles and shadow and light.\n\n\n Tags: art · Donatello · how to · Simon Smith · video",

David Popa uses natural pigments to draw large format portraits on fractured sheets of ice and then photographs them from above. Wow, wow, wow. From a profile of Popa’s work at Colossal:\nBecause many of his works are destined to melt and be reabsorbed, Popa opts for natural materials like white chalk from the Champagne region, ochres from France and Italy, and powdered charcoal he makes himself-the latter also plays a small role in purifying the water, leaving it cleaner than the artist found it. Most pieces take between three and six hours to complete, and his work time is dependent on the weather, temperature, and condition of the sea. “The charcoal will sink into the ice and disappear from a very dark shade to a medium shade, so it has to be created very quickly and documented. No to mention the work on the ice will just crack and drift away completely, or the next day it will snow and be completely covered,” he says. “I’m really battling the elements.”\n\n\nI love these so much — they remind me of self-portraits taken in shattered mirrors or fragmented mirrored surfaces, a practice I apparently engage in with some regularity.\nTags: art   David Popa   photography",

This is a live recording of a song by the jazz fusion band Snarky Puppy and — hold on, before you wander off having heard that collection of words, let me preface this by saying that I am not really a jam band person or a jazz fusion person and I thought this was pretty amazing.\nSo anyway, legend has it that Snarky Puppy were all set to record a live record in Holland and their regular drummer couldn’t make it, so they called Lewis to fill in. He learns the music on the plane ride over to Europe and — what? yeah, he learned the music on the plane ride over and then when he gets there…just watch the video above to see what happens.\nI admit I didn’t quite get what was so special about this at first, but around the 4:20 mark things really start to get interesting and by the end I was grinning like an idiot. Cory Henry does the keyboard solo and Lewis backs him on it like they’ve been playing together for three lifetimes. As one of the YouTube commenters put it:\nI just discovered this about 2 hours ago… I’ve been a musician for 20+ years… After watching this performance, I’ve now been a musician for about 2 hours.\n\n\n(via @caleb, who noted the many reactions to this video on YouTube)\nTags: Larnell Lewis   music   Snarky Puppy   video",

This morning, I featured a video of Lewis, a Grammy-winning musician and music professor, explaining the 13 levels of complexity of drumming. In response, a pair of readers sent me this video, in which Lewis hears Metallica’s Enter Sandman for the first time (!) and then largely succeeds in playing it after a single listen (!!). You may find yourself wanting to skip to the part where he starts playing, but it’s really fascinating to watch him encoding the music into his brain and body through a combination of active listening, moving his body to the drumbeat, and spatially mapping the music to his drum kit.

Larnell Lewis is a Grammy Award-winning musician and a professor of music at Humber College in Toronto and his tour of the 13 levels of drumming, from easy to complex, is super clear, entertaining, and informative. Aside from the names of some of the drum kit pieces, I did not know a damn thing about drumming before watching this and now my eyes have been opened to how amazing drummers are to be able to do all of that (and look cool as hell at the same time). Like, I can’t even comprehend how they keep all those rhythms going at the same time…it just seems like magic to me.

Without the Lisa, there would have been no Macintosh — at least in the form we have it today — and perhaps there would have been no Microsoft Windows either.\n\n\nThe video above from Adi Robertson at The Verge is a good introduction to the Lisa and what made it so simultaneously groundbreaking and unpopular. From a companion article:\nTo look at the Lisa now is to see a system still figuring out the limits of its metaphor. One of its unique quirks, for instance, is a disregard for the logic of applications. You don’t open an app to start writing or composing a spreadsheet; you look at a set of pads with different types of documents and tear off a sheet of paper.\nBut the office metaphor had more concrete technical limits, too. One of the Lisa’s core principles was that it should let users multitask the way an assistant might, allowing for constant distractions as people moved between windows. It was a sophisticated idea that’s taken for granted on modern machines, but at the time, it pushed Apple’s engineering limits - and pushed the Lisa’s price dramatically upward.\n\n\nAnd from 1983, a demo video from Apple on how the Lisa could be used in a business setting:\n\nAnd a more characteristically Apple ad for the Lisa featuring a pre-stardom Kevin Costner:\n\nTags: Adi Robertson   Apple   Kevin Costner   Lisa   computing   video",

As historian and archaeologist Ian Morris says in the video, the five factors that crop up throughout history when a major societal collapse occurs seem to be present today: mass migrations, epidemic disease, collapse of states, major famines, and climate change. So, how should we think about the potential impending disintegration of society? How should we prepare? How should we feel about it?\nIn this short film, filmmaker Ryan Malloy explores, in a “fretful yet lighthearted” way, how one should prepare for the apocalypse by talking to a historian & archaeologist (the aforementioned Morris), a therapist, and a couple of different types of preppers.\nPutting together a supply kit made me realize just how helpless I’d be if disaster struck. When you think about it, it’s almost like we live in a world run by magic. I don’t know how water, electricity, and gas gets to my house, but they’ve always been there. It wouldn’t take much, even just a small crisis for them to be gone. What would it be like to live without these things?\n\n\n Tags: Ian Morris   Ryan Malloy   video",

Even since 2009, solar has declined 90% in price. So what’s behind that incredible drop? Industry played a part but the main driver was forward-thinking government policy and subsidy of solar by countries like the US, Japan, Germany, and China:\nIn the course of a single lifetime, solar energy has transformed from a niche technology to the cheapest way to bring clean, reliable power to billions of people around the world. But the markets that brought us these lower prices didn’t just magically appear by some invisible hand. Political leaders in countries all over the world created these markets, then subsidized them for decades to the tune of billions of dollars. “By investing that money, you got the solar to come down in costs to the point where you don’t need to subsidize it anymore.”\n\n\nOne of the experts in the video, Gregory Nemet, is the author of a book called How Solar Energy Became Cheap: A Model for Low-Carbon Innovation if you’d like to read more on the development of solar.\nTags: climate crisis   energy   video",

Bruising the skin speeds up the process, a fact that Anna Chojnicka exploits to create these bruised banana artworks (also on Instagram). Here’s how it works:\nI bruise the peel by pressing into it lightly with a blunt point. Speeding up and controlling the bruising process conjures light and shade in the image.\nOver a few hours, the mark gradually goes darker until black. I start with the darkest parts of the image first, and then work my way backwards, finishing with the lightest parts last. \nBy managing the timing, it’s possible to make intricate images with graduating shades. There’s a short window of time when the image looks its best; I photograph the banana, and then eat it.\n\n\nChojnicka started the project in the early days of the pandemic while bored/delirious at home with a suspected Covid infection. The increase in art using found objects during the pandemic is fascinating: people couldn’t spend a lot of time out of the house, so they reached for whatever they could find to express their creativity…in this case, bananas.\nTags: Anna Chojnicka   art   food",

Schang collected the calling cards of prominent artists and musicians and in the late 20th century, donated a collection of them to Met Museum.\nCalling cards derived from a custom, originating in England, in which messages were inscribed on the backs of playing cards. Cards made for the express purpose of sharing hand-written messages were manufactured beginning in the eighteenth century; by the early-nineteenth century, calling cards had become a popular means for sending well wishes, holiday greetings, condolences, and messages of courtship.\n\n\nThe cards include those of Klee, Renoir, Pissarro, Rodin, Monet, Mondrian, Braque, Toulouse-Lautrec, Manet, and many more. I think my favorites are Piet Mondrian’s (above) and Joan Miró’s, the former because it’s very much in keeping with the artist’s style and the latter because it isn’t:\n\nSchang published a book of these cards in 1983 — it’s long out of print but you can get one here (signed, no less).

The total fee was $145.29 (see the meter machine tapes). Postage only amounted to $2.44 for the package which weighed 61 ounces.

But despite becoming so familiar, it remained a mystery for most of us. What do these sounds mean?\nAs many already know, what you’re hearing is often called a handshake, the start of a telephone conversation between two modems. The modems are trying to find a common language and determine the weaknesses of the telephone channel originally meant for human speech.\n\n\nSee also this other visualization of dialup sounds, opera singers dubbed with dialup modems, and a vocal arrangement of the modem handshake.\nTags: audio   infoviz   Oona Raisanen",

As Phil Edwards explains in this entertaining video, the answer can be boiled down to two words: innovation and marketing.\nThe first Lego plastic mold was the same one that Kiddicraft used, and early Lego bricks were almost identical to Kiddicraft blocks, with a few minor differences. They slightly changed the scale and the studs, but as you can see, they were pretty similar. Early Kiddicraft blocks had little slots in the side for windows and other attachments. So did early Lego bricks. From top to bottom, these were very similar to Kiddicraft blocks. So with such a simple idea that had kind of already been done, how did Lego win?\n\n\nSee also Why Oreo Won and a fascinating look at plastic injection molding, including a bit on “how quietly ingenious Lego’s injection molding process is”.\nTags: Lego   Phil Edwards   video",

Working through the wee hours of night and early morning, they perform maintenance work on tracks and electrical wires that ensures a smooth and uninterrupted ride during the day.\n\n\nMy pal Craig Mod recently spotted a “rare and majestic” inspection Shinkansen called Doctor Yellow.\nThe inspection vehicle is popular among train enthusiasts as a sighting of the train is said to bring good luck since it is so rarely glimpsed.\n\n\nGotta love a place that’s so deservedly proud of and enthusiastic about its rail infrastructure.\nTags: art   Craig Mod   illustration   Japan   Masami Onishi   trains",

Here’s a copy of the menu from that time:\n\nThe drive-in BBQ restaurant was a great success:\nThe restaurant had carhops serving guests and would often see 125 cars crowding the lot on weekends.  They quickly saw their annual sales topping $200,000 on a regular basis.\n\n\t\nBut competitors opened similar restaurants and they were selling more hamburgers than barbequed ham so the McDonald brothers closed their place for three months to retool. They reopened as plain old McDonald’s, serving cheap fare (like hamburgers) quickly. This is what an early version of the menu looked like:\n\nThe original McDonald’s served potato chips and pie, which were swapped out for french fries and milkshakes after the first year; that photo must have been taken sometime after the switch. Ray Kroc got involved in 1955 and opened the first McDonald’s franchise east of the Mississippi in Des Plaines, Illinois:\n\nThe version of the menu currently going around (on Reddit; I found it here) looks like it’s from the Kroc era, the arches having been introduced in 1953, shortly before he got involved:\n\nIt’s interesting to compare these early McDonald’s menus to the current menus of places like In-N-Out Burger and Five Guys, especially in comparison with the sprawling McDonald’s menu of today:\n\nAfter reading all these menus, you’re probably getting hungry. So here’s how to make a hamburger that tastes like an original McDonald’s hamburger from 1948 (as well as recipes for a bunch of other McDonald’s menu items, from McNuggets to the McRib to the dipping sauces).

From Mehdi Hasan’s piece in The Atlantic, adapted from his new book, Win Every Argument: The Art of Debating, Persuading, and Public Speaking (ebook):\nTrump may be the grand master of the Gish Gallop, but he is not its originator. That honor goes to the person who gave the method its name: Duane Tolbert Gish.\nGish was a biochemist at the Institute for Creation Research, a pseudo-scientific group that maintains all life on Earth was created in six days by the God of the Old Testament at some point in the past 10,000 years, with evolution playing no part. Gish publicized the ICR and its creed — and himself — by winning debates against evolutionists across the country.\n\n\nDuring debates, after letting his opponent go first, Gish would “begin talking very quickly for perhaps an hour”, overwhelming his opponent with factual-sounding nonsense. According to Hasan, there are a few tactics you can use to counter the Gish Gallop, but you’ve got to be prepared. For instance, you can call them out:\nDon’t let your audience be fooled into assuming that your opponent has special command of the subject because of all the “facts” they’ve just spouted. Explain to them what your opponent is doing, and that the Gallop is really just a sleight of hand.\n\n\n Tags: Donald Trump   Mehdi Hasan   politics",

It would be incredible if it lives up to them and the first two teaser trailers are a good start.\nAlso, I love how completely and utterly thirrrrrrsty the video’s description is to establish the bona fides and pedigree of the movie’s cast and crew:\nFrom Oscar-nominated writer/director Greta Gerwig (“Little Women,” “Lady Bird”) comes “Barbie,” starring Oscar-nominees Margot Robbie (“Bombshell,” “I, Tonya”) and Ryan Gosling (“La La Land,” “Half Nelson”) as Barbie and Ken, alongside America Ferrera (“End of Watch,” the “How to Train Your Dragon” films), Kate McKinnon (“Bombshell,” “Yesterday”), Michael Cera (“Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,” “Juno”), Ariana Greenblatt (“Avengers: Infinity War,” “65”), Issa Rae (“The Photograph,” “Insecure”), Rhea…",

The partners go from standing in disarray around the room to orderly sitting, two by two across from one another.  They go from tense standing disagreements to calm, relaxed collusion.\n\n\nThis video is also a reminder of what a great show Mad Men was (it’s in my all-time top 5) and how they just don’t make TV like this anymore.\nTags: film school   Mad Men   TV   video",

For the most part, our interactions weren’t nearly so high-minded. We stole each other’s kills and squabbled over loot. She badgered me for V-Bucks so she could buy her character new baubles in the Item Shop. But sometimes, after playing, we’d go for a walk and analyze how we were able to notch a dub — Fortnite-speak for a win — or how we might have done better. We’d assess the quality of newly introduced weapons. (The best were OP, for “overpowering,” but often the…",

I talked about how to separate work from life:\nIf I let it, every part of my life could be part of my job: not only books, movies, and travel but kids, relationships, emotions, everyday goings-on, etc. etc. etc. That’s the way it used to be, much more than it is now. But slicing and dicing everything up for consumption all the time, meta-experiencing absolutely everything; that’s no way to live. Back in the day, you saw journalers and bloggers burn out from sharing too much of themselves and their lives online with others — now you see it happening with YouTubers, TikTokers, and influencers.
