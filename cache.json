We visited this place during a very windy week, with winds blowing 30-35 kts the entire time. We got acquainted with a few northern rapids, like Hole in the Wall and Surge Narrows. It is a bit of a mindfuck to think that in these waters the tide ebbs north and floods south.\nThis summer has been especially arid, and because of it the province has seen a lot forest fires (see pictures of our smokey transit). Trails that we know and love on Cortes Island, that are usually wet and muddy, were bone dry this year. We had a few days of hard rain, during that time we collect rain water and go for walks to  look for slugs and snails.\nBoth of us have been drawing a lot this month, see this Neoneve portrait(Mastodon) by Devine (drawn with Oekaki), and this sketch thread(Mastodon) by Rek..\nPino book club\nWe have read Adam Wisniewski-Snerg's Robot, George Orwell's Homage to Catalonia, and Michael A.

          "description": "On the Console Repair Discord I'd offered to fix a Pokémon Sapphire cart that was initially not working, but then went to a repair shop and came back with a leg on one of the chips missing.\nThe work would require grinding down the silicone of the chip to expose the internals of the missing leg and jump it to the solder pad. The cart was also missing a resistor and capacitor.\nI decided to start by completely removing the chips from the board, and I'm glad I did because underneath I found a lot of corrosion and junk from either time or previous attempts. The solder joints also looked dull which suggested to me that it would benefit from a reflow.\nOnce this was done, the board was cleaned (thankfully there was no trace repair required), I replaced the chips and went about grinding the ROM chip to expose the broken leg.\n\nOnce exposed, I created a jumper using solder to the pad, installed a few missing components (a capacitor and resistor had been lost previously) and it was all back to life.",

          "description": "Cutting to the chase: text editors *and* tabs vs. spaces!  Ooooh!\n\n\nI've had this thing called \"e\" for a while now.  It's a stupid little \nscript which serves to do a couple of things.  It starts my \neditor\nwith a given file, and it kicks it with the right arguments to make it \ndisable line wrapping and to make the [TAB] key actually put in two \nspaces.\n\n\nSo, my dumb script would use \"-w -E -T 2\" most of the time, except when it \nwas running on a Makefile, at which point it would skip those args.  \nSimple enough, right?\n\n\npico is back?  Yes indeed, on Macs, as of 12.3, pico is in fact back.  To \nmake sure I wasn't imagining things, I tracked down a machine that hadn't \nbeen upgraded yet and checked there.  Sure enough, it was in fact nano and \nnot pico.\n\n\nmacOS 12.3 has nano as a symlink... pointing to pico!\n\n\nAt some point, I switched from literal tab characters in my source code to \nblobs of spaces, probably due to using that style at work and not hating \nit.  So, somewhere along the line I actually started depending on nano \nbehavior without realizing it.\n\n\nAs for the lack of a feature in pico itself, it's kind of strange, really.  \nIf you go digging into the source, they have this random.c with a function \ncalled tab which claims to \"simulate tab stop\" using spaces.  That said, I \ncan't find any place where it would be called with the magic values which \nwould make it behave that way.\n\n\nIt wouldn't surprise me if this switch is just more of Apple removing \nGPLed things from their OS - pico seems to use the Apache license.  They \ndumped bash for zsh (MIT license) at some point (Big Sur, I think), and \nnow this?  Okay then.",

          "description": "Here's a very old and stupid trick you could do with some filesystems in \nsome situations back in the day... and might still be able to do in a \nfew places today.\n\n\nThe problem is that while version X might eventually have an exploit, \nit'll get removed and it'll be replaced by version Y without that\nparticular hole.  By the time you get your hands on a tool to break into \nX, it'll be gone.\n\n\nWhat you'd do is create a hard link pointing at the file you wanted to \npreserve, storing it in a spot which was writable by your account.  \nThen, say, /usr/bin/sudo (because that never has security \nissues...) gets replaced at some point with a new file and you get to \nkeep the old version.  When you get the tool to pop it, off you go!\n\n\nOf course, these days, it's not quite so easy on the more modern systems \nyou find.  Debian 11 here won't let me do it - it's EPERM city.  Rocky 8 \n(so CentOS 8 and RHEL 8 too) also won't do it.  They both have some gunk\nin /usr/lib/sysctl.d to lock this down.  But, my old Slackware 14.2 \ninstall of my workstation let me do it the last time I tried about \na year ago.  How about that, huh?  I bet it'd still work if I dug out \nthe old drives and booted them up.\n\n\nIncidentally, this is the magic sauce: /proc/sys/fs/protected_hardlinks\nRead the man page for proc(5) to learn more about it.\n\nhere it is,\nthe thread I read a long time ago.  It's interesting to note that as far \nas I can tell, nothing actually changed upstream.  This left paranoid \nadmins like me with no option but to use the (most excellent) Openwall \npatches to lock down this kind of stuff.  I used that on my machines at \nwork which had non-staff users... just in case.\n\n\nThis whole situation is scary.  \nRead more about it.",

          "description": "One of the fun things I used to do at a prior job was to dig through the \nraw data points which were collected from the *many* servers we had.  I \ncould just pick an interesting-sounding metric and then would just ask \nthe system to show me the top 10 or bottom 10 out of a population of \nthousands or more.\n\n\nTo get my feet wet with the whole \"investigations\" thing that we'd do, I \nstarted looking into this one day and chose one of the many temp sensors \nwhich were being logged by the servers.  I forget exactly which one it \nwas, for there were many.  The CPUs logged it, the chassis logged it, \nthe power supply logged it, and so on.  There were so many choices.\n\n\nI went looking for a reason.  What could possibly explain this?  First \noff, it didn't line up with any obvious pattern in the host names.  The \nhosts were named for whichever team owned them, followed by a sequence \nnumber that was bumped any time a new one was provisioned.  There was no \nsignal to be found in that.\n\n\nThere was more, though.  You could also see a \"rack position\" in this \ndata, and now it started getting interesting.  It seems that all of the \nreally hot machines had a rack position of something low, like 04 or 05, \nand never anything higher than that.  In fact, when looking at a whole \nrack, it was always the lowest number of all of the positions that were \nbeing used.  Now this was worth chasing!\n\n\nIt's good that I asked, since they told me something surprising: \nposition 04 or 05 or whatever was the *bottom* of the rack.  Yes, \nsomehow, the lowest machine in the rack was the hottest!  They found \nthis interesting, too, and wound up digging into it.  Given that I was \nfar away in a distant office, this was the best way for us to proceed.\n\n\nThe problem was that the bottommost server would have nothing below it \nbut just open space until it got to the floor.  That space would not \nmove air efficiently, and it obviously mattered.\n\n\nThis rolled out and my hot spots disappeared.  Fantastic!",

In short, it looks like every Raspberry Pi filesystem installed \nfrom any given release image probably ends up with the same\nUUID.\n\n\nFor instance, if you downloaded the \"lite\" version of Raspbian between \nroughly November 8th and January 28th, you probably got a file called \n2021-10-30-raspios-bullseye-armhf-lite.zip.  Inside, there's an image, \nand the idea is that you dump that straight to your SD card, cram it in \nthe Pi, and off you go.  The second partition on that image is an ext4 \nfilesystem which was created on some build machine somewhere.  The UUID \non it never gets \"evolved\" to something else after the install.\n\n\nYou can see it inside the image itself here:\n\n\nOr, if you actually installed a few of these things like I did over the \npast couple of months, you can just 'tune2fs -l /dev/mmcblk0p2' and see \nthe same value in there.\n\n\nDon't end up with a pile of SD cards on your desk and think \"I know, \nI'll use the filesystem UUIDs to track which one goes where\", in other \nwords.\n\n\nIf it's not breaking anything for you, it's probably best to just let it \nbe.  Untangling a boot mess on these weird little boxes is anything but \nfun.\n\nNote: if you're actually on a recent Raspberry Pi, odds are good that \nyour /etc/fstab will be using *partition* UUIDs (PARTUUID=...) and not \nthose of the filesystem.  If in doubt, use blkid to see what's what.",

In this video, Kurzgesagt explores the possibilities and impossibilities. This part baked my noodle (in a good way):\nContrary to widespread belief, the singularity of a black hole is not really \"at its center\". It's in the future of whatever crosses the horizon. Black holes warp the universe so drastically that, at the event horizon, space and time switch their roles. Once you cross it, falling towards the center means going towards the future. That's why you cannot escape: Stopping your fall and turning back would be just as impossible as stopping time and traveling to the past. So the singularity is actually in your future, not \"in front of you\". And just like you can't see your own future, you won't see the singularity until you hit it.\n\n\n🤯\nTags: black holes · Kurzgesagt · physics · science · video",

He spoke to the NY Times about how his work puts him in the flow state:\n\"I loved that when I worked on a piece, I didn't think about my problems — my divorce, the pandemic,\" said Mr. Cortes. \"It was an escape — like I'm meditating, literally floating. I didn't have a problem in the world. I wanted that high again, I kept chasing that.\"\n\n\nLove that and love the miniatures...they are crazy realistic.\nBlighted façades and distressed structures are the very scenes which fuel Daniel's attention to detail. The work to produce each piece is arduous and requires great precision to achieve such realism. Daniel had developed techniques that can give a model an aged, distressed or patinated style. He also recreates miniature scaled vintage advertising posters and graffiti art on his models. Daniel's miniature models make unique collectable creations that will take you on a gritty romantic journey through New York that everyday passers by have overlooked.\n\n\nYou can check out more of Cortes' work on Instagram.\nTags: art · Danny Cortes · NYC",

It's time we worked together towards a world where all people have the power and resources to care for and support their bodies, identities, and health — for themselves and their families. We need to take the hassle, hustle, and harassment out of healthcare. It's time to change the conversation about abortion, to make it a real option, available to all people without shame or judgment. We all love someone who has had an abortion, whether we know it or not.\n\n\nThe video is three years old and from the very first line (\"Abortion is legal in all 50 states\"), you can tell how much the situation has changed in the United States — and how the NNAF's mission is even more urgent.

Boys and girls.\nIt's imagination that counts. Not skill. You build whatever comes into your head, the way you want it. A bed or a truck. A dolls house or a spaceship.\nA lot of boys like dolls houses. They're more human than spaceships. A lot of girls prefer spaceships. They're more exciting than dolls houses.\nThe most important thing is to the put the right material in the their hands and let them create whatever appeals to them.\n\n\t\nThe letter seems like the sort of thing that might be fake, but Robbie Gonzalez of io9 presents the case for its authenticity.\nIn our home, Lego currently rules the roost...the kids (a boy and a girl) spend more time building with Lego than doing anything else. This weekend, they worked together to build a beach scene, with a house, pool, lifeguard station, car, pond (for skimboarding), and surfers. Dollhouse stuff basically. Then they raced around the house with Lego spaceships and race cars.

I will never tire of looking at the detail of the Sun's surface.\n\n\n\nAngel An. \"This is not, as it might first appear, an enormous extraterrestrial, but the lower tendrils of a sprite (red lightning)! This rarely seen electrical discharge occurs much higher in the atmosphere than normal lightning (and indeed, despite the name, is created by a different mechanism), giving the image an intriguingly misleading sense of scale.\"\n\n\n\nMehmet Ergün. More Sun!\n\n\n\nMarcel Drechsler, Xavier Strottner and Yann Sainty for their shot of the Andromeda galaxy.\n\nThe last shot was the overall winner. While not as dramatic as some of the others, it documented the discovery of a previously unknown feature of a nearby cosmic neighbor:\nThe Andromeda galaxy is the closest spiral galaxy to our own Milky Way, and one of the most photographed deep-sky objects. Yet this particular photo, captured by an international trio of amateur astronomers, revealed a feature that had never been seen before: a huge plasma arc, stretching out across space right next to the Andromeda galaxy.\n\"Scientists are now investigating the newly discovered giant in a transnational collaboration,\" explain the photographers. \"It could be the largest such structure nearest to us in the Universe.\"\n\n\nYou can see the rest of the winning images on the Royal Observatory site as well as coverage from the BBC, the Guardian, Colossal, and Universe Today.\nTags: astronomy · best of · best of 2023 · photography · science · space",

Elizabeth played a crucial role in her husband's lavish publications, creating beautifully detailed and historically significant accurate illustrations of over six hundred birds -many of which were new to science. However, Elizabeth's role was not always fully credited and, following her tragic death aged only thirty-seven, her efforts and talent were nearly forgotten.\n\n\nBirds of the World: The Art of Elizabeth Gould is available for pre-order from Amazon or Bookshop.org and comes out on November 7.

It doesn't give us much in the way of plot or character updates, but here's the season synopsis (spoilers if you're not caught up to the end of season three):\nRocketing into the new millennium in the eight years since Season 3, Happy Valley has rapidly expanded its footprint on Mars by turning former foes into partners. Now 2003, the focus of the space program has turned to the capture and mining of extremely valuable, mineral-rich asteroids that could change the future of both Earth and Mars. But simmering tensions between the residents of the now-sprawling international base threaten to undo everything they are working towards.\n\n\nI have to admit my interest in the show waned a bit after the first season, but it's still a pretty great show and I will be tuning in for season four on November 10. And is it just me or, if you tilt your head and squint, can you see For All Mankind as a prequel/origin story for The Expanse? (via gizmodo)\nTags: For All Mankind · space · trailers · TV · video",

          "description": "I really enjoyed this piece by Tom Vanderbilt on how time is kept, coordinated, calculated, and forecast. It's full of interested tidbits throughout, like:\nCare to gawk at one of the world's last surviving original radium standards, a glass ampoule filled with 20.28 milligrams of radium chloride prepared by Marie Curie in 1913? NIST has it in the basement, encased in a steel bathtub, buried under lead bricks.\n\n\nAnd:\nFor GPS to work, it needs ultra-exact timing: accuracy within fifteen meters requires precision on the order of fifty nanoseconds. The 5G networks powering our mobile phones demand ever more precise levels of cell-tower synchronization or calls get dropped.\n\n\nAnd:\nAnd as Mumford could have predicted, nowhere has time become so fetishized as in the financial sector, with the emergence over the past decade of algorithmic high-frequency trading. Donald MacKenzie, the author of Trading at the Speed of Light, estimated in 2019 that a trading program could receive market data and trigger an order in eighty-four nanoseconds, or eighty-four billionths of a second.\n\n\nAnd:\nAll this makes F1 staggeringly accurate: it will gain or shed only one second every 100,000,000 years. Since the days when time was defined astronomically, the accuracy of the second is estimated to have increased by a magnitude of eight.\n\n\nAnd:\n\"A clock accurate to a second over the age of the cosmos,\" Patrick Gill, a physicist at the U.K.'s National Physical Laboratory, is quoted as saying in New Scientist, \"would allow tests of whether physical laws and constants have varied over the universe's history.\"\n\n\nAnd:\n\"If you were to lift this clock up a centimeter of elevation,\" Hume told me, \"you would be able to discern a difference in the ticking rate.\" The reason is Einstein's theory of relativity: Time differs depending on where you are experiencing it.\n\n\nAnd I could go on and on. If any or all of those tidbits is interesting to you, you should go ahead and read the whole thing.\nTags: physics · science · time · Tom Vanderbilt",

It's a simple application of Newtonian physics: the boats all just nose into the island, gun their motors, and slowly shove the island out of the way.\nThe floating clump of mud and plant material is technically a bog, not an island, but it's hefty enough to support the growth of trees all the same. Looking at it, you could easily believe it was a fully-fledged island. That is... until it starts drifting around.\n\"It's one of the first things you look for when you come out here in the morning; where's the bog?\" Denny Reyes, owner of The Landing in Chippewa, told Arizona News.\nThe problematic bog is actually one of many, but it's one of the biggest and close to a bridge that can get blocked when it goes for a wander. In 2022, with the wind on their side, it took around 25 boats to budge the bog and collectively push it back out into the lake.\n\n\n Tags: time lapse · video",

          "description": "Going to the movies used to be a somewhat different experience than it is today: people wandered into a theater at any point in a film and would just watch until it looped back around when they came in. From a piece in the Hollywood Reporter:\nThroughout the classical Hollywood era, moviegoers dropped in on a film screening whenever they felt like it, heedless of the progress of the narrative. In the usual formulation, a couple go to the movies, enter midway into the feature film, sit through to the end of the movie, watch the newsreel, cartoon, and comedy short at the top of the program, and then sit through the feature film until they recognize the scene they walked in on. At this point, one moviegoer whispers to their partner, \"This is where we came in,\" and they exit the theater.\n\n\nThis began to change in the 40s and 50s for a variety of reasons — theater owners and movie studios didn't like it, movies were getting more complex, the rise of TV, etc. — but the real shift occurred with the premiere of Psycho in 1960. The studio put out a promotional blitz before it's release stating that no one would be allowed entrance to the theater after the start of the film.\nOn June 16, 1960, after a saturation campaign giving fair warning, the DeMille and Baronet theaters in New York premiered Psycho with the see-it-from-the-beginning edict in place. In a practice later to be known as \"fill and spill,\" exhibitors hustled audiences in and out with military efficiency (the staggered showtimes — every two-hours for the 109-minute film — made for a tight squeeze). Uniformed Pinkerton guards were on hand to enforce the policy.\n\n\nHere's a video of Hitchcock laying out the policy for moviegoers (via open culture):\n\nPsycho didn't singlehandedly stop the practice, but Hitchcock's stand was an important part in shifting moviegoing practices to the set start times we have today.\nTags: Alfred Hitchcock · movies · Psycho · video",

Austin Kleon elaborated on scenius in his book Show Your Work:\nThere's a healthier way of thinking about creativity that the musician Brian Eno refers to as \"scenius.\" Under this model, great ideas are often birthed by a group of creative individuals — artists, curators, thinkers, theorists, and other tastemakers — who make up an \"ecology of talent.\" If you look back closely at history, many of the people who we think of as lone geniuses were actually part of \"a whole scene of people who were supporting each other, looking at each other's work, copying from each other, stealing ideas, and contributing ideas.\" Scenius doesn't take away from the achievements of those great individuals: it just acknowledges that good work isn't created in a vacuum, and that creativity is always, in some sense, a collaboration, the result of a mind connected to other minds.\n\n\n Tags: Ariel Schulman · Austin Kleon · Brian Eno · Casey Neistat · Greta Gerwig · Henry Joost · Lena Dunham · movies · Nev Schulman · NYC · Safdie brothers · Van Neistat · video",

So did Jon Keegan; he scraped the DMV websites of all 50 states and DC and came up with over 8,200 different plate combinations you might see out on the road.\nBy my count, there are currently 8,291 different vehicle license plates offered by the 50 states and the District of Columbia. States now offer a vast menu of personalized plate options for a dizzying array of organizations, professions, sports teams, causes and other groups. \nMy count was conducted over June and July 2023, so this should be considered a snapshot, as I'm sure some plates have changed already.\n\n\nFun fact: finishers of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race are eligible to get a special \"Iditarod Finisher\" plate for their car.\nLess fun fact, per Keegan:\nYes, license plates are still made by cheap prison labor in most states. 80% of all license plates issued in the U.S. today were made by state prisoners, with only 12 states opting out of the practice. According to a 2022 ACLU report on prison labor in the U.S., many states offer no pay at all to prisoners, while the average hourly wage across the country was between 13 and 52 cents per hour.\n\n\nHere in Vermont, the use of prison labor for manufacturing things like license plates resulted in the image of a pig hidden in a cow's spots appearing on an official crest emblazoned on state police cars back in 2012.\nTags: design · Jon Keegan · prison · USA",

The thousands of species of wild bee are paid less attention and are no less important to maintaining healthy ecosystems (and yes, helping out with pollination).\nAs a group, wild bees are considered incredibly important pollinators, especially for home gardens and crops that honey bees can't pollinate. Tomatoes, eggplants, and peppers, for example, require \"buzz pollination;\" bees have to vibrate their bodies to shake the pollen free — a behavior that honey bees can't do (bumblebees and some other native species can).\nYet these free services native bees provide are dwindling. While wild bees are, as a group, understudied, existing research suggests that many species are threatened with extinction, including more than a quarter of North American bumblebees.\n\n\n Tags: bees · video",

The film is based on Brock Yates' 1991 book Enzo Ferrari: The Man and the Machine.\nNext to the Pope, Ferrari was the most revered man in Italy. But was he the benign padrone portrayed by an adoring world press at the time, or was he a ruthless despot, who drove his staff to the edge of madness, and his racing drivers even further?\nBrock Yates's definitive biography penetrated Ferrari's elaborately constructed veneer and uncovered the truth behind Ferrari's bizarre relationships, his work with Mussolini's fascists, and his fanatical obsession with speed.\n\n\nFerrari just premiered at the Venice Film Festival and early reviews are mostly positive but not overwhelmingly so.

Over the next two decades, she sent pieces of silk to famous people from around the world and they signed them and sent them back to her. She assembled them into a quilt with a tumbling blocks pattern (aka, the Q*bert pattern).\nThe signatures that Harris was able to acquire are astounding: Harriet Beecher Stowe, Charles Dickens, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Samuel Morse, Alexandre Dumas, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Alexander von Humboldt, Washington Irving, and Nathaniel Hawthorne. Oh, and eight US Presidents: Martin Van Buren, John Tyler, Millard Fillmore, Franklin Pierce, James Buchanan, Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Johnson, and Ulysses S. Grant.\nThe aesthetics of this thing are just marvelous, with all the different colors and patterns arranged into a strict grid.\nOh and I couldn't resist checking The Great Span of the quilt. The earliest-born signatory I could find is Alexander von Humboldt, who was born in 1769, and the last person to die was Mary Virginia Hawes Terhune, who died in 1922. That's a span of 154 years, all in one incredible quilt.\nI found this via the Public Domain Review, who is offering prints of the quilt.\nTags: Adeline Harris · art",

          "description": "Oh yay, I had been wondering just the other day what Errol Morris has been up to and it turns out to be a project with Apple TV+ called The Pigeon Tunnel, which is billed as the final interview with espionage novelist John le Carré (born David Cornwell).\nIt's terribly difficult to recruit for a secret service. You're looking for somebody who's a bit bad, but at the same time, loyal. There's a type. And I fit it perfectly.\n\n\nThe movie has the same title and covers some of the same ground as le Carré's 2016 memoir, probably with more of an emphasis on Morris's general obsession with what constitutes truth. More info on the film from the Toronto International Film Festival, where the movie is premiering on Sept 11:\nCornwell once worked for the British spy agencies MI5 and MI6. He sparingly gave interviews, but accepted Morris' invitation because he saw it \"as something definitive.\" He had already begun a process of opening up in his memoir The Pigeon Tunnel: Stories from My Life.\nCrucial to the narrative is the author's relationship to his father Ronnie, an inveterate gambler and con artist. Cornwell's mother disappeared when he was five, so his main frame of reference was the world of his father, who was endlessly on the run from the mob or the police. The title The Pigeon Tunnel comes from Cornwell's experience as a child going to Monte Carlo with Ronnie. Imprinted on his memory was a shooting range on the top of a cliff. Beneath the grass was a tunnel from which trapped pigeons were ejected over the sea as targets.\n\n\nThe Pigeon Tunnel will be out on Apple TV+ on Oct 20, 2023.\nTags: books · Errol Morris · espionage · John le Carre · movies · The Pigeon Tunnel · trailers · video",

          "description": "Market researcher Clotaire Rapaille was interviewed for an episode of Frontline on advertising and marketing back in 2003. I like what he had to say about the differences in how the French and Americans think about cheese.\nFor example, if I know that in America the cheese is dead, which means is pasteurized, which means legally dead and scientifically dead, and we don't want any cheese that is alive, then I have to put that up front. I have to say this cheese is safe, is pasteurized, is wrapped up in plastic. I know that plastic is a body bag. You can put it in the fridge. I know the fridge is the morgue; that's where you put the dead bodies. And so once you know that, this is the way you market cheese in America.\nI started working with a French company in America, and they were trying to sell French cheese to the Americans. And they didn't understand, because in France the cheese is alive, which means that you can buy it young, mature or old, and that's why you have to read the age of the cheese when you go to buy the cheese. So you smell, you touch, you poke. If you need cheese for today, you want to buy a mature cheese. If you want cheese for next week, you buy a young cheese. And when you buy young cheese for next week, you go home, [but] you never put the cheese in the refrigerator, because you don't put your cat in the refrigerator. It's the same; it's alive. We are very afraid of getting sick with cheese. By the way, more French people die eating cheese than Americans die. But the priority is different; the logic of emotion is different. The French like the taste before safety. Americans want safety before the taste.\n\n\t\n(via @pieratt)\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n[This was originally posted on July 29, 2013.]\nTags:cheese    \nClotaire Rapaille    \nfood",

          "description": "In a lecture given in 1924, German mathematician David Hilbert introduced the idea of the paradox of the Grand Hotel, which might help you wrap your head around the concept of infinity. (Spoiler alert: it probably won't help...that's the paradox.) In his book One Two Three... Infinity, George Gamow describes Hilbert's paradox:\nLet us imagine a hotel with a finite number of rooms, and assume that all the rooms are occupied. A new guest arrives and asks for a room. \"Sorry,\" says the proprietor, \"but all the rooms are occupied.\" Now let us imagine a hotel with an infinite number of rooms, and all the rooms are occupied. To this hotel, too, comes a new guest and asks for a room.\n\"But of course!\" exclaims the proprietor, and he moves the person previously occupying room N1 into room N2, the person from room N2 into room N3, the person from room N3 into room N4, and so on.... And the new customer receives room N1, which became free as the result of these transpositions.\nLet us imagine now a hotel with an infinite number of rooms, all taken up, and an infinite number of new guests who come in and ask for rooms.\n\"Certainly, gentlemen,\" says the proprietor, \"just wait a minute.\"\nHe moves the occupant of N1 into N2, the occupant of N2 into N4, and occupant of N3 into N6, and so on, and so on...\nNow all odd-numbered rooms became free and the infinite of new guests can easily be accommodated in them.\n\n\t\nThis TED video created by Jeff Dekofsky explains that there are similar strategies for finding space in such a hotel for infinite numbers of infinite groups of people and even infinite amounts of infinite numbers of infinite groups of people (and so on, and so on...) and is very much worth watching:\n\n(via brain pickings)\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n[This was originally posted on February 19, 2015.]\nTags:David Hilbert    \nGeorge Gamow    \ninfinity    \nJeff Dekofsky    \nmathematics    \nvideo",

With that, writes Bill McKibben, has come a sense of unease about the future, particularly about the places we live and will be able to live.\nDrawing on his experience as a Vermonter, McKibben argues that no place is truly safe from the effects of the climate crisis, but we can find protection from it by rebuilding our sense of community and social trust. Those things can provide the resilience we're going to need to get though this.\nWe've come through 75 years where having neighbors was essentially optional: if you had a credit card, you could get everything you needed to survive dropped off at your front door. But the next 75 years aren't going to be like that; we're going to need to return to the basic human experience of relying on the people around you. We're going to need to rediscover that we're a social species, which for Americans will be hard — at least since Reagan we've been told to think of ourselves first and foremost (it was his pal Margaret Thatcher who insisted 'there is no such thing as society, only individual men and women.\") And in the Musk/Trump age we're constantly instructed to distrust everyone and everything, a corrosion that erodes the social fabric as surely as a rampaging river erodes a highway.\n\n\n Tags: Bill McKibben · climate crisis · politics · Vermont",

Not who has what chances of winning, but the consequences for our democracy. Not the odds, but the stakes.\n\n\nRosen first articulated this principle more than a decade ago and ever since reading about it a few years ago, I've all but stopped reading and linking to political horse race coverage. Who scored more \"points\" in the latest debate? Which candidate seems the most Presidential? Will his mugshot bolster his campaign? Come on, this isn't the goddamned Oscars red carpet. Tell us what the candidates' plans are and how they will affect how Americans live their lives. What experience do they have in governance? Or if not governance, in leadership? What do they believe, what actions have they taken in the past and what consequences have those actions had on actual people? What motivates them...power, money, fame, service? Many many people will not give a shit about any of this, but if we want to retain a functioning democracy with a press that's not primarily about entertainment, voters need to know what they are getting into.\n\nAnd I would argue, how they should cover many other important issues. So much of \"tech\" news reads like horse race coverage instead of focusing what kind of world would result if Company A or Technology B were to succeed. Journalists and outlets that cover the stakes get my attention.↩\n\nTags: Jay Rosen · journalism · politics · USA",

The Republicans, Trump, the Supreme Court, billionaires, corporations, and corporate shareholders are using America's legal system to substantially weaken our democracy.

This doesn't seem good:\nThere is little precedent for a civilian's becoming the arbiter of a war between nations in such a granular way, or for the degree of dependency that the U.S. now has on Musk in a variety of fields, from the future of energy and transportation to the exploration of space. SpaceX is currently the sole means by which nasa transports crew from U.S. soil into space, a situation that will persist for at least another year.

          "description": "Right now, the Portland, OR area is suffering through a heat wave, with high temperatures some 20-25°F above normal. Earlier this year, meteorologist Guy Walton began naming North American heatwaves after oil companies:\nObviously, I'm naming heatwaves to highlight this worsening climate problem and perhaps save lives by getting the public to focus on this weather threat. This year I'm naming major heatwaves after oil companies to shame them in the process and to identify culprits that are exacerbating these deadly systems.\n\n\nPortland's hot spell, the fourth heatwave of the summer, is named Heatwave Citgo...having been preceded by Heatwave Amoco, Heatwave BP, and Heatwave Chevron. Next up on the list:\n5. Conoco (Phillips)\nAnd several more as needed. Here's Walton's criteria for choosing what constitutes a nameable heatwave (mirroring the scale for hurricanes):\nCAT 3: A major level heatwave severe enough such that a few fatalities are reported. A city in a CAT 3 heat wave would be under a heat emergency for a few days. Many heat records would be either tied or broken.\nA CAT3 or higher heatwave would be considered to be a major heatwave and would get a fossil fuel corporation name.\n\n\nThe highest category of heatwave is CAT5:\nCAT 5. Catastrophic heat wave. Many all-time temperature records would be shattered with thousands of deaths reported. Remember the European heat wave of 2003 in which there were well in excess of 10,000 fatalities? This event would certainly fit my CAT 5 category.\n\n\nThe media should actually start using these more widely. (via @dens)\nTags: climate crisis · Guy Walton · language · USA",

          "description": "The other day when I posted about iconic hip-hop samples from the past 50 years, I noticed a name that featured prominently in the early years: Sylvia Robinson. Robinson was the CEO and co-founder of the very first rap record label, Sugar Hill Records. She produced the first rap record, Rapper's Delight, and the seminal The Message, widely regarded as one of the best and most influential rap and hip-hop tracks ever.\nFrom an essay written on the occasion of her induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2022:\nSylvia Robinson played many roles in the music world — artist, producer, and, most notably, record executive. But as the founder and leader of the pioneering Sugar Hill label, she revealed herself to be something even rarer. She was a visionary.\nIn 1979, \"Rapper's Delight\" by the Sugarhill Gang introduced hip-hop to the global mainstream, illustrating the genre's commercial and creative potential. Robinson had overseen the record's backing track, assembled the group members, and arranged their vocals — but fundamentally, it was her idea that rap was even viable as recorded music. Her place in history would be secured by that track alone, though it was far from her only impact on the direction of pop.\n\n\nHere's a short video that covers the high points of her career:\n\nIt's sad that Robinson and her achievements haven't been more widely known — this seems like another case (as in computing and other industries) where women played an early vital role and were then forgotten.\nTags: hip-hop · music · Sylvia Robinson · video",

          "description": "The Illustrated Book of Poultry by Lewis Wright, first published in 1870 and revised several times in the decades following, was \"regarded as the most desirable of the English poultry books\". Poultry was very popular in Victorian England and the book housed a tremendous amount of practical poultry knowledge. From a Harvard Library blog post:\n\"Hen Fever\", as it became known during the Victorian Age, was an unprecedented obsession with owning, breeding, and showing the finest chickens in the world. The genesis of the poultry fancier owes much to Queen Victoria and her royal menagerie. In 1842, she acquired exotic chickens from China, and whatever the Queen did, the public would soon try to imitate and incorporate at home. The Illustrated London News reported \"Her Majesty's collection of fowls is very considerable, occupying half-a-dozen very extensive yards, several small fields, and numerous feeding-houses, laying-sheds, hospitals, winter courts, &c.\". From this point forward, poultry was no longer viewed as common farmyard critters, but valued and appreciated throughout the classes of Victorian Britain. The import and breeding of poultry was not just a leisurely hobby, but a profitable endeavor with sky rocketing price tags for the finest examples.\n\n\t\nBut the books also contained many wonderful illustrations of the finest examples of chickens and other poultry in the style of Audubon. The different breeds have amazing names like Buff Orpingtons, Plymouth Rocks, Dark Dorkingtons, and Gold Pencilled Hamburghs.\nI pulled the images above from a 1911 edition of the book. (via @john_overholt)\nUpdate: I removed a link to a reproduction of the book on Amazon because a reader reported that the quality was not great.

Molchanov pulled himself down and up using a guide rope without fins.\nA CWT dive that took 4m 13s and went to a depth of 133 meters (442 feet). CWT is when the diver uses a monofin and weight belt to dive and return to the surface.\n\nHis complete record-breaking dives are embedded above and are completely suspenseful to watch even though you know the outcome. They're almost like watching someone meditate instead of compete in an extreme sport. Molchanov needs to expend some energy and oxygen getting down and back, but also can't over-exert himself. A lot of it is just being relaxed and calm — this is truly a mind-over-matter discipline.\nI've written about Molchanov before,1 riffing off of this profile of him in GQ.\nWhen Alexey was younger, his mother, Natalia Molchanova, was the world's best freediver, a distinction that she held for many years. She was a pioneer in the sport and the practitioner of a mind-and-body-control technique called \"attention deconcentration.\" She passed her secrets to her son, who perfected them and uses the regimen to reach a state of intense calm. By doing so, he can slow his heart rate, his metabolic rate, while simultaneously slowing the activity of his brain and his body. His focus deepens. He relaxes to the point of seeming asleep. He takes deep, drowsy breaths, like a summer breeze filling a sail.\n\n\nI will never not be fascinated by freediving.\n\nAnd his mother Natalia, who was probably the best freediver ever and taught Alexey how. Natalia disappeared while diving in 2015 and is presumed dead.↩\n\nTags: Alexey Molchanov · free diving · sports · video",

For a year and a half, the company tried to work out the problem to no avail. One day, workers were reminiscing about an ex-employee, Irving, who didn't come to work at the new factory due to the long commute required. Irving's job was to move the sausages from the filling room to the smokehouse, taking them on a half hour journey through a maze of rooms where other products were getting produced. After noting this absence, it clicked that Irving's daily trip was the secret ingredient — on his journey the sausages were getting pre-cooked and infused with flavor. The company was eventually able to recreate the sausages' original taste, building a brand new room onto the factory which emulated the properties of Irving's trip.\n\n\n(via robin sloan)\nTags: Anna Pendergrast · business · Kelly Pendergrast",

Let the man loom, weave him between it all as he makes his way through Europe, sets up at Berkeley, is selected to lead Los Alamos. Ramp up the Nazi threat. Show the diaspora of brilliance more clearly. Believe the audience is willing to sit through more than just \"Is it a wave ... or is it particle?\" Oh! There is so much excitement, so much incredible science to be mined, and Nolan mined so little.\n\n\nMod and I both share a love for that masterpiece of a book and I would watch the hell out of an 10-part HBO series (in the vein of Chernobyl) based on it, American Prometheus, and John Hersey's Hiroshima.\nTags: atomic bomb · books · Craig Mod · movies · Oppenheimer · physics · science · The Making of the Atomic Bomb · World War II",

          "description": "Produced by Venus & Serena Williams and US soccer star Alex Morgan and directed by Rachel Ramsay & James Erskine, Copa 71 is a forthcoming documentary about a women's soccer tournament that took place in Mexico City in 1971 that was the first, albeit unofficial, Women's World Cup. A short teaser trailer is above. From a piece in Variety about the film:\nIn August 1971, more than 100,000 football fans packed Mexico City's Azteca Stadium for a historic tournament. Teams from England, France, Denmark, Argentina and Italy flew in for 21 days of matches alongside Mexico's national team, while eager sponsors lined up for a piece of the action. The players, who received a hero's welcome wherever they went, might as well have been the Rolling Stones.\nThey were, in fact, a group of around 100 women — many of them teenagers — taking part in a pioneering unofficial Women's World Cup. And just as quickly as they tasted fame, it was snatched away as the tournament was all but erased from football history.\n\n\nMany of the competitors were just teenagers — from Wikipedia:\nEngland's team included 13-year-old Leah Caleb, 14-year-old Gill Sayell, and 15-year-old Chris Lockwood; their captain was 19-year-old Carol Wilson and they were accompanied by referee Pat Dunn as a chaperone and trainer. 15-year-old Susanne Augustesen scored a hat-trick for Denmark as they beat Mexico 3-0 in the final.\n\n\nCopa 71 is premiering at the Toronto Film Festival in September and then hopefully will find its way into theaters and onto streaming.

And how can we find it in our daily lives? Explore steps you can take to increase your chances of finding flow.\n\n\nWhile I am not feeling particularly in the groove today, over the past several weeks I've been in the flow state a lot, working on a couple of projects for the site. It's been a long time since I've had that feeling for more than a couple of hours every few months and booooooy does it feel good.

The whole thread is worth a read...here are a couple of Zipper's points:\nTall vehicles have bigger blind spots and are more likely to strike a person's torso or head. Heavier vehicles exert more force crashing into a person, bicycle, or smaller car. They also have longer braking distances.\n\n\n\nHeavier cars exert more pressure on tires, eroding them faster. Tire particles are absorbed into water, where they damage ecosystems. They also float through the air, harming human health when ingested.\n\n\nFor further reading, Zipper links to a number of pieces he's written in recent months: The Blatant Greenwashing of SUVs, EVs Are Sending Toxic Tire Particles Into the Water, Soil, and Air, Carry That Weight, and The Car Safety Feature That Kills the Other Guy. Zipper's solution to these problems is government action: for example, taxing vehicles by weight, testing vehicles for pedestrian and cyclist safety, or requiring drivers have commercial driver's licenses for larger vehicles.\nThe image above is from Carsized and compares a 2018 Dodge Ram to a 2005 VW Jetta.\nTags: cars · David Zipper · USA",

DeSantis and Greg Abbott, the Texas governor, have also banned it from schools.\nHere again, though, there's no evidence of a public threat. CRT simply teaches America's history of racism, which students need to understand to be informed citizens.\nBanning it is a scare tactic to appeal to a largely white, culturally conservative voter base.\n\n\nHowever, I would argue that Reich needed to go a bit further. While the crises are inventions, their consequences go beyond mere distraction and into the territory of active harm, particularly of queer and trans people, Black people, and people of color.

People should be able to get to them by means other than a car, and conveniently. Such integrated commercial spaces are far more resilient. If your commercial spaces aren't resilient — if you just plop a big box outside the town — don't be surprised when it goes bust in a few years. And then it's bulldozed for the next thing to be put up for it to go bust the same way and then get bulldozed and then the next thing and the next and the next so on and so forth.\n\n\n Tags: Adam Kovacs · cities · economics · Europe · USA · video",

However, their relationship had gone pear-shaped and they were in the process of breaking up when we recorded 'Nothing Compares 2 U', so that's probably why she did such a good vocal. She came into the studio, did it in one take, double-tracked it straight away and it was perfect because she was totally into the song.

          "description": "Cruise ships are a relatively new human invention that look quite different from other ships. Oh, and they are absolutely massive. How did they get that way?\nThe predecessor of today's cruise ships was the ocean liner: big, beautiful ships that sailed across the Atlantic. But ocean liners had a totally different purpose from cruise ships: They were for transportation. Everything about them was designed to facilitate an ocean voyage from one continent to another.\nBut air travel changed that. Planes eliminated the main reason to take a ship somewhere, and ocean liner business plummeted. So the industry pivoted and began selling a ship as the destination itself. The cruise ship was born. But the ocean liners, built for a voyage, weren't ideal for the purposes of a cruise, and over the next few decades, the cruise ship began its evolution. And it has culminated in the behemoths we see today.\n\n\nCruise ships always make me think of David Foster Wallace's classic piece, Shipping Out (which you might know as A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again).\nTags: travel · video",

          "description": "Rebecca Solnit, writing for The Guardian on the climate crisis:\nMany things that were once true — that we didn't have adequate solutions, that the general public wasn't aware or engaged — no longer are. Outdated information is misinformation, and the climate situation has changed a lot in recent years. The physical condition of the planet — as this summer's unprecedented extreme heat and flooding and Canada's and Greece's colossal fires demonstrate — has continued to get worse; the solutions have continued to get better; the public is far more engaged; the climate movement has grown, though of course it needs to grow far more; and there have been some significant victories as well as the incremental change of a shifting energy landscape.\n\n\nI don't think of myself as a climate doomer, but I certainly feel less hopeful about the situation than Solnit does. She asserts that the main obstacles to meaningful action on the climate crisis in the West are politics and capitalism, which is supposed to make readers feel hopeful. But that's the part that often fills me with despair. The unpopular extremist party that controls more than half of the political apparatus in the country with the biggest responsibility to fix the planet is not only not interested in doing so, they are actively working against it. And they've built up such a wall against public accountability that I don't know if protest (which they will make illegal if they can) or even voting (which they've fought to make more difficult) are meaningful levers with which to try and change the situation.\nOk, maybe I am a climate doomer. But this piece by Solnit is good medicine for folks in despair about the climate. And I'm putting Not Too Late: Changing the Climate Story from Despair to Possibility (edited by Solnit and climate activist Thelma Young Lutunatabua) on my reading list as well.

          "description": "This is pretty cool: in collaboration with the British Museum, a team led by woodblock printmaker David Bull (who I first wrote about back in 20051) is carving woodblocks and creating prints from a series of previously unpublished drawings by legendary Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai.\nThe Museum has in their possession a group of drawings by Hokusai that were apparently intended for use in the production of a series of books. For reasons unknown to us now that project was cancelled, but the drawings survived, and we have selected 12 of them for a new subscription series.\nFor more details of the collection of images, please refer to this page of the British Museum website. But here, we can simply note that the drawings fall into a number of categories, and our set will reflect that diversity. Hokusai's series was intended to take his readers through aspects of Japanese historical culture, and we will meet Buddhist deities, warriors from ancient China, and historical landscapes, along with more prosaic scenes of the natural world.\n\n\nThe print shown above was the first one to be sent out in January. But look at this original drawing from the collection:\n\nWow. That is shockingly modern — like a 60s superhero comic or a still from 60s anime. I hope they reprint this one!\nHere's a video from the British Museum of Bull talking about the project:\n\nIf you make woodblock prints for a living, you know the name Hokusai, and if you're a woodblock carver and you hear about original drawings from Hokusai that have never been carved into prints you would most likely do a little happy dance.\n\n\n(via open culture)\n\nHooo boy, there are parts of that post that did not age well. Bull, however, is still doing his thing.↩\n\nTags: art · David Bull · Katsushika Hokusai · remix · video",

          "description": "In 1910, a group of inexperienced climbers claimed to have summited Denali, the highest peak in what is now the United States. Their story was greeted with skepticism.\nSo when I found out that the first people to reach the highest point in North America (Denali, the mountain formerly known as McKinley) were just a bunch of Average Joes with no climbing experience who went up on a bet, I was flabbergasted. How had I never heard this story? The more I looked into it, the more fantastic the story became. When these guys descended from the mountain, nobody believed they really even made it. And they wouldn't be the first people to fraudulently claim to have reached the top, with no evidence to offer that they succeeded. This story has all the makings of a blockbuster action comedy. It's almost unbelievable.\n\n\nBut later evidence suggests that they just might have made it to the top.\nTags: climbing · David Friedman · Denali · sports · video",

On the other hand, streaming has also changed how television gets produced, the role writers play, and how they get paid. We interviewed four television writers and showrunners about how streaming has changed how they work, how their incomes have taken a hit, and why it has become harder than ever to build a career.\n\n\n Tags: business · movies · TV · video",

When you apply 30V instead of the usual 2.5V or 5V, they move really fast:\n\nThis reminds me of when I was in grade school. Does anyone remember Stompers? They were battery-operated cars and trucks that were bigger than HotWheels and, while not remote-controlled, were able to move around under their own power. But they weren't that speedy...maybe they could do 1-2 mph.\nAnyway, some kid at school figured out that you could remove the AA battery, connect wires to the battery terminals, and then connect those wires to as many C- and D-cell batteries as you could gang together in a series. So instead of the usual 1.5V, you could pump 4.5V, 6V, 7.5V, or even 9V into those tiny cars. And boy, did they go. We could barely keep up as we raced them against each other down the halls, running behind them holding our battery packs. But the thrills were short-lived — I think the school banned them and all that current burned the tiny Stomper motors out after awhile. Fun while it lasted though!

          "description": "For the past 13 years, former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich has taught a class called Wealth & Poverty at UC Berkeley. He retired from teaching this year and has uploaded his lectures from the course to YouTube. \nWelcome to my final UC Berkeley course on Wealth and Poverty. Drawing on my 40+ years in politics, including my time as secretary of labor, I offer a deeper look at why inequalities of income and wealth have widened significantly since the late 1970s in the United States, and why this poses dangerous risks to our society.\nThis course also offers insights into the political and public-policy debates that have arisen in light of this inequality, as well as possible means of reversing it.\n\n\nHere's the first lecture, What's Happened to Income & Wealth:\n\nReich has also published an abbreviated syllabus for each of the classes; links can be found in his course introduction (here's class #1).\nTags: economics · education · politics · Robert Reich · USA · video",
