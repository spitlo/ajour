If you're wondering my SCUMM uses - in variable names, it's because it started out as a variant of LISP.\nP.P.S.

Then managed to pick up a faulty \"Color\" model for £40 on eBay listed as not working.\nOn inspection it looked, internally, very clean - no corrosion or damage. From my experience with Pokémon Mini handhelds, I was wondering if perhaps the power button wasn't getting the signal.\nSo I applied a slice of kitchen tin foil, some sticky tape and voilà, it powers up! I had to also apply it to the sound and start button (and I'll probably make this permanent with conductive paint one day), but otherwise it's all good.\n(And I snagged a flash cart so I was able to experience some translated romhacks too)",

The problem was that there was a repair attempt that had taken off the entire pad for the battery, and in fact had go through the pad, through the silk screen and had gone all the way into the fibre glass insulation layer (you might be able to see in the photo the woven pattern).\nBefore slapping a battery on and jumping the positive leg to the right component, I wanted to check that nothing else was missing. Thankfully the community have tried to preserve a lot of the history (in this case, the PCB traces) but also published it freely on the web.\nFrom this I also found a resistor had been lost in the previous repair. I don't think it's clear from my photo, but what I did was to bond the missing resistor in a completely different location (before it traces to a capacitor) and then use a jumper wire from the replaceable battery case. This was mostly in case the battery case was torn off again it wouldn't cause damage to the components on the board.\nOnce that was all done, the game happily had its clock and was returned to it's owner the same day.",

          "description": "Cutting to the chase: text editors *and* tabs vs. spaces!  Ooooh!\n\n\nI've had this thing called \"e\" for a while now.  It's a stupid little \nscript which serves to do a couple of things.  It starts my \neditor\nwith a given file, and it kicks it with the right arguments to make it \ndisable line wrapping and to make the [TAB] key actually put in two \nspaces.\n\n\nSo, my dumb script would use \"-w -E -T 2\" most of the time, except when it \nwas running on a Makefile, at which point it would skip those args.  \nSimple enough, right?\n\n\npico is back?  Yes indeed, on Macs, as of 12.3, pico is in fact back.  To \nmake sure I wasn't imagining things, I tracked down a machine that hadn't \nbeen upgraded yet and checked there.  Sure enough, it was in fact nano and \nnot pico.\n\n\nmacOS 12.3 has nano as a symlink... pointing to pico!\n\n\nAt some point, I switched from literal tab characters in my source code to \nblobs of spaces, probably due to using that style at work and not hating \nit.  So, somewhere along the line I actually started depending on nano \nbehavior without realizing it.\n\n\nAs for the lack of a feature in pico itself, it's kind of strange, really.  \nIf you go digging into the source, they have this random.c with a function \ncalled tab which claims to \"simulate tab stop\" using spaces.  That said, I \ncan't find any place where it would be called with the magic values which \nwould make it behave that way.\n\n\nIt wouldn't surprise me if this switch is just more of Apple removing \nGPLed things from their OS - pico seems to use the Apache license.  They \ndumped bash for zsh (MIT license) at some point (Big Sur, I think), and \nnow this?  Okay then.",

          "description": "Here's a very old and stupid trick you could do with some filesystems in \nsome situations back in the day... and might still be able to do in a \nfew places today.\n\n\nThe problem is that while version X might eventually have an exploit, \nit'll get removed and it'll be replaced by version Y without that\nparticular hole.  By the time you get your hands on a tool to break into \nX, it'll be gone.\n\n\nWhat you'd do is create a hard link pointing at the file you wanted to \npreserve, storing it in a spot which was writable by your account.  \nThen, say, /usr/bin/sudo (because that never has security \nissues...) gets replaced at some point with a new file and you get to \nkeep the old version.  When you get the tool to pop it, off you go!\n\n\nOf course, these days, it's not quite so easy on the more modern systems \nyou find.  Debian 11 here won't let me do it - it's EPERM city.  Rocky 8 \n(so CentOS 8 and RHEL 8 too) also won't do it.  They both have some gunk\nin /usr/lib/sysctl.d to lock this down.  But, my old Slackware 14.2 \ninstall of my workstation let me do it the last time I tried about \na year ago.  How about that, huh?  I bet it'd still work if I dug out \nthe old drives and booted them up.\n\n\nIncidentally, this is the magic sauce: /proc/sys/fs/protected_hardlinks\nRead the man page for proc(5) to learn more about it.\n\nhere it is,\nthe thread I read a long time ago.  It's interesting to note that as far \nas I can tell, nothing actually changed upstream.  This left paranoid \nadmins like me with no option but to use the (most excellent) Openwall \npatches to lock down this kind of stuff.  I used that on my machines at \nwork which had non-staff users... just in case.\n\n\nThis whole situation is scary.  \nRead more about it.",

          "description": "One of the fun things I used to do at a prior job was to dig through the \nraw data points which were collected from the *many* servers we had.  I \ncould just pick an interesting-sounding metric and then would just ask \nthe system to show me the top 10 or bottom 10 out of a population of \nthousands or more.\n\n\nTo get my feet wet with the whole \"investigations\" thing that we'd do, I \nstarted looking into this one day and chose one of the many temp sensors \nwhich were being logged by the servers.  I forget exactly which one it \nwas, for there were many.  The CPUs logged it, the chassis logged it, \nthe power supply logged it, and so on.  There were so many choices.\n\n\nI went looking for a reason.  What could possibly explain this?  First \noff, it didn't line up with any obvious pattern in the host names.  The \nhosts were named for whichever team owned them, followed by a sequence \nnumber that was bumped any time a new one was provisioned.  There was no \nsignal to be found in that.\n\n\nThere was more, though.  You could also see a \"rack position\" in this \ndata, and now it started getting interesting.  It seems that all of the \nreally hot machines had a rack position of something low, like 04 or 05, \nand never anything higher than that.  In fact, when looking at a whole \nrack, it was always the lowest number of all of the positions that were \nbeing used.  Now this was worth chasing!\n\n\nIt's good that I asked, since they told me something surprising: \nposition 04 or 05 or whatever was the *bottom* of the rack.  Yes, \nsomehow, the lowest machine in the rack was the hottest!  They found \nthis interesting, too, and wound up digging into it.  Given that I was \nfar away in a distant office, this was the best way for us to proceed.\n\n\nThe problem was that the bottommost server would have nothing below it \nbut just open space until it got to the floor.  That space would not \nmove air efficiently, and it obviously mattered.\n\n\nThis rolled out and my hot spots disappeared.  Fantastic!",

The UUID \non it never gets \"evolved\" to something else after the install.\n\n\nYou can see it inside the image itself here:\n\n\nOr, if you actually installed a few of these things like I did over the \npast couple of months, you can just 'tune2fs -l /dev/mmcblk0p2' and see \nthe same value in there.\n\n\nDon't end up with a pile of SD cards on your desk and think \"I know, \nI'll use the filesystem UUIDs to track which one goes where\", in other \nwords.\n\n\nIf it's not breaking anything for you, it's probably best to just let it \nbe.

This is something I relate to 1000%:\nI'm good at making things, but not talking about why. I made them because I don't know how to talk about why. The explanation is the thing I made.\n\n\nThis too is something I try to hold myself to:\nI also just do it, you know what I mean? I just make shit. 90% of doing anything is doing it. Not to sound self-help-y, but when people are asking me for advice, my first thought is, you should just do it. You beat so many people already if you just actually make a finished thing.\n\n\nI am still a perfectionist sort of person, but when your work entails publishing 10-20 things in public every single day, you have to let go of that. Good enough is better than nothing at all.\nEmbrace your inner little baby (with really good taste):\nI essentially have to get back to feeling like I'm a little baby to make things that are good.

          "description": "In the 60s and 70s, Howard Johnson's was the largest restaurant chain in the US — the restaurants and their associated hotels were ubiquitous while travelling America's roadways. So it made sense that when Stanley Kubrick needed a hospitality brand for the Earthlight Room on the space station circling Earth in 2001: A Space Odyssey, he reached for HoJo's.\nAnd of course, even in 1968, you had to do some sort of cross-promotion and, bizarrely, what Howard Johnson's came up with was a 2001-themed children's menu.\n\nEven more weirdly, the menu is not about the movie itself, it's about a family that goes to see the movie. The whole opening sequence with the apes is omitted entirely, as is the HAL 9000 (arguably the film's main character) — I suspect the HoJo's people didn't get to see the entire movie while putting this together (as evidenced by the \"preview edition\" graphic in the bottom right corner of the menu's cover). \n\nIt's cool to see scenes from the movie rendered in comics form:\n\n\nYou can see the entire menu here, including the activity page — just click on one of the images to enter slideshow mode.

          "description": "Using data from the ESA's Mars Express probe, the German Aerospace Center has released an enhanced color image of Mars that shows off the planet's geology and mineral content better than the usual dusty red photos do. Here's part of what you're seeing:\nIt is well known that most of Mars is reddish in colour, due to the high amount of oxidised iron in the dust on its surface, earning it the nickname the 'Red Planet'. But it is also immediately noticeable that a considerable region of Mars is rather dark, appearing bluish in colour in image 1. These regions represent greyish-blackish-bluish sands, which are volcanic in origin and form large, dark sand layers on Mars. They were primarily piled up by the wind to form imposing sand dunes or enormous dune fields on the floor of impact craters. These unweathered sands consist of dark, basaltic minerals, of which volcanic lava on Earth is also composed. Basalt is the most widespread volcanic rock on Earth — and in the Solar System. Earth's ocean floor is made of basalt, as are the extinct volcanoes of the Eifel, Mount Etna in Sicily and volcanoes of the Hawaiian archipelago.\n\n\nIn my mind, the best bit is how much clearer you can see the various geographical features of the planet.

          "description": "According to recent research from linguists Phillip Carter and Kristen D'Alessandro Merii, a new dialect of English is forming in South Florida. The dialect, distinct from Spanglish, is spoken English that borrows lexical and semantic rules translated from Spanish. Carter writes:\nFor example, we found people to use expressions such as \"get down from the car\" instead of \"get out of the car.\" This is based on the Spanish phrase \"bajar del carro,\" which translates, for speakers outside of Miami, as \"get out of the car.\" But \"bajar\" means \"to get down,\" so it makes sense that many Miamians think of \"exiting\" a car in terms of \"getting down\" and not \"getting out.\"\nLocals often say \"married with,\" as in \"Alex got married with Jos'e,\" based on the Spanish \"casarse con\" — literally translated as \"married with.\" They'll also say \"make a party,\" a literal translation of the Spanish \"hacer una fiesta.\"\nWe also found \"semantic calques,\" or loan translations of meaning. In Spanish, \"carne,\" which translates as \"meat,\" can refer to both all meat, or to beef, a specific kind of meat. We discovered local speakers saying \"meat\" to refer specifically to \"beef\" — as in, \"I'll have one meat empanada and two chicken empanadas.\"\n\n\nI particularly liked this one:\nWe found that some expressions were used only among the immigrant generation — for example, \"throw a photo,\" from \"tirar una foto,\" as a variation of \"take a photo.\"\n\n\n Tags: language",

          "description": "This short video from Vox takes a look at the recent Supreme Court decision that struck down a gerrymandered congressional map in Alabama. \nIn 2013, a divided Supreme Court gutted one of the major pillars of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. In the 10 years since then, the court has moved even farther to the right. So when the Voting Rights Act came before the Supreme Court again in 2022, it didn't look good for the law. But then something completely unexpected happened: in a 5-4 decision, two of the conservative justices voted with the 3 liberal justices to preserve the Voting Rights Act. And the effects could be huge.\nAt stake in the case was the way that Alabama divides up its Congressional districts. Alabama has seven districts, one of which is what's called a \"majority-minority district\" in which Black Americans are the majority of the population. In 2022, a group of Black voters sued the state, saying that under the law, Alabama should actually have two majority-minority districts. And the Supreme Court agreed.\n\n\nThe decision could affect recently redrawn district maps in other states, which could in turn affect the balance of power in the House of Representatives. You can read more about these gerrymandering cases at the Brennan Center for Justice: Allen v. Milligan: Gerrymandering at the Supreme Court (Formerly Merrill v. Milligan) and Redistricting Litigation Roundup.\nTags: maps · politics · racism · Supreme Court · USA · video",

As a result, nearly all of the photos we see of those historic missions were made decades ago or are copies of copies. Recently, the film was cleaned and digitally scanned at \"an unprecedented resolution\".\nUsing these new high-res scans, image specialist Andy Saunders remastered each of the 35,000 photographs, resulting in this incredible-looking book, Apollo Remastered: The Ultimate Photographic Record. From the book's website:\nThe photographs from the lunar surface are as close as we can get to standing on the Moon ourselves, and for the first time, we were able to look back at Earth from afar, experiencing the \"overview effect\" — the cognitive shift that elicits an intense emotional experience upon seeing our home planet from space for the first time. The \"Blue Marble\" photograph, taken as Apollo 17 set course for the Moon, depicts the whole sunlit Earth, and is the most reproduced photograph of all time. Along with Apollo 8's \"Earthrise,\" which depicts Earth above the lunar horizon, it was a catalyst for the environmental movement that continues today.\n\n\nSaunders is also selling prints of some of these remastered photos, which look absolutely stunning.\nTags: Andy Saunders · Apollo · Apollo Remastered · books · NASA · photography · space",

Sometimes it happens after an injury, when a player is relearning how to throw, over-attending to discrete motions that used to feel fluid and natural. \"Overthinking\" is the simple way to put it: the brain's prefrontal cortex trips up the sensory cortex and the motor cortex. In other cases, the mind can essentially go blank. Players usually snap out of it, the way Bard had years before. But the brain can get stuck in certain patterns, and the yips can take over in a way that no one fully understands.\n\n\nI used to write quite a bit about the sort of practiced autopilot that's necessary to …",

Some say it's a Brechtian effect to expose the artifice of the mise en scène and have the audience reflect on the film medium. But Kubrick's films are not intellectual, despite what the critics say. \"The truth of a thing,\" Kubrick said, \"is in the feel of it, not in the think of it.\" If this look at the camera means anything, for me it means that we are not safe from Jack's …",

          "description": "To effectively combat the climate crisis, we're going to need to remove carbon from the atmosphere. But what's the best way to do it? Two of the main solutions being considered are direct carbon capture technology and growing trees and each approach has its pros and cons.\nCarbon removal is a catch-all term for anything that people do that pulls CO2 out of the air and stores it somewhere else. To meet the world's climate goals, we would need to do this on a massive scale — anywhere from 440 billion to 1.1 trillion metric tons before the end of the century. That's more carbon than the U.S. has emitted in its entire history.\nSo how do we remove all that carbon? There are two carbon removal ideas that have really captured the conversation. One is direct air capture, which involves big factories that suck in tons of CO2 from the atmosphere, chemically concentrate it, and store it deep in the ground. The other idea is to simply plant trees! After all, trees have naturally sequestered carbon for millions of years.\n\n\n(via digg)\nTags: climate crisis · video",

Here's Minkov explaining his full-galactic view:\nI've always wondered what the night sky would look like if we could see the two Milky Way arches from the winter and summer side by side. This is practically impossible, since they are part of a whole and are visible at different times of the day.\nHowever, this 360-degree time-blended panorama shows us what they would look like. The two arches of the Milky Way represent one object in the starry sky, with part of it visible in winter and part of it in summer. Therefore, they are called the winter and summer arches. The winter arch includes objects that we can observe from October to March, primarily associated with the constellation Orion.\nOn the other hand, the summer arch features the Milky Way core, visible from March to September, which is the most characteristic and luminous part of the night sky, representing the center of our galaxy.\n\n\n Tags: astronomy · best of · best of 2023 · Milky Way · photography",

          "description": "Ok this is kind of incredible: Brick Technology built a solar-powered Lego clock that will keep time for a billion years. It's got various displays in the style of an astronomical clock so you can keep track of seconds, hours, months, centuries, and even galactical years (the amount of time the Sun takes to orbit the center of the galaxy). The clock is powered by solar energy, and the solar cell is connected to the clock so that it tilts throughout the day to keep facing the sun. \nThis is a) an extremely accessible explanation of how clocks work, b) the nerdiest thing ever, and c) I love it so much. Even if you're not a Lego fan, you should watch this. (For more on how clocks work, check out Bartosz Ciechanowski's excellent explainer on mechanical watches.)\nThe obvious thing that sprung to mind watching this was The Clock of the Long Now, a 10,000-year clock being constructed inside a mountain in West Texas. But I also thought of Arthur Ganson's Machine With Concrete, which utilizes extreme gear ratios to turn an input of 200 rpm into a gear that turns only once every 2 trillion years. That's slow enough that the final gear is actually embedded in concrete and it doesn't affect the operation of the machine at all.\n\nSee also Here's What a Googol-to-One Gear Ratio Looks Like, 20 Mechanical Principles Combined in a Useless Lego Machine, and A Lego 5-Speed Manual Transmission.\nTags: Lego · time · video",

          "description": "In 2015, artist Olafur Eliasson designed the Circle Bridge (Cirkelbroen) to span a canal in central Copenhagen. The pedestrian bridge was designed to slow people down a bit:\nThe bridge is made of five circular platforms, and it contributes to a larger circle that will form a pedestrian route around Copenhagen Harbour, where people — cycling, running, walking — can see the city from a very different perspective. As many as 5,000 people will cross this bridge each day. I hope that these people will use Cirkelbroen as a meeting place, and that the zigzag design of the bridge will make them reduce their speed and take a break. To hesitate on our way is to engage in bodily thought. I see such introspection as an essential part of a vibrant city.\n\n\nSmall boats can travel easily under the bridge but a section of the bridge also swings gracefully away to let larger boats pass.

          "description": "In a Memorial Day reflection, historian Heather Cox Richardson highlights a pamphlet distributed by the US War Department to Army soldiers during World War II on the topic of fascism: what it is and how to combat it.\nThe War Department thought it was important for Americans to understand the tactics fascists would use to take power in the United States. They would try to gain power \"under the guise of 'super-patriotism' and 'super-Americanism.'\" And they would use three techniques:\nFirst, they would pit religious, racial, and economic groups against one another to break down national unity. Part of that effort to divide and conquer would be a \"well-planned 'hate campaign' against minority races, religions, and other groups.\"\nSecond, they would deny any need for international cooperation, because that would fly in the face of their insistence that their supporters were better than everyone else. \"In place of international cooperation, the fascists seek to substitute a perverted sort of ultra-nationalism which tells their people that they are the only people in the world who count. With this goes hatred and suspicion toward the people of all other nations.\"\nThird, fascists would insist that \"the world has but two choices — either fascism or communism, and they label as 'communists' everyone who refuses to support them.\"\nIt is \"vitally important\" to learn to spot native fascists, the government said, \"even though they adopt names and slogans with popular appeal, drape themselves with the American flag, and attempt to carry out their program in the name of the democracy they are trying to destroy.\"\n\n\nSee also The 14 Features of Eternal Fascism, How Fascism Works, Toni Morrison's Ten Steps Towards Fascism, and Fighting Authoritarianism: 20 Lessons from the 20th Century.\nTags: Heather Cox Richardson · politics · USA",

The telescope is still in a \"learning and transitioning period\" and not up to full operational speed, but scientists at the National Solar Observatory recently released a batch of images that hint at what it's capable of. Several of the photos feature sunspots, cooler regions of the Sun with strong magnetic fields.\nThe sunspots pictured are dark and cool regions on the Sun's \"surface\", known as the photosphere, where strong magnetic fields persist. Sunspots vary in size, but many are often the size of Earth, if not larger. Complex sunspots or groups of sunspots can be the source of explosive events like flares and coronal mass ejections that generate solar storms. These energetic and eruptive phenomena influence the outermost atmospheric layer of the Sun, the heliosphere, with the potential to impact Earth and our critical infrastructure.\nIn the quiet regions of the Sun, the images show convection cells in the photosphere displaying a bright pattern of hot, upward-flowing plasma (granules) surrounded by darker lanes of cooler, down-flowing solar plasma. In the atmospheric layer above the photosphere, called the chromosphere, we see dark, elongated fibrils originating from locations of small-scale magnetic field accumulations.\n\n\n(via petapixel)\nTags: astronomy · Inouye Solar Telescope · science · space · Sun",

The competitions have been held since the late 70s and today's mice are marvels of engineering and software, the result of decades of small improvements alongside bigger jumps in performance.\nI love stuff like this because the narrow scope (single vehicle, standard maze), easily understood constraints, and timed runs, combined with Veritasium's excellent presentation, makes it really easy to understand how innovation works. The cars got faster, smaller, and learned to corner better, but those improvements created new challenges which needed other solutions to overcome to bring the times down even more.

          "description": "Hand Talk sign language has been used by indigenous communities for thousands of years as a lingua franca between groups and tribes that didn't share a common spoken language. Hand Talk is an endangered endangered — the US government tried to eradicate indigenous languages starting the late 1800s — but it's still in use today.\nThis was fascinating. For example, as with all languages, Hand Talk vocabulary reveals how they thought about everyday concepts like time:\nFor example, let's take the simple question: \"How old are you?\" First, there's a single sign for \"question.\" So for a question about someone's age, you'd use the motion for question with the motion for \"winter\". How many winters are you? That's what I ask. In PISL you measure months by moons, days by the sun. And to refer to different times of day, you would show hand placement according to the position of the sun in the sky. So this sign for morning, afternoon, or night.\n\n\nHand Talk was also one of the influences on ASL and the borrowing of vocabulary between the two language groups continues.\nTags: language · Native Americans · video",

In the process, they missed World War II, the Moon landing, and the start of the Cold War.\n...beside a stream there was a dwelling. Blackened by time and rain, the hut was piled up on all sides with taiga rubbish-bark, poles, planks. If it hadn't been for a window the size of my backpack pocket, it would have been hard to believe that people lived there. But they did, no doubt about it.... Our arrival had been noticed, as we could see.\nThe low door creaked, and the figure of a very old man emerged into the light of day, straight out of a fairy tale. Barefoot. Wearing a patched and repatched shirt made of sacking. He wore trousers of the same material, also in patches, and had an uncombed beard. His hair was disheveled. He looked frightened and was very attentive.... We had to say something, so I began: 'Greetings, grandfather! We've come to visit!'\nThe old man did not reply immediately.... Finally, we heard a soft, uncertain voice: 'Well, since you have traveled this far, you might as well come in.'\n\n\t\nSuper fascinating.

Hidden behind the painting was an envelope containing a copy of the Declaration of Independence. It turned out to be one of approximately 200 copies of the Dunlap broadside, the first published copies of the historic document. From a contemporary NY Times article:\nMr. Redden described the document, found behind the painting when the collector took the frame apart, as an \"unspeakably fresh copy\" of the declaration. \"The fact that it has been in the backing of the frame preserved it,\" he said. Of the 24 copies known to survive, only 3 are in private hands, he added.\n\n\nHow \"unspeakably fresh\" was this particular copy? The ink wasn't yet dry when it was folded into the envelope:\n\"The ink was still wet on this copy when it was folded,\" Mr. Kiffer said. \"The very first line — 'In Congress, July 4, 1776' — shows up in the bottom margin in reverse, as a faint offsetting or shadow printing, one more proof of the urgency John Dunlap, the printer, and others felt in dispersing this document.\"\n\n\nThe document sold for $2.2 million in 1991 and then sold again in 2000 for $7.4 million to legendary TV producer Norman Lear (All in the Family, The Jeffersons), who mounted a three-and-a-half year tour of the it across the US.

A crew from the BBC recently made a short video tour, where you can see books on shelves designed to display fine china, an absence of windows, escalators, a lack of floor-to-ceiling walls, and fashion branding that remains on the walls.\nAlexandra Lange wrote about the school in 2021 for Curbed.\nThe genre may be nearly dead, yet the building remains. And for economic, ecological, and social reasons, those buildings should be reused. \"It's amazing to think that we are standing in what used to be a department store; that we're greeting people where we used to buy winter coats; reading books where they once sold fine china; taking phone calls in converted changing rooms; and learning science in the old suit racks,\" Burlington's school superintendent, Tom Flanagan, said at the ceremony. A school in a department store doesn't have to be a sad story. In fact, this should just be the beginning, both for the students and for a country once addicted to big boxes.\n\n\nVermont indie newspaper Seven Days published a writeup, video tour, and photo slideshow of the school when it opened two years ago.\nTags: Alexandra Lange · education · Vermont · video",

(Colloquially, it is often referred to as Ozempic, though that is technically just the brand name for semaglutide that is marketed for diabetes treatment.) Her food thoughts quieted down. She lost weight. But most surprisingly, she walked out of Target one day and realized her cart contained only the four things she came to buy. \"I've never done that before,\" she said. The desire to shop had slipped away. The desire to drink, extinguished once, did not rush in as a replacement either. For the first time — perhaps the first time in her whole life — all of her cravings and impulses were gone. It was like a switch had flipped in her brain.\n\n\nNot everyone experiences these effects, but there's enough anecdotal evidence at this point that scientists are interested and investigating.\nTags: addiction · drugs · medicine · Sarah Zhang · science",

It's based on the fantastic book by David Grann, Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI.\nIn the 1920s, the richest people per capita in the world were members of the Osage Nation in Oklahoma. After oil was discovered beneath their land, the Osage rode in chauffeured automobiles, built mansions, and sent their children to study in Europe.\nThen, one by one, the Osage began to be killed off. The family of an Osage woman, Mollie Burkhart, became a prime target. One of her relatives was shot. Another was poisoned. And it was just the beginning, as more and more Osage were dying under mysterious circumstances, and many of those who dared to investigate the killings were themselves murdered.\n\n\nThe movie will be out in theaters on October 6. Oh, and Scorsese & DiCaprio have already signed on to adapt Grann's latest book, The Wager, which I recently read and loved.\nTags: books · David Grann · Killers of the Flower Moon · Leonardo DiCaprio · Martin Scorsese · movies · trailers · video",

Today that figure is about 11%. And this decline wasn't just in the US — you can find the same trend in Australia, England, and Canada: today the majority of students are driven to school in a car. One of the larger studies we have on this issue in [British Columbia] found that 58% of 4th graders and 50% of 7th graders were driven to school by their parents.\n\n\nThere are various reasons for this shift, including that roads are unsafe for cyclists and pedestrians because of cars, a cultural shift towards greatly increased parental supervision of children, and inflexible parental work schedules.\nTags: cars · video",

The more that your eyes adjust, the more saturated the blue gets. It's a surreal visual experience that you cannot get from any photo of an ice cave.\"\n\n\nIf you'd like to see some of these places for yourself, Newburn runs a tour company called Ice Pic Journeys.\nTags: Iceland · photography · Ryan Newburn",

People choose to drop out of their lives for different reasons, ranging from debt or abuse to mental health struggles or a lack of second chances in Japanese society. Some Japanese who want to go into hiding or relocate from domestic abuse or stalkers hire \"night movers\" to help them disappear.\nFor more info, here's a long piece from Time magazine from 2017.\nSometimes a whole team works on a client's disappearance, swiftly sweeping through an apartment in the dead of night. At TS, it costs between ¥50,000 ($450) and ¥300,000 ($2,600) depending on the amount of possessions somebody wants to flee with, how far they're going, and whether the move needs to happen under the cover of darkness. Taking along children, or evading debt collectors, can push prices higher. Every day, TS receives between five and 10 inquiries like the one Saita described. Most people simply require counseling or legal advice but the company claims to help between 100 and 150 people to vanish annually.\n\n\n Tags: Japan · video",

Some are relatively small:\nFirst up is 1601+3113, a dwarf galaxy hosting a black hole packed with the mass of 100,000 Suns. The matter is so compressed that even the black hole's shadow is smaller than our Sun.\n\n\nWhile others are much larger than the solar system...and this isn't even the biggest one:\nAt the animation's larger scale lies M87's black hole, now with a updated mass of 5.4 billion Suns. Its shadow is so big that even a beam of light — traveling at 670 million mph (1 billion kph) — would take about two and a half days to cross it.\n\n\n Tags: astronomy · black holes · NASA · physics · science · video",

          "description": "In this short film by Sarah Klein & Tom Mason, Christen O'Brien tells the story of how she almost died from a massive pulmonary embolism, what she experienced in those moments, and what she took from the experience. The film is based on an essay she wrote called What It Felt Like to Almost Die.1\nRealizing that I was dying was like being pushed into a pool. You have no thought but to hold your breath and start swimming. It was the most out of control I'd ever been in my life, yet the only option was to succumb peacefully. I could hear the percussion of my heart beating wildly, recklessly. My breath only reached my trachea now, its pathway closing in rapidly. My palms spread open to the sky, just as my dog moved to stand over me. I am here with you, I am here to protect you.\n\n\nO'Brien wrote a follow-up to her original post, How It Felt to Come Back to Life:\nComing back from death showed me that the journey of life is not what we often believe. On the surface, it appears as a journey outward — toward things, people, organizations, achievements. But in truth, it is a journey inward — toward the soul. Toward becoming who you actually are, no matter how far outward you may have to travel in order to discover that all the answers are within you, where you belong.\n\n\n\nThe filmmakers first read O'Brien's story via a link from kottke.org. It doesn't happen that often, but I love it when things I feature go on to inspire others to create things of their own. Just doing my bit to complete the loop.↩\n\nTags: Christen O'Brien · death · Sarah Klein · Tom Mason · video",

SineRider, a project started by Chris Walker and finished by a group of teen hackers at Hack Club, is a version of Line Rider where you use math equations to draw curves to maneuver the sledder through a series of points, sometimes in a certain order. Here's a trailer with some gameplay examples:\n\nLet me tell you, I haven't had this much fun mucking around with an online game/toy since I don't know when. My math is super rusty, but SineRider eases you into the action with some simple slopes (no cosines or tangents necessary) and before you know it, it's 20 minutes later and you're googling equations for parabolas.\nRight now, there are two ways to play. You can start on the front page and go through a progression of puzzles that get more challenging as more concepts are introduced (such as the curve changing over time). Or you can do the challenges, which are posted daily to Twitter or Reddit. My son and I spent 10-15 minutes solving these two challenges and we were laughing and cheering when we finally got them. (The educational opportunity here is obvious...)\nSineRider is currently in beta so some of the UI stuff is a little rough around the edges, but I was really charmed by the music, the animations...everything really. The project is open source — the code is available on GitHub and the Hack Club folks are looking for contributors and collaborators:\nThere's a reason it's open-source and written in 100% vanilla JavaScript. We need volunteer artists, writers, programmers, and puzzle designers. And, if you're a smart teenager who wants to change education for the better, you should come join Hack Club!\n\n\n Tags: mathematics · SineRider · video · video games",

Xane was the best Meta Knight player in the midwest during the height of his Super Smash Bros. career. She asked him what a $250,000 prize pool was.

My wife will sometimes dig it out to play on airplanes and long car rides. She's weirdly good at it. She can get 500 or 600 lines, no problem.\"\nWhat Flewin said next I will never forget.\n\"Oh, my!\"\nAfter I hung up the phone, I went to the bedroom and woke my wife, Lori.\n\"Honey,\" I said. \"You're not going to believe this, but I just got off the phone with a guy who's in charge of video game world records, and he said the world record for Game Boy Tetris is 327 lines, and he wants us to go to New Hampshire this spring so you can try to break the world record live in front of the judges at the world's largest classic video game tournament.\n\n\nSpoiler alert: she broke the record. Baker is still 5th on the all-time scoring list but her score was bested just three months later by Harry Hong, the original record holder, who achieved a score six times higher than Baker's.

          "description": "Microsoft Excel is an extremely powerful, complex, and useful software program that millions of people know how to use, at least a little bit. For those who are experts, there are now esports competitions in Microsoft Excel that pit the best spreadsheet jockeys against each other. Here's what that looks like:\n\nIt's....a little confusing to watch if you aren't that good at Excel yourself. From a piece in the Atlantic late last year:\nYes, we are talking about people competing in Microsoft Excel, the famous (and famously boring) spreadsheet software that you may have used in school or at work or to track your finances. In competitive Excel, players square off in test-taking showdowns, earning points each time they answer a question correctly. Players' screens are a whirlwind of columns and keystrokes and formulae; if the terms XLOOKUP, RANDBETWEEN, and dynamic array don't mean anything to you, you are unlikely to understand what's going on. The commentators help, but only to a point. Even so, you can always follow the scoreboard, which tends to change suddenly and drastically. With just over three minutes to play, Ngai nailed a set of questions and jumped out to a 416-390 lead. GolferMike1 began to rethink his earlier assessment: \"Uh oh. We got a game.\"\n\n\nThere's a pretty good explanation of what some of the challenges are like starting at the 6-minute mark in this video:\n\nIf you'd like more information, check out the Microsoft Excel World Championship for 2023 — the finals are in Las Vegas this year, they're gonna show it on one of ESPN's channels, and there's more than $15,000 in prize money at stake.\nTags: Excel · sports · video",

It happens in nature when huge volcanic eruptions cover the stratosphere with ash: That ash forms a layer that reflects sunlight and cools the planet underneath. Solar geoengineering takes advantage of that principle, using different scientific methods to make the planet more reflective overall. The problem is, deploying it would require messing with our very complicated climate on a massive scale, and many scientists don't think the risks are worth it.\n\n\n Tags: climate crisis · science · video",

But it's fascinating what happens. The crowd, being a crowd, does not initially do what it should, which is rush the experts and take them out right away with little regard for individual survival. But pretty much every person fights for themselves. And instead of getting easier for the Musketeers near the end, it gets more difficult. The few remaining crowd members start working together more effectively. The survival of the fittest effect kicks in. The remaining experts get sloppy, tired, and perhaps a little overconfident. The ending was a genuine shock. (via digg)\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n[This was originally posted on May  1, 2014.]\nTags:fencing    \nsports    \nTV    \nvideo",

Brought to Cuba as laborers, these migrants and their Cuban-Chinese progeny developed a cuisine that blended Chinese and Caribbean flavors.\nAfter the Cuban Revolution in 1959, many Cuban Chinese left the island and some established Cuban Chinese food restaurants in the United States, mainly in New York City and Miami. Some diners contend that Cuban-Chinese food is more Cuban than Chinese.\nThere are also other genres of Chinese-Latin and Asian-Latin food blends created by Asian migrants to Latin America over the last two centuries.\n\n\nSee also Chinese Latinos Explain Chino-Latino Food and from The Village Voice in 2014, The Definitive Guide to NYC’s Chinese-Latin American Restaurants, many of which, like La Dinastia, are still around.\nTags: food · NYC · restaurants · video",

I will never tire of watching raptors hovering in the wind, their wings & bodies making dozens of micro-adjustments a second so that they can keep their heads perfectly still and focused on searching for prey on the ground below. From The Kid Should See This:\nLike hummingbirds and kingfishers, kestrels have the advantage of a larger accessory optic system, a sort of superhero power that detects movement and helps keep their balance, enabling unparalleled head stabilization while hovering. By bobbing their heads periodically, kestrels can estimate distances and locate prey, sometimes by seeing urine trails with their ultraviolet-sensitive vision.\n\n\nWatch until the end to see a kestrel eating a still-writhing snake. 😳\nSee also The Perfect Head Stabilization of a Hunting Red-Tailed Hawk, This Owl Will Not Move His Head, and The Eerie Stillness of Chicken Heads.\nTags: birds · Paul Dinning · video",

This timelapse video shows the construction of a much larger ship: a modern-day, 1,100-foot-long cruise ship that houses 6,600 passengers. The size of this thing is just ridiculous, bordering on the obscene. It took me a second to realize that the giant thing they were constructing in the first minute of the video is in fact an engine, which, when compared to the rest of the ship, is not that big at all. Make sure you watch to the end to see the oddball paint job on the bow.\nSee also a timelapse of a second ship of this class being built, which focuses on different details.

Carving is all about having deep cuts here and lighter here and the angle here and how the light plays on it. And certainly in relief...because relief carving like this, it's kind of halfway between sculpture and drawing. If you're doing a three-dimensional sculpture, if a form runs around the back you just carve it so it goes around the back, but with this you have to give the illusion of it running around the back like a drawing. You've got to make something look like it turns around and comes out the other side even though it really is just going into the block. And that's all about angles and shadow and light.\n\n\n Tags: art · Donatello · how to · Simon Smith · video",
