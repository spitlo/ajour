          "description": "The game went live just under a week ago and the feedback has been really nice to see.\nThere's been a balance of \"regular\" players and power players, and in those power players is where the game got some more much needed play testing.\nThe one thing that I had designed into the game was the unlimited undo. The side effect was that, technically, there's infinite ability to make your way through the game so long as you had time and patience - a lot of patience!\nThe knock on problem with infinite moves is that the score really isn't infinite. In fact, I alluded to that in a previous devlog because the score is a 16bit value, it has a max range.\nSo with that, this new release adds a penalty to using the undo. I went through a lot of different ideas and tested them out to see how they affected the score. Here's just a few that I tried:\n\nSubtracting 100 points per undo\nHalving the score per undo\nSubtracting the number of blocks restored\nUsing the undo depth as a multiplier - as in: if you undo twice, the penalty is greater\n\nThese had either drastic effects on the score, which made it pointless, or very subtle effects which rendered the penalty ineffective.\nWhat I settled on was using your progress as the multiplier. So, undo costs 25 points per undo on level 1. On level 2, it costs 50 points, level 3 75 points and so on.\nThis changes the dynamic of the game in a really interesting way. You start to consider the impact on your decisions against your score: do I continue with undo and risk it, or do I accept the fate of stable score and hope it's good enough for a highscore?\nThere was also some fixes for the custom themes - around the palette because I require a custom palette for the game's main tiles, but when you add your own custom tiles the game switches to the default Layer 2 palette - so there were fixes around that too. And here's Gaz Mashall's own custom theme in action behind a new user interface change:",

Still, I think it's looking pretty snazzy:\n\nAll the same, the itch download page is primed and ready for release on Saturday. There's two downloads available: the game and the game with fully documented source code and PDF overview article.\nIn lieu of the release, I've been looking back at the original version I wrote in the early 2000s and found a web based Palm Pilot emulator that let me actually play and capture screenshots of the original game (I even managed to recover the source code and published it on github). So I present to you - the old version:\n\nOnce the game is live for the Spectrum I'll release the web version and if I planned the code right, we'll all be able to contribute to the high score leader board!",

          "description": "When using postgres locally for development, sometimes, if the production dataset is too large, I'll take a sample to work with locally.\nMore recently I've run into the problem that when I load new production data into tables with auto increment primary key columns, I'll get a conflict, i.e. I load some production data in locally, and then when the auto increment runs it'll hit a conflict - because my local sequences are completely out of sync with production.\nThe solution is to update my local sequence value. This is a two part process.\n1. Capture current values from production:\nSELECT last_value FROM public.<table>_<col>_seq;\n\nSo for something like user ids, this would be:\nSELECT last_value FROM public.user_id_seq;\n>>> 304\n\nIf this doesn't yield a result, then the sequence name is wrong, and it can be checked with the following query:\nSELECT pg_get_serial_sequence('user', 'id');\n\nNow armed with this value, in my example 304, the next part is to upload locally:\n2. Update sequences locally:\nALTER SEQUENCE <table>_<col>_seq RESTART WITH <next_value>;\n\nIt's important that I update to the next value, not the current value:\nALTER SEQUENCE user_id_seq RESTART WITH 305;\n\nNow when the next id for the user is loaded through an insert, the sequences are in sync.",

If you are very lucky, someone else will find uses for it you never intended, or that even challenge the premise of the language.\n\r\nThis is not the same as using the language in an unexpected way. Urban Müller could not have foreseen brainfuck as the bedrock for a Rust-like language or a CPU. But do these projects truly counter brainfuck's premise? I would argue not. Brainfuck appears chaotic but part of its appeal has always been in conquering that chaos, in building efficient algorithms using the language despite the challenge. These projects counter the chaos of brainfuck, but that really is the appeal of brainfuck in the first place, they are simply taking it much further than could have been anticipated. If Müller had wanted brainfuck to be impossible to master, he would have designed the language much differently.\n\r\nSometimes, however, a language inspires work that falls very far from the intent of its original designer. Most esolangs, like mainstream programming languages, are open systems and don't dictate how programmers use them. C# offers many features to make structured code easy.

In the same way that we wouldn’t do any research without the right questions to get the insights that we need, the best way to ask for feedback is also to craft sharp questions.\nDesign critique is not a one-shot process.
