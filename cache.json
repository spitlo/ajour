We'll also be reporting in our on position in the world, and on our future plans.\nSummary Of Changes\n100r.co, added propeller maintenance, Maple Bay, Telegraph Cove, Smuggler Cove and Princess Louisa Inlet.\nWiktopher, added back the revised/corrected version of Chapter 10, back online, and Chapter 11 has been corrected but is not yet live.\nUxnFor, created an uxntal code formatter.\nBicycle, added lots of little improvements.\nAdelie, added speaker's notes and a pen mode.\nNews\nPino spent the first few days of the month on land, having its bottom re-painted, and its various bits serviced and checked. We took our propeller apart for the first time.\nWe've added a few write-ups of our travels so far (see above entry with links under 100r.co), but the most significant one is our 46nmi sail up to Princess Louisa Inlet, a long fjord on British Columbia's Sunshine Coast, with an incredible gem at the end. It is an amazing, and unique place. We're glad we finally got to go. As we write this, we are in Roscoe Bay on West Redonda Island, tethering off a phone hoisted up the mast (it works quite well).\nThis summer we are power stable. We had issues last year because of parisitic draws due to old wiring (see DC electrical refit), but now everything is working as it should. We're charging our computers without an inverter, and that too is working out quite well so far (see charging electronics).\nTogether, Hikari and Lynn made chibicc-uxn, a c compiler for Uxn, and with it also released a port of the classic software Neko(xneko, oneko sakura).\nPino book & movie club\nWe are reading Arkady and Boris Strugatsky's Roadside Picnic.

We can show the user the UTC time, but when it doesn't match the wall clock because they're currently observing DST, then it's just…weird.\nSo now we need to know if the location is observing DST, or not. Or if perhaps they never observe DST (like Hawaii).\nThe long hard way\nThere is the IANA timezone dataset which has custom data structures that describe the location and how time is observed in that…",

The original Wonder Swan can do eight shades of grey and has no backlight (very much like the original Game Boys for viewing).\nGiven my experience with Game Boys and recent (basic) electronics, I thought I'd try my hand at a backlight mod (where LEDs are used light up behind the display). I'm pretty happy with the final result and this is how I did it.\n\nBuild steps\nFor the backlight, I used a faulty DS Lite display - both bottom or top screen will work as we're only interested in the LED and filters.\n\nFrom the DS Lite display, remove the metal shielding from the back, remove the front polarizer (I'm guessing) and then separate the back (whit…",

          "description": "Cutting to the chase: text editors *and* tabs vs. spaces!  Ooooh!\n\n\nI've had this thing called \"e\" for a while now.  It's a stupid little \nscript which serves to do a couple of things.  It starts my \neditor\nwith a given file, and it kicks it with the right arguments to make it \ndisable line wrapping and to make the [TAB] key actually put in two \nspaces.\n\n\nSo, my dumb script would use \"-w -E -T 2\" most of the time, except when it \nwas running on a Makefile, at which point it would skip those args.  \nSimple enough, right?\n\n\npico is back?  Yes indeed, on Macs, as of 12.3, pico is in fact back.  To \nmake sure I wasn't imagining things, I tracked down a machine that hadn't \nbeen upgraded yet and checked there.  Sure enough, it was in fact nano and \nnot pico.\n\n\nmacOS 12.3 has nano as a symlink... pointing to pico!\n\n\nAt some point, I switched from literal tab characters in my source code to \nblobs of spaces, probably due to using that style at work and not hating \nit.  So, somewhere along the line I actually started depending on nano \nbehavior without realizing it.\n\n\nAs for the lack of a feature in pico itself, it's kind of strange, really.  \nIf you go digging into the source, they have this random.c with a function \ncalled tab which claims to \"simulate tab stop\" using spaces.  That said, I \ncan't find any place where it would be called with the magic values which \nwould make it behave that way.\n\n\nIt wouldn't surprise me if this switch is just more of Apple removing \nGPLed things from their OS - pico seems to use the Apache license.  They \ndumped bash for zsh (MIT license) at some point (Big Sur, I think), and \nnow this?  Okay then.",

          "description": "Here's a very old and stupid trick you could do with some filesystems in \nsome situations back in the day... and might still be able to do in a \nfew places today.\n\n\nThe problem is that while version X might eventually have an exploit, \nit'll get removed and it'll be replaced by version Y without that\nparticular hole.  By the time you get your hands on a tool to break into \nX, it'll be gone.\n\n\nWhat you'd do is create a hard link pointing at the file you wanted to \npreserve, storing it in a spot which was writable by your account.  \nThen, say, /usr/bin/sudo (because that never has security \nissues...) gets replaced at some point with a new file and you get to \nkeep the old version.  When you get the tool to pop it, off you go!\n\n\nOf course, these days, it's not quite so easy on the more modern systems \nyou find.  Debian 11 here won't let me do it - it's EPERM city.  Rocky 8 \n(so CentOS 8 and RHEL 8 too) also won't do it.  They both have some gunk\nin /usr/lib/sysctl.d to lock this down.  But, my old Slackware 14.2 \ninstall of my workstation let me do it the last time I tried about \na year ago.  How about that, huh?  I bet it'd still work if I dug out \nthe old drives and booted them up.\n\n\nIncidentally, this is the magic sauce: /proc/sys/fs/protected_hardlinks\nRead the man page for proc(5) to learn more about it.\n\nhere it is,\nthe thread I read a long time ago.  It's interesting to note that as far \nas I can tell, nothing actually changed upstream.  This left paranoid \nadmins like me with no option but to use the (most excellent) Openwall \npatches to lock down this kind of stuff.  I used that on my machines at \nwork which had non-staff users... just in case.\n\n\nThis whole situation is scary.  \nRead more about it.",

          "description": "One of the fun things I used to do at a prior job was to dig through the \nraw data points which were collected from the *many* servers we had.  I \ncould just pick an interesting-sounding metric and then would just ask \nthe system to show me the top 10 or bottom 10 out of a population of \nthousands or more.\n\n\nTo get my feet wet with the whole \"investigations\" thing that we'd do, I \nstarted looking into this one day and chose one of the many temp sensors \nwhich were being logged by the servers.  I forget exactly which one it \nwas, for there were many.  The CPUs logged it, the chassis logged it, \nthe power supply logged it, and so on.  There were so many choices.\n\n\nI went looking for a reason.  What could possibly explain this?  First \noff, it didn't line up with any obvious pattern in the host names.  The \nhosts were named for whichever team owned them, followed by a sequence \nnumber that was bumped any time a new one was provisioned.  There was no \nsignal to be found in that.\n\n\nThere was more, though.  You could also see a \"rack position\" in this \ndata, and now it started getting interesting.  It seems that all of the \nreally hot machines had a rack position of something low, like 04 or 05, \nand never anything higher than that.  In fact, when looking at a whole \nrack, it was always the lowest number of all of the positions that were \nbeing used.  Now this was worth chasing!\n\n\nIt's good that I asked, since they told me something surprising: \nposition 04 or 05 or whatever was the *bottom* of the rack.  Yes, \nsomehow, the lowest machine in the rack was the hottest!  They found \nthis interesting, too, and wound up digging into it.  Given that I was \nfar away in a distant office, this was the best way for us to proceed.\n\n\nThe problem was that the bottommost server would have nothing below it \nbut just open space until it got to the floor.  That space would not \nmove air efficiently, and it obviously mattered.\n\n\nThis rolled out and my hot spots disappeared.  Fantastic!",

In short, it looks like every Raspberry Pi filesystem installed \nfrom any given release image probably ends up with the same\nUUID.\n\n\nFor instance, if you downloaded the \"lite\" version of Raspbian between \nroughly November 8th and January 28th, you probably got a file called \n2021-10-30-raspios-bullseye-armhf-lite.zip.  Inside, there's an image, \nand the idea is that you dump that straight to your SD card, cram it in \nthe Pi, and off you go.  The second partition on that image is an ext4 \nfilesystem which was created on some build machine somewhere.  The UUID \non it never gets \"evolved\" to something else after the install.\n\n\nYou can see it inside the image itself here:\n\n\nOr, if you actually installed a few of these things like I did over the \npast couple of months, you can just 'tune2fs -l /dev/mmcblk0p2' and see \nthe same value in there.\n\n\nDon't end up with a pile of SD cards on your desk and think \"I know, \nI'll use the filesystem UUIDs to track which one goes where\", in other \nwords.\n\n\nIf it's not breaking anything for you, it's probably best to just let it \nbe.  Untangling a boot mess on these weird little boxes is anything but \nfun.\n\nNote: if you're actually on a recent Raspberry Pi, odds are good that \nyour /etc/fstab will be using *partition* UUIDs (PARTUUID=...) and not \nthose of the filesystem.

          "description": "Right now, the Portland, OR area is suffering through a heat wave, with high temperatures some 20-25°F above normal. Earlier this year, meteorologist Guy Walton began naming North American heatwaves after oil companies:\nObviously, I'm naming heatwaves to highlight this worsening climate problem and perhaps save lives by getting the public to focus on this weather threat. This year I'm naming major heatwaves after oil companies to shame them in the process and to identify culprits that are exacerbating these deadly systems.\n\n\nPortland's hot spell, the fourth heatwave of the summer, is named Heatwave Citgo...having been preceded by Heatwave Amoco, Heatwave BP, and Heatwave Chevron. Next up on the list:\n5. Conoco (Phillips)\nAnd several more as needed. Here's Walton's criteria for choosing what constitutes a nameable heatwave (mirroring the scale for hurricanes):\nCAT 3: A major level heatwave severe enough such that a few fatalities are reported. A city in a CAT 3 heat wave would be under a heat emergency for a few days. Many heat records would be either tied or broken.\nA CAT3 or higher heatwave would be considered to be a major heatwave and would get a fossil fuel corporation name.\n\n\nThe highest category of heatwave is CAT5:\nCAT 5. Catastrophic heat wave. Many all-time temperature records would be shattered with thousands of deaths reported. Remember the European heat wave of 2003 in which there were well in excess of 10,000 fatalities? This event would certainly fit my CAT 5 category.\n\n\nThe media should actually start using these more widely. (via @dens)\nTags: climate crisis · Guy Walton · language · USA",

          "description": "The other day when I posted about iconic hip-hop samples from the past 50 years, I noticed a name that featured prominently in the early years: Sylvia Robinson. Robinson was the CEO and co-founder of the very first rap record label, Sugar Hill Records. She produced the first rap record, Rapper's Delight, and the seminal The Message, widely regarded as one of the best and most influential rap and hip-hop tracks ever.\nFrom an essay written on the occasion of her induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2022:\nSylvia Robinson played many roles in the music world — artist, producer, and, most notably, record executive. But as the founder and leader of the pioneering Sugar Hill label, she revealed herself to be something even rarer. She was a visionary.\nIn 1979, \"Rapper's Delight\" by the Sugarhill Gang introduced hip-hop to the global mainstream, illustrating the genre's commercial and creative potential. Robinson had overseen the record's backing track, assembled the group members, and arranged their vocals — but fundamentally, it was her idea that rap was even viable as recorded music. Her place in history would be secured by that track alone, though it was far from her only impact on the direction of pop.\n\n\nHere's a short video that covers the high points of her career:\n\nIt's sad that Robinson and her achievements haven't been more widely known — this seems like another case (as in computing and other industries) where women played an early vital role and were then forgotten.\nTags: hip-hop · music · Sylvia Robinson · video",

          "description": "The Illustrated Book of Poultry by Lewis Wright, first published in 1870 and revised several times in the decades following, was \"regarded as the most desirable of the English poultry books\". Poultry was very popular in Victorian England and the book housed a tremendous amount of practical poultry knowledge. From a Harvard Library blog post:\n\"Hen Fever\", as it became known during the Victorian Age, was an unprecedented obsession with owning, breeding, and showing the finest chickens in the world. The genesis of the poultry fancier owes much to Queen Victoria and her royal menagerie. In 1842, she acquired exotic chickens from China, and whatever the Queen did, the public would soon try to imitate and incorporate at home. The Illustrated London News reported \"Her Majesty's collection of fowls is very considerable, occupying half-a-dozen very extensive yards, several small fields, and numerous feeding-houses, laying-sheds, hospitals, winter courts, &c.\". From this point forward, poultry was no longer viewed as common farmyard critters, but valued and appreciated throughout the classes of Victorian Britain. The import and breeding of poultry was not just a leisurely hobby, but a profitable endeavor with sky rocketing price tags for the finest examples.\n\n\t\nBut the books also contained many wonderful illustrations of the finest examples of chickens and other poultry in the style of Audubon. The different breeds have amazing names like Buff Orpingtons, Plymouth Rocks, Dark Dorkingtons, and Gold Pencilled Hamburghs.\nI pulled the images above from a 1911 edition of the book. (via @john_overholt)\nUpdate: I removed a link to a reproduction of the book on Amazon because a reader reported that the quality was not great.

Molchanov pulled himself down and up using a guide rope without fins.\nA CWT dive that took 4m 13s and went to a depth of 133 meters (442 feet). CWT is when the diver uses a monofin and weight belt to dive and return to the surface.\n\nHis complete record-breaking dives are embedded above and are completely suspenseful to watch even though you know the outcome. They're almost like watching someone meditate instead of compete in an extreme sport. Molchanov needs to expend some energy and oxygen getting down and back, but also can't over-exert himself. A lot of it is just being relaxed and calm — this is truly a mind-over-matter discipline.\nI've written about Molchanov before,1 riffing off of this profile of him in GQ.\nWhen Alexey was younger, his mother, Natalia Molchanova, was the world's best freediver, a distinction that she held for many years. She was a pioneer in the sport and the practitioner of a mind-and-body-control technique called \"attention deconcentration.\" She passed her secrets to her son, who perfected them and uses the regimen to reach a state of intense calm. By doing so, he can slow his heart rate, his metabolic rate, while simultaneously slowing the activity of his brain and his body. His focus deepens. He relaxes to the point of seeming asleep. He takes deep, drowsy breaths, like a summer breeze filling a sail.\n\n\nI will never not be fascinated by freediving.\n\nAnd his mother Natalia, who was probably the best freediver ever and taught Alexey how. Natalia disappeared while diving in 2015 and is presumed dead.↩\n\nTags: Alexey Molchanov · free diving · sports · video",

For a year and a half, the company tried to work out the problem to no avail. One day, workers were reminiscing about an ex-employee, Irving, who didn't come to work at the new factory due to the long commute required. Irving's job was to move the sausages from the filling room to the smokehouse, taking them on a half hour journey through a maze of rooms where other products were getting produced. After noting this absence, it clicked that Irving's daily trip was the secret ingredient — on his journey the sausages were getting pre-cooked and infused with flavor. The company was eventually able to recreate the sausages' original taste, building a brand new room onto the factory which emulated the properties of Irving's trip.\n\n\n(via robin sloan)\nTags: Anna Pendergrast · business · Kelly Pendergrast",

          "description": "Craig Mod has my favorite take to date on Oppenheimer: that it should have been more like Richard Rhodes' The Making of the Atomic Bomb:\nMy ideal version of this film would have begun in the 1900s or '10s, with flashes of Relativity and then the steps of Quantum Mechanics with Planck, Bohr, and Heisenberg. Quantum tunneling with Gamow and Gurney. The nuclear shell model with Maria Goeppert Mayer and J. Hans D. Jensen. Chadwick's discovery of the neutron. Anderson's positron unveiling. Hold the camera longer on Lawrence and his cyclotron. What's going on there? (I mean, ya got Josh Hartnett's pretty head, plaster it up!) Shoot in high-grade mega-IMAX-bokeh the oddly simple experimental setups, the beakers, the blips, the radiation tick-tick-ticks, the iterations, the step-by-step expansion of understanding the fabric of everything around us. Give us an hour of this, this arguably greatest moment of human insight. You can still call the film Oppenheimer. Let the man loom, weave him between it all as he makes his way through Europe, sets up at Berkeley, is selected to lead Los Alamos. Ramp up the Nazi threat. Show the diaspora of brilliance more clearly. Believe the audience is willing to sit through more than just \"Is it a wave ... or is it particle?\" Oh! There is so much excitement, so much incredible science to be mined, and Nolan mined so little.\n\n\nMod and I both share a love for that masterpiece of a book and I would watch the hell out of an 10-part HBO series (in the vein of Chernobyl) based on it, American Prometheus, and John Hersey's Hiroshima.\nTags: atomic bomb · books · Craig Mod · movies · Oppenheimer · physics · science · The Making of the Atomic Bomb · World War II",

          "description": "Produced by Venus & Serena Williams and US soccer star Alex Morgan and directed by Rachel Ramsay & James Erskine, Copa 71 is a forthcoming documentary about a women's soccer tournament that took place in Mexico City in 1971 that was the first, albeit unofficial, Women's World Cup. A short teaser trailer is above. From a piece in Variety about the film:\nIn August 1971, more than 100,000 football fans packed Mexico City's Azteca Stadium for a historic tournament. Teams from England, France, Denmark, Argentina and Italy flew in for 21 days of matches alongside Mexico's national team, while eager sponsors lined up for a piece of the action. The players, who received a hero's welcome wherever they went, might as well have been the Rolling Stones.\nThey were, in fact, a group of around 100 women — many of them teenagers — taking part in a pioneering unofficial Women's World Cup. And just as quickly as they tasted fame, it was snatched away as the tournament was all but erased from football history.\n\n\nMany of the competitors were just teenagers — from Wikipedia:\nEngland's team included 13-year-old Leah Caleb, 14-year-old Gill Sayell, and 15-year-old Chris Lockwood; their captain was 19-year-old Carol Wilson and they were accompanied by referee Pat Dunn as a chaperone and trainer. 15-year-old Susanne Augustesen scored a hat-trick for Denmark as they beat Mexico 3-0 in the final.\n\n\nCopa 71 is premiering at the Toronto Film Festival in September and then hopefully will find its way into theaters and onto streaming.

And how can we find it in our daily lives? Explore steps you can take to increase your chances of finding flow.\n\n\nWhile I am not feeling particularly in the groove today, over the past several weeks I've been in the flow state a lot, working on a couple of projects for the site. It's been a long time since I've had that feeling for more than a couple of hours every few months and booooooy does it feel good. There is almost nothing that fills me with as much joy as the \"effortless engagement\" of being in the flow state. I'm very glad it's back in my life — I'd been afraid it was gone forever.

The whole thread is worth a read...here are a couple of Zipper's points:\nTall vehicles have bigger blind spots and are more likely to strike a person's torso or head. Heavier vehicles exert more force crashing into a person, bicycle, or smaller car. They also have longer braking distances.\n\n\n\nHeavier cars exert more pressure on tires, eroding them faster. Tire particles are absorbed into water, where they damage ecosystems. They also float through the air, harming human health when ingested.\n\n\nFor further reading, Zipper links to a number of pieces he's written in recent months: The Blatant Greenwashing of SUVs, EVs Are Sending Toxic Tire Particles Into the Water, Soil, and Air, Carry That Weight, and The Car Safety Feature That Kills the Other Guy. Zipper's solution to these problems is government action: for example, taxing vehicles by weight, testing vehicles for pedestrian and cyclist safety, or requiring drivers have commercial driver's licenses for larger vehicles.\nThe image above is from Carsized and compares a 2018 Dodge Ram to a 2005 VW Jetta.\nTags: cars · David Zipper · USA",

DeSantis and Greg Abbott, the Texas governor, have also banned it from schools.\nHere again, though, there's no evidence of a public threat. CRT simply teaches America's history of racism, which students need to understand to be informed citizens.\nBanning it is a scare tactic to appeal to a largely white, culturally conservative voter base.\n\n\nHowever, I would argue that Reich needed to go a bit further. While the crises are inventions, their consequences go beyond mere distraction and into the territory of active harm, particularly of queer and trans people, Black people, and people of color.

          "description": "From Adam Kovacs' YouTube channel Adam Something comes this brisk 10-minute video essay on why European malls are doing better than their American progenitors. I thought his third point, about poor urban planning, was particularly interesting: malls tend to fail in America because they are not integrated into the fabric of towns and cities (because very little is integrated into the fabric of cities and towns in many places these days).\nMalls, hell, all commerce has to be an organic part of towns and cities. People should be able to get to them by means other than a car, and conveniently. Such integrated commercial spaces are far more resilient. If your commercial spaces aren't resilient — if you just plop a big box outside the town — don't be surprised when it goes bust in a few years. And then it's bulldozed for the next thing to be put up for it to go bust the same way and then get bulldozed and then the next thing and the next and the next so on and so forth.\n\n\n Tags: Adam Kovacs · cities · economics · Europe · USA · video",

However, their relationship had gone pear-shaped and they were in the process of breaking up when we recorded 'Nothing Compares 2 U', so that's probably why she did such a good vocal. She came into the studio, did it in one take, double-tracked it straight away and it was perfect because she was totally into the song.

          "description": "Cruise ships are a relatively new human invention that look quite different from other ships. Oh, and they are absolutely massive. How did they get that way?\nThe predecessor of today's cruise ships was the ocean liner: big, beautiful ships that sailed across the Atlantic. But ocean liners had a totally different purpose from cruise ships: They were for transportation. Everything about them was designed to facilitate an ocean voyage from one continent to another.\nBut air travel changed that. Planes eliminated the main reason to take a ship somewhere, and ocean liner business plummeted. So the industry pivoted and began selling a ship as the destination itself. The cruise ship was born. But the ocean liners, built for a voyage, weren't ideal for the purposes of a cruise, and over the next few decades, the cruise ship began its evolution. And it has culminated in the behemoths we see today.\n\n\nCruise ships always make me think of David Foster Wallace's classic piece, Shipping Out (which you might know as A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again).\nTags: travel · video",

Thus, all participants are wearing contemporary clothes with umbrellas substituted in for the 19th-century parasols. Though the team was organized, they weren't quite prepared for what mother nature threw their way the day of the shoot. Preuschl recalls winds of 20 to 25 mph coming off the river, as well as clouds that didn't allow for the shadows they were so desperately looking for. Luckily, there was a window of about 25 minutes when the sun came out and cast those shadows.\n\n\nHe really couldn't have scouted that location any better...it matches the original pretty well.

          "description": "Rebecca Solnit, writing for The Guardian on the climate crisis:\nMany things that were once true — that we didn't have adequate solutions, that the general public wasn't aware or engaged — no longer are. Outdated information is misinformation, and the climate situation has changed a lot in recent years. The physical condition of the planet — as this summer's unprecedented extreme heat and flooding and Canada's and Greece's colossal fires demonstrate — has continued to get worse; the solutions have continued to get better; the public is far more engaged; the climate movement has grown, though of course it needs to grow far more; and there have been some significant victories as well as the incremental change of a shifting energy landscape.\n\n\nI don't think of myself as a climate doomer, but I certainly feel less hopeful about the situation than Solnit does. She asserts that the main obstacles to meaningful action on the climate crisis in the West are politics and capitalism, which is supposed to make readers feel hopeful. But that's the part that often fills me with despair. The unpopular extremist party that controls more than half of the political apparatus in the country with the biggest responsibility to fix the planet is not only not interested in doing so, they are actively working against it. And they've built up such a wall against public accountability that I don't know if protest (which they will make illegal if they can) or even voting (which they've fought to make more difficult) are meaningful levers with which to try and change the situation.\nOk, maybe I am a climate doomer. But this piece by Solnit is good medicine for folks in despair about the climate. And I'm putting Not Too Late: Changing the Climate Story from Despair to Possibility (edited by Solnit and climate activist Thelma Young Lutunatabua) on my reading list as well.

          "description": "This is pretty cool: in collaboration with the British Museum, a team led by woodblock printmaker David Bull (who I first wrote about back in 20051) is carving woodblocks and creating prints from a series of previously unpublished drawings by legendary Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai.\nThe Museum has in their possession a group of drawings by Hokusai that were apparently intended for use in the production of a series of books. For reasons unknown to us now that project was cancelled, but the drawings survived, and we have selected 12 of them for a new subscription series.\nFor more details of the collection of images, please refer to this page of the British Museum website. But here, we can simply note that the drawings fall into a number of categories, and our set will reflect that diversity. Hokusai's series was intended to take his readers through aspects of Japanese historical culture, and we will meet Buddhist deities, warriors from ancient China, and historical landscapes, along with more prosaic scenes of the natural world.\n\n\nThe print shown above was the first one to be sent out in January. But look at this original drawing from the collection:\n\nWow. That is shockingly modern — like a 60s superhero comic or a still from 60s anime. I hope they reprint this one!\nHere's a video from the British Museum of Bull talking about the project:\n\nIf you make woodblock prints for a living, you know the name Hokusai, and if you're a woodblock carver and you hear about original drawings from Hokusai that have never been carved into prints you would most likely do a little happy dance.\n\n\n(via open culture)\n\nHooo boy, there are parts of that post that did not age well. Bull, however, is still doing his thing.↩\n\nTags: art · David Bull · Katsushika Hokusai · remix · video",

          "description": "In 1910, a group of inexperienced climbers claimed to have summited Denali, the highest peak in what is now the United States. Their story was greeted with skepticism.\nSo when I found out that the first people to reach the highest point in North America (Denali, the mountain formerly known as McKinley) were just a bunch of Average Joes with no climbing experience who went up on a bet, I was flabbergasted. How had I never heard this story? The more I looked into it, the more fantastic the story became. When these guys descended from the mountain, nobody believed they really even made it. And they wouldn't be the first people to fraudulently claim to have reached the top, with no evidence to offer that they succeeded. This story has all the makings of a blockbuster action comedy. It's almost unbelievable.\n\n\nBut later evidence suggests that they just might have made it to the top.\nTags: climbing · David Friedman · Denali · sports · video",

On the other hand, streaming has also changed how television gets produced, the role writers play, and how they get paid. We interviewed four television writers and showrunners about how streaming has changed how they work, how their incomes have taken a hit, and why it has become harder than ever to build a career.\n\n\n Tags: business · movies · TV · video",

But they weren't that speedy...maybe they could do 1-2 mph.\nAnyway, some kid at school figured out that you could remove the AA battery, connect wires to the battery terminals, and then connect those wires to as many C- and D-cell batteries as you could gang together in a series. So instead of the usual 1.5V, you could pump 4.5V, 6V, 7.5V, or even 9V into those tiny cars. And boy, did they go. We could barely keep up as we raced them against each other down the halls, running behind them holding our battery packs. But the thrills were short-lived — I think the school banned them and all that current burned the tiny Stomper motors out after awhile. Fun while it lasted though!

He retired from teaching this year and has uploaded his lectures from the course to YouTube. \nWelcome to my final UC Berkeley course on Wealth and Poverty. Drawing on my 40+ years in politics, including my time as secretary of labor, I offer a deeper look at why inequalities of income and wealth have widened significantly since the late 1970s in the United States, and why this poses dangerous risks to our society.\nThis course also offers insights into the political and public-policy debates that have arisen in light of this inequality, as well as possible means of reversing it.\n\n\nHere's the first lecture, What's Happened to Income & Wealth:\n\nReich has also published an abbreviated syllabus for each of the classes; links can be found in his course introduction (here's class #1).\nTags: economics · education · politics · Robert Reich · USA · video",

They are the first Latino hip-hop group to achieve platinum and multi-platinum status. B Real, Sen and producer DJ Muggs crafted a sound in the '90s that stretched beyond regional boundaries. It was dark, psychedelic and at times directly addressed mental health before the topic was commonplace. Many dismissed the group as \"stoner rappers,\" yet the members were fervent advocates for the legalization of weed long before it came to fruition.\n\n\nReally enjoyed this one...I'm not a particular fan of Cypress Hill but after this, maybe I am?\nTags: Cypress Hill · hip-hop · music · video",

          "description": "54 years ago today, on July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong & Buzz Aldrin landed on the Moon and went for a little walk. For the 15th year in a row, you can watch the original CBS News coverage of Walter Cronkite reporting on the Moon landing and the first Moon walk on a small B&W television, synced to the present-day time. Just open this page in your browser today, July 20th, and the coverage will start playing at the proper time. Here's the schedule (all times EDT):\n4:10:30 pm: Moon landing broadcast starts\n4:20:15 pm - 10:51:26 pm: Break in coverage\n10:51:27 pm: Moon walk broadcast starts\nSet an alarm on your phone or calendar! Also, this works best on an actual computer but I think it functions ok on phones and tablets if necessary.\nBack in 2018, I wrote a bit about what to look out for when you're watching the landing:\nThe radio voices you hear are mostly Mission Control in Houston (specifically Apollo astronaut Charlie Duke, who acted as the spacecraft communicator for this mission) and Buzz Aldrin, whose job during the landing was to keep an eye on the LM's altitude and speed — you can hear him calling it out, \"3 1/2 down, 220 feet, 13 forward.\" Armstrong doesn't say a whole lot...he's busy flying and furiously searching for a suitable landing site. But it's Armstrong that says after they land, \"Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.\". Note the change in call sign from \"Eagle\" to \"Tranquility Base\". :)\nTwo things to listen for on the broadcast: the 1201/1202 program alarms I mentioned above and two quick callouts by Charlie Duke about the remaining fuel towards the end: \"60 seconds\" and \"30 seconds\". Armstrong is taking all this information in through his earpiece — the 1202s, the altitude and speed from Aldrin, and the remaining fuel — and using it to figure out where to land.\n\n\n Tags: Apollo · Apollo 11 · Buzz Aldrin · Moon · Neil Armstrong · space · TV · Walter Cronkite",

I was expecting a straight-forward visual display accompanied by some relaxing music (and that version does exist) but it also includes a fascinating explanation of where all these colors and swirls come from.\nScientific investigations into beautiful phenomena always makes me think of physicist Richard Feynman's thoughts on beauty:\nI have a friend who is an artist, and has sometimes taken a view which I don't agree with very well. He'll hold up a flower and say \"Look how beautiful it is\" and I'll agree. And he says, \"you see, as an artist I can see how beautiful this is, but you as a scientist take this all apart and it becomes a dull thing.\" And I think that he's kind of nutty.\nFirst of all, the beauty that he sees is available to other people, and to me too, I believe - although I may not be quite as refined aesthetically as he is, but I can appreciate the beauty of a flower. At the same time, I see much more about the flower than he sees. I could imagine the cells in there, the complicated actions, which also have a beauty. I mean, it's not just beauty at this dimension of one centimeter, there's also beauty at smaller dimensions. The inner structure, also the processes, the fact that the colors and the flower are evolved in order to attract insects to pollinate it is interesting. It means that insects can see the color.\nIt adds a question: Is this aesthetic sense also exist in the lower forms that... why is it aesthetic... all kinds of interesting questions which the science, knowledge, only adds to the excitement, and mystery, and the awe of a flower. It only adds. I don't understand how it subtracts.\n\n\n(thx, everyone)\nTags: mesmerizing · science · video",

Call it 520 miles.  But no farther.\"\n\"Um... Email really doesn't work that way, generally,\" I said, trying to keep panic out of my voice.  One doesn't display panic when speaking to a department chairman, even of a relatively impoverished department like statistics.  \"What makes you think you can't send mail more than 500 miles?\"\n\"It's not what I *think*,\" the chairman replied testily.  \"You see, when we first noticed this happening, a few days ago—\"\n\"You waited a few DAYS?\" I interrupted, a tremor tinging my voice.  \"And you couldn't send email this whole time?\"\n\"We could send email.  Just not more than—\"\n\"—500 miles, yes,\" I finished for him, \"I got that.  But why didn't you call earlier?\"\n\"Well, we hadn't collected enough data to be sure of what was going on until just now.\"  Right.  This is the chairman of *statistics*. \"Anyway, I asked one of the geostatisticians to look into it—\"\n\"Geostatisticians...\"\n\"—yes, and she's produced a map showing the radius within which we can send email to be slightly more than 500 miles.  There are a number of destinations within that radius that we can't reach, either, or reach sporadically, but we can never email farther than this radius.\"\n\n\t\nHere's a FAQ that addresses some of the questions the more technically inclined among you may have about this story.\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n[This was originally posted on May  4, 2012.]\nTags:email",

When it comes to climate change, the brain's desire to resolve anxiety and distress often leads either to denial or fatalism: some people convince themselves that climate change is not a big deal, or that someone else will take care of it; others conclude that all is lost and there's nothing to be done. Davenport pushes her clients to aim for a middle ground of sustainable distress. We must, she says, become more comfortable in uncertainty, and remain present and active in the midst of fear and grief. Her clients usually struggle with this task in one of two ways, she said: they tend to be activists who can't acknowledge their feelings or people so aware of their feelings that they fail to act.\n\n\n Tags: climate crisis · Jia Tolentino · mental health",

          "description": "In this video from Architectural Digest, architect Michael Wyetzner runs us through why American diners look the way they do. Early diners took their cues from trains:\nSo let's take a look at a typical American diner. So the outside has a shape that's reminiscent of a train. In fact, that's how diners got their name. They're named after the dining car on a train.\nMany of the design elements in a diner are based on the necessities of dining on a train in a railroad car, like booth seating and counter seating, and an open kitchen.\nSo I like these two photos because they show all the elements that go into the classic American diner. On the exterior, you have that stainless steel smooth curvature, you've got that Art Deco typography. And then on the interior you have the checkered floor, you have the booths, you have the globes, and you have the jukebox.\nIn the early part of the 20th century, trains were the dominant form of travel. If you look at some of the earliest diners, they were in fact, actual train cars that were placed permanently on the ground.\n\n\nLater, cars and space travel provided inspiration in the diner's evolution.\nTags: architecture · food · Michael Wyetzner · video",

Women could visit as guests but only after 4pm and the club didn't admit its first woman as a member until Liza Minnelli in 1987.\nOne of the club's biggest traditions was its closed-door luncheon roasts of celebrities, which over the years included roasts of Humphrey Bogart, Johnny Carson, Milton Berle, Redd Foxx, and Bruce Willis.1 A few women were roasted before 1987 (Lucille Ball, Martha Raye, Barbra Streisand) but they were not allowed as guests. They even sent the waiters out of the room for the roasts.\nIn 1983, after months of planning, Phyllis Diller dressed up as a man (named Phillip Downey) and attended the roast of Sid Caesar (she's on the left in the photo above with her co-conspirator, Howard Rosen). Here are a pair of videos of Diller talking about her infiltration. To be fair, the Friar's Club didn't seem that mad at her because they roasted her just two years later.\n\nIn 2004, the club roasted Donald Trump (roastmaster was Regis Philbin) and the next year Trump served as roastmaster for Don King.

          "description": "There's a small moment in second-to-last episode of the season two of The Bear (extremely mild spoilers) that I liked even though you blink and you'll miss it. One of the new chefs is tentatively salting some steaks and Sydney says \"I need you to salt that like a sidewalk\". Cut to Carmy, who walks up muttering \"Where'd you grow up, Arizona?\", takes the salt, and absolutely just drenches the steaks in salt. And I was like, yeah, that's how you salt a steak!\nSeveral years ago, I started noticing in various cooking videos how much salt chefs put in & on food, particularly meat. I already knew that ample salting was important to the flavor, but I hadn't realized that I wasn't going far enough. I was being timid with my salting, afraid of oversalting and ruining dinner. Around this time, I read a Wired piece by chef David Chang about his Unified Theory of Deliciousness and I've been following his recommendation about salting food ever since:\nMy first breakthrough on this idea was with salt. It's the most basic ingredient, but it can also be hellishly complex. A chef can go crazy figuring out how much salt to add to a dish. But I believe there is an objectively correct amount of salt, and it is rooted in a counterintuitive idea. Normally we think of a balanced dish as being neither too salty nor undersalted. I think that's wrong. When a dish is perfectly seasoned, it will taste simultaneously like it has too much salt and too little salt. It is fully committed to being both at the same time.\n\n\nThis is the way. You'll screw it up sometimes and go overboard, but if you can consistently get right up to that edge, your food will taste the best it possibly can. This works particularly well with steaks and burgers...my burger went from \"pretty good\" to \"holy shit\" solely on the application of the proper amount of salt.\nTags: cooking · David Chang · food · The Bear · TV",

You got a problem with that?\" As you might expect, the piece makes interesting reading here in the actual future, particularly the sidebar of \"10 Scenario Spoilers\":\nThe long boom is a scenario, one possible future. It's built upon the convergence of many big forces and even more little pieces falling into place — all of them with a positive twist.

          "description": "Craig Mod recently finished a 16-day tour of jazz kissas in northern Japan. Jazz kissas are bar/cafes where one goes to listen to jazz, mostly on records and not live. Mod loosely defies them thusly:\nMostly defined as: Mid-20th century \"listening cafes\" for jazz music. But there is a lot of variance in this definition. Lots are coffee-focused cafes, fitting into the broader \"kissaten\" universe. But some are more bar-like, and some even jazz clubs (but for the most part, live music is rare). You can tie yourself in knots splitting hairs over this stuff. Though they're traditionally known as \"jazz kissa\" — the shortened version of \"kissaten\" (fear not: even if you call them \"jazz kissaten\" you won't suddenly turn into a pillar of salt). Some are seventy years old. Some forty. Some are five years old. The important defining element is simply: A presiding and effusive ever-abiding love for jazz, jazz, and more jazz.\n\n\nAt each stop, he recorded the ambient sounds of each kissa so that you can experience a little bit of the atmosphere at these places — here's the full playlist. The recordings were done with a pair of microphones so that the audio is in stereo. This sounds great with a good pair of headphones!\nTags: Craig Mod · Japan · music · travel · video",

          "description": "In a piece from January, Cory Doctorow outlined the enshittification lifecycle of online platforms:\nHere is how platforms die: First, they are good to their users; then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers; finally, they abuse those business customers to claw back all the value for themselves. Then, they die.\n...\nThis is enshittification: Surpluses are first directed to users; then, once they're locked in, surpluses go to suppliers; then once they're locked in, the surplus is handed to shareholders and the platform becomes a useless pile of shit. From mobile app stores to Steam, from Facebook to Twitter, this is the enshittification lifecycle.\n\n\nTaking note of various platforms lighting themselves on fire recently, Mike Masnick offers a list of rules for the leadership of these platforms to follow to avoid turning into dumpster fires. Here's rule #3:\nCreate more value than you capture. This one is not mine, but Tim O'Reilly's, and it's one that constantly sticks with me. As you're developing a business model, the best way to make sure that you're serving your users best, and not enshittifying everything, is to constantly make sure that you're only capturing some of the value you're creating, and are instead putting much more out into the world, especially for your community. Your investors will push you to capture more and more of that value, but again, when you start chasing that, you're also spiraling down the enshittification curve.\n\n\nIMO, some of what is going on with Twitter & Reddit is not enshittification per se, but more of a pushback against the power of their users. (I always think of Tron in instances like these. \"I fight for the users!\") I think these CEOs know on some level that they're making their product worse, but bringing their user bases to heel is worth the short-term headaches.\nTags: business · Cory Doctorow · lists · Mike Masnick · Reddit · Twitter",

(from Wikipedia):\nThe novel is set against the backdrop of a dystopian United States that has come under the grip of a Christian fundamentalist denomination called \"Christian America\" led by President Andrew Steele Jarret. Seeking to restore American power and prestige, and using the slogan \"Make America Great Again\", Jarret embarks on a crusade to cleanse America of non-Christian faiths. Slavery has resurfaced with advanced \"shock collars\" being used to control slaves. Virtual reality headsets known as \"Dreamasks\" are also popular since they enable wearers to escape their harsh reality.\n\n\nWell, our present reality certainly checks a remarkable number of those boxes, including an absolute bullseye on \"Make America Great Again\".\nTags: books · Donald Trump · Octavia Butler · Parable of the Sower · Parable of the Talents · politics · USA",

Hidari is a stop-motion animation of an inventive fight sequence between a lone warrior/craftsman and a boss & his minions. The vibe of the animation is at once halting and buttery smooth, a combination that's wonderfully expressive. Directed by Masashi Kawamura, the plan is to turn this into a feature-length film:\nThis is a pilot version of the stop-motion samurai film that tells the story of \"Jingoro Hidari,\" a legendary Edo-era craftsman. All the characters are made by wood and animated frame by frame, just like how Jingoro's wooden sculptures came to life in his many anecdotes. We hope you enjoy this film, which mixes dynamic actions as seen in Japanimation, and the rich analog expressions of stop-motion animation.\nOur intention is to use this pilot film as a starting point to create a full length feature film. We have started activities to raise the necessary partners and funding to achieve this goal.\n\n\nTake my money! (P.S. Turn on subtitles if you don't speak Japanese. Oh, and here's a behind-the-scenes look at how they did the animation.)\nTags: Masashi Kawamura · stop motion · video",

Some parts of the garden are possible to develop by local seniors. The platform connects the diverse program, intensifies the use of the place and becomes itself an element of play.

While conservatives on the Supreme Court delivered the fatal blow, the policy has long been made vulnerable by the soft bigotry of parents, whose commitment to integration and equality turns cold the moment their little cherubs fail to get into their first choice of college or university. If you want to see a white liberal drop the pretense that they care about systemic racism and injustice, just tell them that their privately tutored kid didn't get into whatever \"elite\" school they were hoping for. If you want to make an immigrant family adopt a Klansman's view of the intelligence, culture, and work ethic of Black folks, tell them that their kid's standardized test scores are not enough to guarantee entry into ivy-draped halls of power. Some of the most horribly racist claptrap folks have felt comfortable saying to my face has been said in the context of people telling me why they don't like affirmative action, or why my credentials are somehow \"unearned\" because they were \"given\" to me by affirmative action.\nThat last bit is in some ways the most devastating: Black people are attacked and shamed simply because the policy exists, regardless of whether it benefited them or not. I've had white folks whom I could standardize-test into a goddamn coma tell me that I got into school only because of affirmative action. I once talked to a white guy — whose parents' name was on one of the buildings on campus — who asked me how it felt to know I got \"extra help\" to get in. The sheer nerve of white folks is sometimes jaw-dropping.\n\n\nI recommended this yesterday in a Quick Link, but Scene On Radio's episode of their Seeing White series on White Affirmative Action is great.\nTags: Elie Mystal · politics · racism · Supreme Court · USA",

These aren't necessarily the best restaurants on Earth, but places that have \"withstood the test of time, eschewing trendy gimmicks in favor of traditional, high-quality cuisine\".\nHere are a few of the entries from the list that I've either been to or would like to go to someday (ok, almost the whole list would have qualified for that):\n2. Katz's Delicatessen (pastrami on rye)\nSchwartz's is iconic, but I think Snowdon Deli has better smoked meat. In the same vein, I've had good steak and not-so-good steak at Luger's — as far as an iconic NYC steakhouse goes, I would have gone for Keen's.\nI'm sure any food fan worth their (don't say it, don't say it) salt (ugh) could come up with a few dozen restaurants that could/should be on this list, but 150 is certainly a good start! Soba, bratwurst, ćevapi, udon, churrasco, kofte, phở, ramen, ceviche, sushi, risotto, bouillabaisse, dim sum, BBQ, Peking duck, biryani, xiao long bao...man, I'm so hungry now!\nTags: best of · food · lists · restaurants",

          "description": "From Rabbi Danya Ruttenberg, a piece on the still-radical teachings of Fred Rogers, who emphasized the \"love thy neighbor\" part of the Bible rather than the twisted \"persecute the other\" version that has taken hold in so-called Christian communities in America over the past few decades.\nFred Rogers was a Presbyterian minister whose life's work was, I believe, built almost entirely (if not entirely) around Leviticus 19:18: \"Love your neighbor as yourself: I am God.\" Hence... the neighborhood. In practice it that looked like this (all of these are his words): \"To love someone is to strive to accept that person exactly the way [they are], right here and now.\" and \"Everyone longs to be loved. And the greatest thing we can do is to let people know that they are loved and capable of loving.\"\n\n\nPart of his philosophy was acknowledging that, because we loved them, we needed to have truthful, difficult conversations with our children. \nWhen Bobby Kennedy was murdered that same year, he did something that's pretty much impossible to our world today.\nHe had a puppet tiger ask an actor:\n\"What does 'assassination' mean?\"\nHe knew that small children would be hearing this word, and that they would be aware that something major had happened. And that most of the time, when adults are preoccupied with communal tragedy and trauma, children get left out-to their own detriment.\nBetter they should know, in an age-appropriate way, and be given the tools to cope, than to be left out in the cold, as he put it, \"at the mercy of their own imaginations.\"\nAgain, naming true things and simply holding space to let children deal with them — rather than trying to hide or minimize or gaslight because it seems too hard.\nThat's love.\n\n\n(via @CultureDesk)\nTags: Danya Ruttenberg · Fred Rogers · religion · TV",

I was pleased to see Broad Band: The Untold Story of the Women Who Made the Internet by Claire Evans and Small Fry by Lisa Brennan-Jobs on there, as well as Close to the Machine: Technophilia and Its Discontents by Ellen Ullman and Neil Postman's Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology. I'm baffled that Tracy Kidder's amazing The Soul of a New Machine didn't make the top 5 or even 10.\nBut reading through the rest of the list, it occurred to me that I don't really read tech books — and if I did, I didn't get a whole lot from them. When I was younger and trying to understand the industry and momentous period I was participating in, I generally looked to books outside of tech as guides. I read things like How Buildings Learn by Steward Brand, The Death and Life of Great American Cities by Jane Jacobs, Chaos by James Gleick, The Timeless Way of Building by Christopher Alexander, and Understanding Comics by Scott McCloud.\nAnyway, back to the list — it seems incomplete in a way that I can't quite articulate. I would have liked to have seen Tom Standage's The Victorian Internet on there. What else? I would like to hear about your favorite books about tech (or non-tech books that are sneakily about tech anyway) or what you think might be missing from the list.

The march, called the Christopher Street Liberation Day Parade, was held on June 28 to commemorate the first anniversary of the Stonewall Uprising. From Gothamist:\nThe Christopher Street Gay Liberation Day March started in Greenwich Village at about 2 p.m. that day in 1970, just outside the Stonewall Inn, which was then for rent, having closed the previous October.\nAs they gathered, the marchers were few, and brave. There were groups from Washington, DC and Boston, college organizations from Rutgers, Yale and Columbia. Some transgender people who were there at the time said that organizers asked them to march in the back, but they refused.\n\"The trans community said, 'Hell no, we won't go.' We fought for this as much as you did, or even started it,\" said Victoria Cruz. \"And we just mingled throughout the crowd. There was no trans contingent. We just mingled.\"\nThey started walking very briskly up Christopher Street, because they were scared. There had been bomb threats. People worried they would be shot at, or harassed again by the police. Martin Boyce was there, and he says that afterwards they joked it was \"the first run.\"\n\"I was worried about being single file, because I just watched a program on National Geographic about wildebeests and I saw how the ones on the side were picked off. So I thought I would stay in the middle — but there was no middle.\"\n\n\nAs the march went on, it gathered people & momentum and they eventually made it without major incident to Central Park.\nTags: LGBTQ · NYC · video",

In this video we spoke to Simon Weisse, prop maker and model marker for some of Wes Anderson's recent projects, like The Grand Budapest Hotel, The French Dispatch, and Asteroid City.\nOlder movies, like 1977's Star Wars: Episode IV — A New Hope, had no choice but to use miniatures to make their worlds feel real. But even in the modern day of CGI, filmmakers are still using minis — just look at projects like The Mandalorian, Blade Runner 2049, Harry Potter, and The Dark Knight series. In those movies, miniatures are used for expansive sets that establish the world of a film, otherworldly vehicles like spaceships, and more.\n\n\nIt's perfect for Anderson's storybook aesthetic, of course...it looks great in Asteroid City (which I really enjoyed overall).\nTags: film school · movies · video · Wes Anderson",
