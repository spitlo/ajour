Rewriting systems are a computation paradigm that is generally unknown and under-explored that might have some fascinating features that might be able help us to tackle some of our future projects.\nIn other news, Pino is ready to head northward! We finished all of our boats projects and left the dock on May 1st. See a photo of our first day of the year on the water, taken as we exited Enterprise Channel, just north of Trial Island south of Victoria. On our travels we will continue to push updates every month like usual, but the updates will only go live when we find internet, and this may or may not coincide with the start of every month. We will keep a log of our travels, populated with plenty of drawings!\nPino book & movie club\nBook Club: This month we are reading The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand.\nContinue Reading",

We removed the original ones earlier this month to inspect them and found some pit corrosion(as well as a small crack), replacing them was necessary. With the chainplates gone, we removed the entire starboard side cabinet to see what was behind it—it's always nice to see parts of our boat we've never seen. We also replaced 3 old halyards on Pino. Devine earned themself a couple of blisters splicing dyneema onto some of our existing halyards.\nSejo revisited the Uxn tutorial, and appended corrections. The most important change is that the tutorial is now targeting the learn-uxn platform(online) maintained by metasyn. Now, people can jump right in and experiment without having to set up a dev environment. Tsoding, someone who can code in front of the camera in a language they've never used or read the docs for, did a pretty funny session in Uxntal, you can watch it here.\nThere has been too many exciting Uxn projects coming out these past few days, so we'll just put a link to the hashtag. Someone also created a Discord channel, it's a good place to learn about other concatenative languages and an alternative for people who have trouble with #uxn, in irc.libera.chat.\nPino book & movie club\nThis month we are reading The Last Great Sea by Terry Glavin, and we watched the movie Tenet.\nContinue Reading",

          "description": "Cutting to the chase: text editors *and* tabs vs. spaces!  Ooooh!\n\n\nI've had this thing called \"e\" for a while now.  It's a stupid little \nscript which serves to do a couple of things.  It starts my \neditor\nwith a given file, and it kicks it with the right arguments to make it \ndisable line wrapping and to make the [TAB] key actually put in two \nspaces.\n\n\nSo, my dumb script would use \"-w -E -T 2\" most of the time, except when it \nwas running on a Makefile, at which point it would skip those args.  \nSimple enough, right?\n\n\npico is back?  Yes indeed, on Macs, as of 12.3, pico is in fact back.  To \nmake sure I wasn't imagining things, I tracked down a machine that hadn't \nbeen upgraded yet and checked there.  Sure enough, it was in fact nano and \nnot pico.\n\n\nmacOS 12.3 has nano as a symlink... pointing to pico!\n\n\nAt some point, I switched from literal tab characters in my source code to \nblobs of spaces, probably due to using that style at work and not hating \nit.  So, somewhere along the line I actually started depending on nano \nbehavior without realizing it.\n\n\nAs for the lack of a feature in pico itself, it's kind of strange, really.  \nIf you go digging into the source, they have this random.c with a function \ncalled tab which claims to \"simulate tab stop\" using spaces.  That said, I \ncan't find any place where it would be called with the magic values which \nwould make it behave that way.\n\n\nIt wouldn't surprise me if this switch is just more of Apple removing \nGPLed things from their OS - pico seems to use the Apache license.  They \ndumped bash for zsh (MIT license) at some point (Big Sur, I think), and \nnow this?  Okay then.",

          "description": "Here's a very old and stupid trick you could do with some filesystems in \nsome situations back in the day... and might still be able to do in a \nfew places today.\n\n\nThe problem is that while version X might eventually have an exploit, \nit'll get removed and it'll be replaced by version Y without that\nparticular hole.  By the time you get your hands on a tool to break into \nX, it'll be gone.\n\n\nWhat you'd do is create a hard link pointing at the file you wanted to \npreserve, storing it in a spot which was writable by your account.  \nThen, say, /usr/bin/sudo (because that never has security \nissues...) gets replaced at some point with a new file and you get to \nkeep the old version.  When you get the tool to pop it, off you go!\n\n\nOf course, these days, it's not quite so easy on the more modern systems \nyou find.  Debian 11 here won't let me do it - it's EPERM city.  Rocky 8 \n(so CentOS 8 and RHEL 8 too) also won't do it.  They both have some gunk\nin /usr/lib/sysctl.d to lock this down.  But, my old Slackware 14.2 \ninstall of my workstation let me do it the last time I tried about \na year ago.  How about that, huh?  I bet it'd still work if I dug out \nthe old drives and booted them up.\n\n\nIncidentally, this is the magic sauce: /proc/sys/fs/protected_hardlinks\nRead the man page for proc(5) to learn more about it.\n\nhere it is,\nthe thread I read a long time ago.  It's interesting to note that as far \nas I can tell, nothing actually changed upstream.  This left paranoid \nadmins like me with no option but to use the (most excellent) Openwall \npatches to lock down this kind of stuff.  I used that on my machines at \nwork which had non-staff users... just in case.\n\n\nThis whole situation is scary.  \nRead more about it.",

I \ncould just pick an interesting-sounding metric and then would just ask \nthe system to show me the top 10 or bottom 10 out of a population of \nthousands or more.\n\n\nTo get my feet wet with the whole \"investigations\" thing that we'd do, I \nstarted looking into this one day and chose one of the many temp sensors \nwhich were being logged by the servers.  I forget exactly which one it \nwas, for there were many.  The CPUs logged it, the chassis logged it, \nthe power supply logged it, and so on.  There were so many choices.\n\n\nI went looking for a reason.  What could possibly explain this?  First \noff, it didn't line up with any obvious pattern in the host names.  The \nhosts were named for whichever team owned them, followed by a sequence \nnumber that was bumped any time a new one was provisioned.  There was no \nsignal to be found in that.\n\n\nThere was more, though.  You could also see a \"rack position\" in this \ndata, and now it started getting interesting.  It seems that all of the \nreally hot machines had a rack position of something low, like 04 or 05, \nand never anything higher than that.  In fact, when looking at a whole \nrack, it was always the lowest number of all of the positions that were \nbeing used.  Now this was worth chasing!\n\n\nIt's good that I asked, since they told me something surprising: \nposition 04 or 05 or whatever was the *bottom* of the rack.  Yes, \nsomehow, the lowest machine in the rack was the hottest!  They found \nthis interesting, too, and wound up digging into it.  Given that I was \nfar away in a distant office, this was the best way for us to proceed.\n\n\nThe problem was that the bottommost server would have nothing below it \nbut just open space until it got to the floor.  That space would not \nmove air efficiently, and it obviously mattered.\n\n\nThis rolled out and my hot spots disappeared.  Fantastic!",

In short, it looks like every Raspberry Pi filesystem installed \nfrom any given release image probably ends up with the same\nUUID.\n\n\nFor instance, if you downloaded the \"lite\" version of Raspbian between \nroughly November 8th and January 28th, you probably got a file called \n2021-10-30-raspios-bullseye-armhf-lite.zip.  Inside, there's an image, \nand the idea is that you dump that straight to your SD card, cram it in \nthe Pi, and off you go.  The second partition on that image is an ext4 \nfilesystem which was created on some build machine somewhere.  The UUID \non it never gets \"evolved\" to something else after the install.\n\n\nYou can see it inside the image itself here:\n\n\nOr, if you actually installed a few of these things like I did over the \npast couple of months, you can just 'tune2fs -l /dev/mmcblk0p2' and see \nthe same value in there.\n\n\nDon't end up with a pile of SD cards on your desk and think \"I know, \nI'll use the filesystem UUIDs to track which one goes where\", in other \nwords.\n\n\nIf it's not breaking anything for you, it's probably best to just let it \nbe.  Untangling a boot mess on these weird little boxes is anything but \nfun.\n\nNote: if you're actually on a recent Raspberry Pi, odds are good that \nyour /etc/fstab will be using *partition* UUIDs (PARTUUID=...) and not \nthose of the filesystem.

This is back in the pre-systemd days \nof running services, such that things tended to be started or restarted \nby someone or something that itself ran as root.  That is, if you \nstarted something, it might inherit one or more things from your \nenvironment.  Likewise, if you ran something with an unusual \nenvironment, it might bestow those \"gifts\" onto anything it happened to \ntouch.\n\n\nAfter locking themselves out of machines too many times, people \ngenerally learned that after you mess with a glibc upgrade, you restart \nthe sshd listener on port 22.  Of course, they also had to learn to not \nwhack EVERY sshd at the…",

I wanted to present it \nin a post all by itself to give it a chance to \"sink in\" before I went \nand used it in an analogy.  First, I'll just show the image and explain \nwhat you're looking at here.\n\n\n\n\nI do remember the description from the back: this is a picture of *part \nof* something that was called the Software Creations BBS.  It was a \nmulti-line bulletin board system where you could dial up and send \nmessages to people, upload and download files, and (presumably) play \nonline games (\"doors\") and anything else they cared to offer.\n\n64 machines in a little space.

I think the sheer amount of “Wheels on the Bus” and “Row, Row, Row Your Boat” did the trick: I enjoy it more now and feel like I’m hitting more of the right notes. I’m still not “good,” but I’m not bad, and I’m less embarrassed to be caught singing in front of other people. It reminds me of the Terry Gross detail that she took voice lessons not to become a better singer but simply so she could sing along more pleasurably to music she loved. \nHas anyone else been singing anything fun lately?

As long as I exercised, my body wouldn’t slip back into its old state. I’d be safe.\n\n\nAnd last week, Rod Gilchrist wrote I Was a Running Addict for The Guardian: \nThe trouble is, once you’ve got the running bug, it’s hard to scale back, even when your body demands it.\n \n\nAnd a few days after that, The Guardian also ran I Thought Fitness Was My Superpower. Then I Realized It Was a Ball and Chain, by Sam Pyrah: \nI tried to push through it – until, suddenly, neither my body nor my brain could find a reason to carry on. I slowed to a walk. I stopped my watch. I sat down and had a little cry, the sweat drying on my back. Then I walked home.\n\n\nThe essays remind me of a concept called Positive Addiction (and a 1985 book of the same name) — the idea that it’s possible to be truly addicted to things that are good for you. I’m an almost-daily runner, and I do understand how it could be described as addiction, although for now I just love it. Maybe a key is that I don’t run especially long distances. And it’s a relatively new habit. But I guess there’s (hopefully) still plenty of time for it to sour. \nTags: exercise · health · personal essays · running\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

          "description": "I am apparently one of the few people who really liked the first season of the Lord of the Rings prequel series, The Rings of Power. I mean, it had its rough spots and maybe there was a little too much table-setting, but in general it left me wanting to see what was going to happen next. The trailer for season two just dropped and it looks pretty action-packed and stocked with characters & events that would be familiar to those who have read the main book series. Here’s the synopsis:\nSauron has returned. Cast out by Galadriel, without army or ally, the rising Dark Lord must now rely on his own cunning to rebuild his strength and oversee the creation of the Rings of Power, which will allow him to bind all the peoples of Middle-earth to his sinister will. Building on Season One’s epic scope and ambition, the new season plunges even its most beloved and vulnerable characters into a rising tide of darkness, challenging each to find their place in a world that is increasingly on the brink of calamity. Elves and dwarves, orcs and men, wizards and Harfoots… as friendships are strained and kingdoms begin to fracture, the forces of good will struggle ever more valiantly to hold on to what matters to them most of all… each other.\n\n\nAnd they also released a behind-the-scenes look at the production of season two:\n\nThe second season of The Rings of Power premieres on August 29 on Amazon Prime.\nTags: The Lord of the Rings · The Rings of Power · trailers · TV · video\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

For a youth-hockey kid, playing spring league is the equivalent of a minor-league pitcher playing winter ball in Mexico — so necessary as a statement of intent and means of improvement that forgoing it is like giving up “the path.” Rather than a simple affirmative nod, as I’d expected, I got these words: “I’m going to think about it.” Think about it?

Well, it kicks off today. To participate, all you need to do is follow the reading schedule. If you don’t have a copy of the book yet, check out this free ebook version by Standard Ebooks — they even have a web version you can read on your phone or tablet (or Vision Pro, I guess?). \nIf you’d also like to discuss the book (and/or follow along with others discussing the book), there’s this feed on Bluesky. I found this little tidbit on the feed:\nFrankenstein takes place in the mid-1790s and Moby Dick may take place as early as 1830, so it’s possible Captain Walton sailed with a young Ahab.\n\n\nSomeone needs to write that little crossover prequel.\nAnyway, you can also use this comment thread as a place to discuss the book. I’m not sure how well it will work, but we can give it a try? I’d suggest not discussing anything ahead of the day’s reading, but other than that, let ‘er rip!\nTags: books · Frankenstein · Mary Shelley\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

Over the past 60 years, it has passed every great moral test American foreign policy has forced upon the public, including the Vietnam war, the question of relations with apartheid South Africa, and the Iraq war. Student activists were at the heart of the black civil rights movement from the very beginning. To much derision and abuse, they pushed for more rights, protections and respect for women and queer people on their campuses than the wider world was long willing to provide. And over the past 20 years in particular, policymakers have arrived belatedly to stances on economic inequality, climate change, drug policy and criminal justice that putative radicals on campus took up long before them.\nThey have not always been right; even when right, their prescriptions for the problems they’ve identified and their means of directing attention to them have not always been prudent. But time and time and time again, the student left in America has squarely faced and expressed truths our politicians and all the eminent and eloquent voices of moderation in the press, in all of their supposed wisdom and good sense, have been unable or unwilling to see. Straining against an ancient and immortal prejudice against youth, it has made a habit of telling the American people, in tones that discomfit, what they need to hear before they are ready to hear it.\n\n\n(via @anildash.com)\nTags: Osita Nwanevu · politics",

The great Erik Larson (The Devil in the White City, The Splendid and the Vile, In the Garden of Beasts) came out with a new book two weeks ago and I somehow missed it! I almost shrieked when I saw it on the bookstore front table yesterday.\nAnyway, the book is called The Demon of Unrest: A Saga of Hubris, Heartbreak, and Heroism at the Dawn of the Civil War (bookshop.org). Here’s the synopsis:\nOn November 6, 1860, Abraham Lincoln became the fluky victor in a tight race for president. The country was bitterly at odds; Southern extremists were moving ever closer to destroying the Union, with one state after another seceding and Lincoln powerless to stop them. Slavery fueled the conflict, but somehow the passions of North and South…",

          "description": "Using the Barbie movie and other media (movies, TV shows) as a guide, Pop Culture Detective delves into what “patriarchy” actually means (mirrors: Patreon & archive.org).\nWe’re going to use the movie as a sort of primer to help explain what patriarchy actually is, what it isn’t, and how it ends up harming everyone, including men. To have any kind of productive conversation, we have to get over that defensiveness that so many men feel whenever they they come across the word “patriarchy”. Contrary to popular belief, patriarchy is not a synonym for men, nor is it a code word for masculinity, and it certainly has nothing to do with hating men.\n\n\nThe bibliography in the description of the video lists three books if you’d like to do some reading on the topic:\nThe Gender Knot: Unraveling Our Patriarchal Legacy by Allan G Johnson.\nThe Will to Change: Men, Masculinity, and Love by bell hooks.\nMasculinities by R. W. Connell.\n\n\n(via waxy)\nP.S. While I was watching this video, YouTube removed it after Warner Brothers “blocked it on copyright grounds”. The channel is challenging the takedown and has uploaded it to Patreon and archive.org in the meantime. (I’m leaving the embed in case it comes back to life.) This bullshit is so irritating — Google just totally letting massive media corporations decide what’s copyright infringing without recourse. And Warner (and Gerwig & Robbie too to some lesser extent)…you made the fucking movie to get a message across and to get people talking and someone posts a thoughtful video essay about the central issue of the film and you fucking take it down?\nTags: Barbie · feminism · movies · video",

          "description": "NASA used one of their supercomputers to model what it would look like if you flew into a supermassive black hole. (You can watch the simulation in a 360° view on YouTube. I bet it looks great on a VR rig like Apple Vision Pro.)\nThe movies begin with the camera located nearly 400 million miles (640 million kilometers) away, with the black hole quickly filling the view. Along the way, the black hole’s disk, photon rings, and the night sky become increasingly distorted — and even form multiple images as their light traverses the increasingly warped space-time.\nIn real time, the camera takes about 3 hours to fall to the event horizon, executing almost two complete 30-minute orbits along the way. But to anyone observing from afar, it would never quite get there. As space-time becomes ever more distorted closer to the horizon, the image of the camera would slow and then seem to freeze just shy of it. This is why astronomers originally referred to black holes as “frozen stars.”\nAt the event horizon, even space-time itself flows inward at the speed of light, the cosmic speed limit. Once inside it, both the camera and the space-time in which it’s moving rush toward the black hole’s center — a one-dimensional point called a singularity, where the laws of physics as we know them cease to operate.\n“Once the camera crosses the horizon, its destruction by spaghettification is just 12.8 seconds away,” Schnittman said. From there, it’s only 79,500 miles (128,000 kilometers) to the singularity. This final leg of the voyage is over in the blink of an eye.\n\n\nBlack holes: so cool.

          "description": "If you play carefully by not stomping enemies, not collecting coins, not eating mushrooms or flowers, and hopping on the flagpole at the very last second, you can rescue the princess in Super Mario Bros with only 500 points.\n\nOne bit is surprisingly tricky:\nHow tough is that jump in 8-1? Well, the timing of the liftoff, the duration of holding the jump button, and the timing of the wall jump are all frame perfect. NES games run at 60 frames per second, which means all the necessary inputs need to be timed within 1/60 of a second. In addition, the starting position before running I used not only has to be on the right pixel, but also the x sub-pixel has to fall within a certain range (technical stuff blah blah blah). In short, it’s a pretty annoying jump.\n\n\nWhen I was a kid, I left my NES on for three straight days to flip the score in SMB, using the 1UP trick and another spot in the game to get many lives and points. Scoring lower would have been a lot quicker.\n[This is a vintage post originally from Feb 2014.]\nTags: Super Mario Bros · timeless posts · video · video games",

          "description": "The Greatest Life Hacks in the World (For Now).” It was mostly a tribute to Kevin Kelly’s famous life advice posts, but Brooks added one of his own, and  I’ve thought of at least once a week since: \n…over the last few years I have embraced, almost as a religious mantra, the idea that if you’re not sure you can carry it all, take two trips.\n\n\nTake two trips. Nothing serious, but of all the “life advice” posts I’ve read, this is the one that’s changed my own life the most. Anyone else have something from an advice list that really made it into their brains/lives?\nThe closest thing to a life advice aphorism I’ve ever come up with is maybe too gross to write down. And it’s running-themed, so it could be too specific. But maybe if I share it here, I will exorcise it from my brain: Sometimes you’re so worried about pooping your pants that you don’t realize you’ve already pooped your pants. \nTags: advice · David Brooks · Kevin Kelly · take two trips\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

In the latest issue of his Roden newsletter, he explains why he likes it so much:\nOnce you hold a Palma, you realize that for most situations it’s an ideal reading container. On the train? In line? In the waiting room at the doctor’s office? I’ve carried my Palma with me every day for the past three or so months with the goal of reaching for it rather than my iPhone. I call it the Gentle Librarian. Soft screen, clean interface, no SIM card and so mostly no internet (it loads up with new articles while at home on Wi-Fi; I can always tether to my phone to update or add something new to read on the go), a refresh rate that is plausible enough on which to watch movies (!! hypnotizing, actually, like watching a magic trick, like what Victorians may have imagined “computer screens” to look like) but not really responsive enough to seduce you into installing social media apps. There’s a lot of friction in this little bugger, and it turns out a bit of friction is a good friend of the kind of reading we love.\n\n\nHmm. Hmm! Like Mod, I’m frustrated with Amazon’s lack of vision and activity on the ereader front and lament the time I spend on my Casino Rectangle / Dingdong Casino of Hell. Maybe I’ll try the Palma out…\nTags: Amazon · books · BOOX · Craig Mod · Kindle\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

To survive and thrive while rooted in a single spot, plants have adapted ingenious methods of survival. In recent years, scientists have learned about their ability to communicate, recognize their kin and behave socially, hear sounds, morph their bodies to blend into their surroundings, store useful memories that inform their life cycle, and trick animals into behaving to their benefit, to name just a few remarkable talents.\n\n\nI heard about it from NPR’s Fresh Air — check out this completely metal behavior:\nSchlanger notes that some tomato plants, when being eaten by caterpillars, fill their leaves with a chemical that makes them so unappetizing that the caterpillars start eating each other instead. Corn plants have been known to sample the saliva of predator caterpillars — and then use that information to emit a chemical to attract a parasitic wasp that will attack the caterpillar.\nSchlanger acknowledges that our understanding of plants is still developing — as are the definitions of “intelligence” and “consciousness.” “Science is there [for] observation and to experiment, but it can’t answer questions about this ineffable, squishy concept of intelligence and consciousness,” she says.\n\n\n        \n\n         \nTags: books · plants · The Light Eaters · Zoe Schlanger\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

          "description": "Do you remember the Broccoli Tree? Photographer Patrik Svedberg photographed a Swedish tree that resembled a broccoli floret over a number of years, posted the results to Instagram, and made the tree internet famous. Then some asshole vandal sawed through the branches of the tree and it had to be chopped down. John Green eulogized the Broccoli Tree in a video:\nTo share something is to risk losing it, especially in a world where sharing occurs at tremendous scale and where everyone seems to want to be noticed, even if only for cutting down a beloved tree.\n\n\nWell, the stump of the tree was left in the hopes that it would grow again and I’m pleased to say that it has — here’s a photo from three years ago:\n\nYou can even see it on Google Maps. I’m glad the tree is growing again but wish the destruction hadn’t happened in the first place.\nTags: Patrik Svedberg · photography · trees\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

I definitely learned and remembered more about Thomas Cromwell-era England from Dissolution than I did from any textbooks (not that I’ve read any of those in a while, but still). It was all very visceral in a damp-stone-monastery, heavy cloaks, burning candles, teeth-being-pulled-in-the-Tower-of-London kind of way. Also his novels are just super fun, and the Matthew Shardlake character — a sort of proto-detective lawyer — is especially memorable. \nTags: books · C.J.

This situation has now met with a live-streamed genocide which is supported, and brazenly lied about, by political leaders and commentators who claim to stand for truth and justice. Students, like much of the public, cannot square the reality of what they see with the world as constructed by politicians and the media.\nUnder such circumstances, pitching tents, raising placards and demanding divestment are really quite mild-mannered responses. That they have been met, in many US universities, with militarised policing reflects the fragility of liberalism — in the face of the growing hegemony of the conservative right as well as its own inability to offer a future even to Ivy League college students, let alone the less privileged.\n\n\n        \n\n         \nTags: education · Gareth Fearn · policing · politics · USA",

The NY Times wrote about the effort to preserve his legacy.\nJen Bekman, the founder of the online gallery 20x200, reflected on Mr. Polan’s legacy while she sat beside his sketches.\n“These are not doodles,” Ms. Bekman said. “That word is diminishing. People remember him as an illustrator, but Jason was a great artist, and his practice was his life.”\n\n\nI “lost” a bunch of time browsing through the collection this morning, which includes both work by Polan and things he collected & received from other artists.\n\n\n\n\nIt’s great to see Polan’s legacy being preserved and his art being spread around the world. And to be reminded of that time he went to a fashion show.\nI sort of stood still because I was a little confused as to what just happened. Kim walked right by me. Puff Daddy took a picture with someone right in front of me. I then saw Beyoncé walking toward me and I said, “Hi Beyoncé,” and she said, “Heeey,” and smiled and it was kind of like having a Bar Mitzvah. Then Jay Z walked by and I said, “Hi Jay,” and in the second I said that I thought, am I supposed to add a Z? but didn’t and he said hey but not as beautifully as Beyoncé. I love her so much. I drew a couple more people and then went outside and forgot where I was and then walked to the train and went home.\n\n\nReminder: you can buy prints and things of Polan’s work at 20x200. I have several of these, including the Zoo Baggu, which I get compliments on almost every time I use it for grocery shopping.\nTags: art · Jason Polan\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

The price per pound ratio doesn’t appeal to me as much, but when I get those big bags from Costco, I don’t know, something about the endlessness of it. It really, really drives me.\nGracie’s: You get lost in the bottom of bag.\nJack Van Cleaf: I do, I do.

Apparently, he mistook his gun for a flashlight. You may be wondering: how could this happen? Well, like this. From a 2014 article in the Denver Post:\n\nRonny Flanagan took pride in his record as a police officer in Plano, Texas. He had an incident-free career. He took safety training regularly. He was known at the range as a very good shot.\nYet he killed a man when he was simply trying to press a flashlight switch mounted beneath the trigger on his pistol.\nIn a deposition, Flanagan expressed his remorse and made a prediction.\n“I don’t want anyone to ever sit in a chair I’m in right now,” he said. “Think about the officers that aren’t as well trained, officers tha…",

They are not great at new ideas.\nAnd I think that the power of human beings sort of having new ideas all the time, that’s the thing that the platforms won’t be able to find. That’s why the platforms feel old. Social platforms like enter a decay state where everyone’s making the same thing all the time.

          "description": "Nothing more exciting than knitted items! This isn’t news, but a relative sent it to me recently, and I see it also made the rounds on Reddit a few days ago. Here’s the gist, per the Rijksmuseum:\nIn 1980 archaeologists investigated the graves of 185 Dutchmen — whale hunters, and workers at whale oil refineries — who had died on or near Spitsbergen [an island in Norway’s Svalbard archipelago] in the 17th century. Many skeletons were still wearing their knitted woollen head coverings. These caps were highly personal. The men were bundled up against the severe cold and could only be recognized by the colours and patterns of their caps. Presumably this is the reason why the caps went with them into their graves.\n\n\nThe hats look remarkably modern, especially if you zoom in. And in fact here are some modern caps, called Deadman Hats, inspired by the old ones. (More info and context for the Dutch hats can be found in this 2016 post from the blog A Bluestocking Knits.)\nAnd this is maybe tangential, but it reminds me of an 18th-century kerfuffle I read about once, in which the young poet Thomas Chatterton claimed to have discovered a 15th-century poem, until a reference within the poem — to knitting — gave it away as contemporary, and presumably as written by Chatterton himself. Or that’s how I remember it, anyway … Although it looks like subsequent research places the advent of knitting earlier than believed at the time. \nEven more tangential, to the above tangent: The smoking-gun reference to knitting doesn’t seem to actually appear in the poem, at least not as I’m currently finding it. (??) (The reference: “She sayde as her whyte hondes whyte hosen was knyttinge, Whatte pleasure ytt ys to be married!”) … Actually, I think I’m in over my head. … The “history of knitting” Wikipedia page also generally confirms this impression (of being in over my head). \nTags: history · knitting · Rijksmuseum\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

So today I want to recognize my readers who are in earlier stages of their Bach journeys, and in this post I’ll be recommending some of the grassier pathways into this music.\nOf the tracks and musicians he linked to, my favorite is the Yo-Yo Ma, Chris Thile, and Edgar Meyer rendition of Bach’s Trio Sonata No. 6 in G Major (above), from their Bach Trios album of 2017. I also loved Brad Mehldau’s Prelude No. 3 in C Major from The Well-Tempered Clavier Book I, which Goldfine describes as “damned perfect, a one track playlist on repeat forever.” \nTags: Brad Mehldau · Chris Thile · classical music · Edgar Meyer · Evan Goldfine · Johann Sebastian Bach · music · Yo-Yo Ma\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

          "description": "Since the early 70s, the Native Youth Olympics have showcased the traditional games of the Alaska Native people:\nOur Alaska Native ancestors developed traditional games in order to test and prove crucial abilities that governed everyday life. Competition was created with each other to hone their ability to hunt and fish for daily survival in the traditional way of life. The creators of the NYO Games wanted an opportunity to demonstrate their favorite traditional Native contests of their forefathers.\n\n\nI found out about this via a highlight reel on Instagram — here’s last year’s competition highlights:\n\nYou can check out a list of the competitive events; they include:\nOne-foot High Kick: “In many cultures, the One-Foot High Kick was used for signaling a successful hunt.”\nIndian Stick Pull: “The Indian Stick Pull represents grabbing a slippery salmon, and was used traditionally to develop hand and arm strength.”\n\n\n\nKneel Jump: “Historically, the Kneel Jump was a game used to strengthen the leg muscles for jumping from ice floe to ice floe, and for lifting prey after a successful hunt.”\n\n\n\nSeal Hop: “The Seal Hop is a variation of the Inuit Knuckle Hop, and used traditionally as a game of endurance and stamina, and for sneaking up on a seal, mimicking the mammal’s movement on the ice.”\n\n\n\nTwo-foot High Kick: “The Two-Foot High Kick was historically used to communicate the success of a spring hunt.”\n\nI love these events. I think my favorite is a reintroduced event for the 2024 games (just concluded): the Toe Kick, which returned after a 10-year hiatus. Here’s how you do it:\n\nHere’s a short documentary about the NYO and athlete Autumn Ridley from 2013 — her event is the Alaskan High Kick, perhaps the most impressively athletic event:\n\nTags: Native Americans · sports · video\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

We didn’t have a gaming system in my house growing up — I had to settle going over to my friend Steve’s house for Atari 2600 and my big city cousins’ Intellivision — but we did have a couple of these handheld games. Specifically: Baseball (upper right), Football 2 (lower left), and Q*bert (lower right). The football game was my favorite. I played it for hours and hours — so many touchdowns. (And look at these Soviet handhelds!)\nFriends at school had other games: I particularly remember the watches, some of the mini arcade cabinets from Coleco, and these pre-Game Boy Nintendo handhelds. The teachers hated them…I think they probably got banned at some point.\nI know that my dad still has these games stashed somewhere in the house I grew up in…I’d love to play Football 2 again. 🤖🏈 (via present and correct)\nTags: video games\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

          "description": "Data artist Robert Hodgin recently created a feedback loop between Midjourney and ChatGPT-4 — he prompted MJ to create an image of an old man in a messy room wearing a VR headset, asked ChatGPT to describe the image, then fed that description back into MJ to generate another image, and did that 10 times. Here was the first image:\n\nAnd here’s one of the last images:\n\nRecursive art like this has a long history — see Alvin Lucier’s I Am Sitting in a Room from 1969 — but Hodgin’s project also hints at the challenges facing AI companies seeking to keep their training data free of material created by AI. Ted Chiang has encouraged us to “think of ChatGPT as a blurry jpeg of all the text on the Web”:\nIt retains much of the information on the Web, in the same way that a jpeg retains much of the information of a higher-resolution image, but, if you’re looking for an exact sequence of bits, you won’t find it; all you will ever get is an approximation. But, because the approximation is presented in the form of grammatical text, which ChatGPT excels at creating, it’s usually acceptable. You’re still looking at a blurry jpeg, but the blurriness occurs in a way that doesn’t make the picture as a whole look less sharp.\n\n\nAnd we already know what you get if you recursively save JPEGs…\n\nSee also La Demoiselle d’Instagram, I Am Sitting in a Room (with a video camera), Google Image Search Recursion, and Dueling Carls.\nTags: art · artificial intelligence · ChatGPT · Midjourney · recursion · Robert Hodgin · Ted Chiang\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

Our traditional stories tell us that at one point we all spoke the same language … we still do. If we find the time to truly listen, we might recognize ourselves in the melting permafrost or the fallen birch, but we might also recognize ourselves in the songs of the birds or the freshness of the Arctic breeze. There is still hope when we experience life. We should all fall in love with the places we live and let this love drive our determination to protect the waters, the salmon, the caribou, and all our plant relatives so that future generations may also experience such joy and sustenance.\n\n\nHave a good weekend, everyone.\nTags: Alaska · Johann Sebastian Bach · music · Princess Daazhraii Johnson · Yo-Yo Ma\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

It seems everyone’s talking up the Financial Times lately, so I went and followed them on Instagram. \nThe first post in their feed was for an essay by Janan Ganesh, about how although the American self-help industry makes it seems like most mistakes can be salvaged, many are in fact unsalvageable and life-destroying. An excerpt: \nThe sur­prise of middle age, and the ter­ror of it, is how much of a per­son’s fate can boil down to one mis­judge­ment.\nSuch as? What in par­tic­u­lar should the young know? If you marry badly — or marry at all, when it isn’t for you — don’t assume the dam­age is recov­er­able. If you make the wrong career choice, and real­ise it as early as age 30, don’t count on a way back. … A big [mistake], or just an early one, can fore­close all hope of the life you wanted.\n\n\nAt first I found it oddly cheering (if I can’t fix my mistakes, I might as well relax and accept my circumstances), but then I found it sad. (Does my husband feel like he made a life-destroying mistake by marrying me? LMAO.) Now I’m more like ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ because things can only ever go the way they go. Anyway, I’m not yet a FT subscriber, but it was a nudge.\nTags: Financial Times · Janan Ganesh · life · mistakes · self-help\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

I don’t know if I’m going to watch it, but I couldn’t really look away. \nArnow also stars as… \nan emotionally detached young Brooklynite drifting through unremarkable days and nights. Neither her on-again-off-again BDSM relationship with a mildly disinterested older dom, nor her nondescript corporate job, appear to bring her any satisfaction.\n\n\nAnd yet “she finds a core of poignant truth about the ways people search for … emotional happiness and sexual gratification” (per the Lincoln Center summary). It’s currently at a 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, FWIW. (This bit also made me laugh out loud.)\nTags: Joanna Arnow · movies · trailers · video\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

          "description": "I love this: The Pudding ran an online experiment where they started with a shape (like a straight line or circle) and asked people to trace, as best they could, the tracing of the person before them. This resulted in a series of “flipbook” animation of how the shapes evolved over time — invariably, a squiggle.\n\nOne thing I noticed right away was how all the squiggles ended up squished over on the right side of the screen. The Pudding team had a theory on why that happened (the 3:20 mark in this video):\nI found this study from like 35 years ago - they were trying to figure out why people kept missing their targets on touch screens. They found people tended to touch below their target and people tended to touch closer to the edges of the screen. And so I figure if it’s like right-handers who are missing, you’re going to be missing to the right. We probably had about half the users on mobile and 90% of the those half are probably going to be right-handed so it would make sense that it would gradually go to the right.\n\n\nGo read the rest of the post — they also did an experiment about people’s inclination to draw penises on “any free-form drawing project on the internet”.

If you build a circular trough with just the right dimensions and fill it with lighter fluid, a flame will travel around it. And other shapes will do other things — the effect created by the star/octopus shape is especially cool. The effect is an example of an excitable medium:\nAn excitable medium is a nonlinear dynamical system which has the capacity to propagate a wave of some description, and which cannot support the passing of another wave until a certain amount of time has passed (known as the refractory time).\nA forest is an example of an excitable medium: if a wildfire burns through the forest, no fire can return to a burnt spot until the vegetation has gone through its refractory period and regrown.\n\n\nOther examples:\nNormal and pathological activities in the heart and brain can be modelled as excitable media. A group of spectators at a sporting event are an excitable medium, as can be observed in a Mexican wave (so-called from its initial appearance in the 1986 World Cup in Mexico).\n\n\n(via waxy)\nTags: science · Steve Mould · video\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

Here’s my situation: I’ve been riding for 3.5 years now on a Kona Honzo hardtail (which I really love) and am pondering a full-suspension bike purchase. They are $$$, but I want to do more riding this summer & fall — including some downhilling on some local lift-serviced trails here in VT (Bolton, Killington, Sugarbush, Burke) — and it feels like it’s the right time to invest in an upgrade.\nI would say I’m an intermediate rider (but more towards the beginner end of the spectrum than the expert end). I love flowy trails and can do small jumps and such, but I’m not super fast and am still learning how to turn properly in the berms. I’m never going to be a super aggressive rider but I’d like to progress. A lot of the stuff I ride is up and down, so I need something that climbs well (not looking for a downhill bike). I’m 6’ and 155# if that matters. My Honzo is a large and has 29” wheels, which I like. I’ve ridden a Kona Process 153 29 and that felt good, although maybe a little squishy (but maybe everything feels squishy after a hardtail).\nThere are good bike shops around here and I’m definitely going to talk to them about what I’m looking for, but I’m wondering if anyone out there has thoughts about brands (particularly those that are known for quality (and ones that aren’t)), what to look for, what to stay away from, etc. Should I buy used? If so, good places to buy used? (I know about Pinkbike.) Any help or advice is appreciated, either in the comments below or via email. Thanks!\nTags: biking\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

After you post a new comment, you’ve got 10 minutes to edit it — to fix any typos, formatting slip-ups, or quick extra thoughts. After 10 minutes, the comment is locked. Edited comments are denoted by some text (“Edited”) next to the timestamp of the comment and you can click on it to see the comment’s original text.\n2. A (hopefully) less confusing posting interface. I still haven’t totally dialed this in, but the inline reply box wasn’t working, particularly when you tried replying to the last comment in a thread and then you had Dueling Comment Textareas but only one was the One True Textarea — chaos.

When I write, I tend to listen to chill stuff so I can concentrate — classical, vaporwave, soundtracks, Jon Hopkins, Sigur Rós, Tycho, Boards of Canada, things like that — but when designing or programming, I need something faster with a beat to spur me onwards.\nSo anyway, I was about to switch from electronica to something by kottke.org favorites The Hood Internet when I thought to check their website to see if they’d released any new mixtapes. And lo — they had (sorta). The Lost Mixtape is a 45-minute mix of music from circa 2005-2009, discovered on some dusty old hard drive and recently finished up & released for our listening pleasure.\n\nThe bit at around 16:00 where they mix Milkshake and So Electric is just superb.

          "description": "Really fascinating piece by Michael Habib in Scientific American about how amazing feathers are: they come in so many different shapes and sizes and do so many things (insulate, keep dry, flying, noise dampening, etc. etc. etc.) And I loved the opening anecdote:\nIn October 2022 a bird with the code name B6 set a new world record that few people outside the field of ornithology noticed. Over the course of 11 days, B6, a young Bar-tailed Godwit, flew from its hatching ground in Alaska to its wintering ground in Tasmania, covering 8,425 miles without taking a single break. For comparison, there is only one commercial aircraft that can fly that far nonstop, a Boeing 777 with a 213-foot wingspan and one of the most powerful jet engines in the world. During its journey, B6-an animal that could perch comfortably on your shoulder-did not land, did not eat, did not drink and did not stop flapping, sustaining an average ground speed of 30 miles per hour 24 hours a day as it winged its way to the other end of the world.\nMany factors contributed to this astonishing feat of athleticism-muscle power, a high metabolic rate and a physiological tolerance for elevated cortisol levels, among other things. B6’s odyssey is also a triumph of the remarkable mechanical properties of some of the most easily recognized yet enigmatic structures in the biological world: feathers. Feathers kept B6 warm overnight while it flew above the Pacific Ocean. Feathers repelled rain along the way. Feathers formed the flight surfaces of the wings that kept B6 aloft and drove the bird forward for nearly 250 hours without failing.\n\n\n \nTags: birds · flying · Michael Habib · science\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

          "description": "I’ve been thinking about something I posted last week — in an excerpt from his new book The Work of Art, former New York magazine editor Adam Moss described the art he makes as bad: “When I left my job, I began to paint more seriously,” he wrote. “That was the beginning of my torment: I just wasn’t very good.” Or as he put it to The New Yorker: “I kind of just wasn’t any good.” Or to Vanity Fair: “I really wanted to be a good painter. What a fucking idiot I was.” Or on NPR, “I really wanted to be good, and it made the act of making art so frustrating for me.”\nThe book is mostly about how other artists make their work, but I’m currently more interested in what Moss has to say about himself and his art. \nLater in the VF and NPR interviews, Moss says that the main lesson he learned from making the book is that with art, it’s the journey not the destination — or, “the making, not the made” (“It’s the most banal observation”) — but of course I still went looking for his paintings online. I want to see them! I didn’t find anything (per the VF article, he hasn’t shared anything publicly yet), but to Moss I say: Show them! Maybe it doesn’t matter if they’re not good. Maybe the worse, the better. \nTags: Adam Moss · art · books · creative processes · painting\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

          "description": "Several years ago in the Guardian, Oliver Burkeman wrote a piece called This column will change your life: Helsinki Bus Station Theory. It’s about how difficult it can be as a creative person to find your way to making work that feels like it’s uniquely yours.\nThere are two dozen platforms, Minkkinen explains, from each of which several different bus lines depart. Thereafter, for a kilometre or more, all the lines leaving from any one platform take the same route out of the city, making identical stops. “Each bus stop represents one year in the life of a photographer,” Minkkinen says. You pick a career direction — maybe you focus on making platinum prints of nudes — and set off. Three stops later, you’ve got a nascent body of work. “You take those three years of work on the nude to [a gallery], and the curator asks if you are familiar with the nudes of Irving Penn.” Penn’s bus, it turns out, was on the same route. Annoyed to have been following someone else’s path, “you hop off the bus, grab a cab… and head straight back to the bus station, looking for another platform”. Three years later, something similar happens. “This goes on all your creative life: always showing new work, always being compared to others.” What’s the answer? “It’s simple. Stay on the bus. Stay on the fucking bus.”\n\n\n(via phil gyford)\nTags: Arno Minkkinen · art · Oliver Burkeman · photography\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

The video version of the visualization is embedded above.\nA year from now, in 1998, a researcher named Vincent Felitti will publish a paper that drastically changes the way we think about these kids — and their childhood.\nThe research will show that these childhood stressors and traumas — called Adverse Childhood Experiences — have a lifelong effect on our health, relationships, happiness, financial security, and pretty much everything else that we value. It will kickstart decades of research that shows that our childhood experiences shape our adulthood far more than we ever thought.\n\n\nThis is a good companion to a recent post, End-Stage Poverty Is Killing People in Safety Net-Free America.\nTags: Alvin Chang · infoviz · The Pudding · USA · video\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

They jump just 2 feet off the ice to take their first swim, according to National Geographic. \nOthers have jumped from a much a higher altitude, heading to “sheer ice cliffs” knowingly to make the first jump. Satellites have recorded the death-defying jumps since 2009, but what happens next has remained a mystery until now.\n\n\nHaving watched the video, “leap” and “jump” are charitable descriptions of what the penguins are doing here. “Flop”, “plop”, and “fall” might be better…penguins are all kinds of cool, but no one has ever accused them of being graceful out of the water.\nTags: Antarctica · penguins · video\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

Many people die here in the world’s richest country not because they are sick but because they are poor and our systems of government, justice, business, and health care don’t do enough to help them (or, more cynically and perhaps truthfully, actively work against helping them).\nThis is one of those pieces where I want to quote every single paragraph, but I’ll start with this one (bold mine):\nSafety-net hospitals and clinics care for a population heavily skewed toward the poor, recent immigrants and people of color. The budgets of these places are forever tight. And anyone who works in them could tell you that illness…",

          "description": "This is wonderful: a collection of video clips of Charles Schulz drawing his iconic Peanuts comic strip — “everything I could find of Charles Schulz drawing his Peanuts characters” in the words of the compiler.\nUnfortunately, I’m not highly educated. I’m merely a high school graduate. I studied art in a correspondence course because I was afraid to go to art school. I couldn’t see myself sitting in a room where everyone else in the room could draw much better than I and this way I was protected by drawing at home and simply mailing my drawings in and having them criticized.\nI wish I had a better education but I think that my entire background made me well-suited for what I do. If I could write better than I can, perhaps I would have tried to become a novelist and I might have become a failure. If I could draw better than I can, I might have tried to become an illustrator or an artist and would have failed there. But my entire being seems to be just right for being a cartoonist.\n\n\nCharles Schulz: Unbothered. Moisturized. Happy. In his lane. Focused. Flourishing.\nSee also a 90-minute compilation of cartoonists working (from the same YT channel) and Chuck Jones demonstrating how to draw Bugs Bunny and other characters.

If the moon were a little bit smaller or farther away, we wouldn’t have total eclipses where you can look directly at the sun, see the corona, the sky goes dark, you see a sunset effect all around the horizon, etc. That is some spooky magical shit. Ted Underwood put it this way:\nRandom accident that the moon and sun are the same apparent size here.

What is the world going to look like in 20 or 30 or 80 years? This TED-Ed video describes that bleak potential future.\nReports on heatwaves and wildfires regularly fill the evening news. Summer days exceed 40 degrees in London and 45 degrees in Delhi, as extreme heat waves are now 8 to 9 times more common. These high temperatures prompt widespread blackouts, as power grids struggle to keep up with the energy demands needed to properly cool homes. Ambulance sirens blare through the night, carrying patients suffering from heatstroke, dehydration, and exhaustion. The southwestern United States, southern Africa, and eastern Australia experience longer, more frequent, and more severe droughts.\nMeanwhile, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Japan face more frequent heavy rainfall as rising temperatures cause water to evaporate faster, and trap more water in the atmosphere. As the weather becomes more erratic, some communities are unable to keep pace with rebuilding what’s constantly destroyed.\n\n\n(via open culture)\nTags: climate crisis · video\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

In this video compilation, the director talks about how poor mental health inhibits art & creativity.\n\nIt stands to reason: the more you suffer, the less you want to create. If you’re truly depressed, they say you can’t even get out of bed, let alone create. It occupies the whole brain, poisons the artist, poisons the environment; little room for creativity.\n\n\nOpen Culture has more on how Lynch uses transcendental meditation to improve his mental health…and a great anecdote about the one time Lynch tried therapy:\nIn one Charlie Rose interview, a clip from which appears in the video, he even tells of the time he went to therapy. The beginning of this story makes it in, but not the end: Lynch asked his new therapist “straight out, right up front, ‘Could this process that we’re going to go through affect creativity?’ And he said, ‘David, I have to be honest with you, it could” — whereupon Lynch shook the man’s hand and walked right back out the door.\n\n\n \nTags: David Lynch · video\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

I was worrying what ‘people would think’ of a decision I had made, and she said, “Amanda, There is no audience.”\n\n\nThe tweet went viral, so this probably isn’t news to a lot of readers.

Today is the solar eclipse, it’s supposed to be mostly sunny here in Colchester, VT, we’ve got 3 minutes and 16 seconds of totality to enjoy, and I built a solar filter for my telescope (and binoculars!), so kottke.org is going to take the day off. Edith and I will see you back here tomorrow.\nIn the meantime, are you doing anything for the eclipse? Anyone got any crazy camera/telescope setups? Do you think Instagram is going to crash this afternoon? Will I completely lose my mind if a cloud drifts in front of the sun today at 3:26pm ET? Is it a coincidence or a miracle that we happen to be alive during the relatively brief period of time when the moon almost exactly covers the sun, resulting in total solar eclipses? Could you imagine if the eclipse somehow doesn’t happen today??!\nTags: 2024 solar eclipse · astronomy · kottke.org · Sun\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

          "description": "In 1900, celebrated magician (and astronomy enthusiast) Nevil Maskelyne travelled to North Carolina to film a solar eclipse on May 28, 1900. The Royal Astronomical Society and the British Film Institute reckon this is “the first surviving astronomical film in the world”.\nIn 1898 he travelled to India to photograph an eclipse. He succeeded but the film can was stolen on his return journey home. \nIt was not an easy feat to film. Maskelyne had to make a special telescopic adapter for his camera to capture the event. This is the only film by Maskelyne that we know to have survived.\nThe original film fragment held in The Royal Astronomical Society’s archive has been painstakingly scanned and restored in 4K by conservation experts at the BFI National Archive, who have reassembled and retimed the film frame by frame. The film is part of BFI Player’s recently released Victorian Film collection, viewers are now able to experience this first film of a solar eclipse since the event was originally captured over a century ago.\n\n\n(via boing boing)\nTags: astronomy · Nevil Maskelyne · science · Sun · video\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

It’s a trailer for The Sound of Knitting, “an evening where classical music and knitting merge.” The popular designers and podcasters Arne & Carlos teamed up with the Norwegian string instrument group (heh) Trondheimsolistene to make a concert/tutorial/behind-the-scenes knitting video, available for purchase. In addition to featuring knitting-friendly music, the video includes a tour of the Norwegian municipality of Selbu, famous for its gorgeous mittens, as well as a virtual class on how to knit those mittens. It all seems lovely, although I confess I was slightly disappointed that “the sound of knitting” wasn’t an ASMR video of needles clicking, although I’m sure that’s out there, too. I mean, I know it is because I’ve seen it.\nPlus, as a recent NY Times story outlined, handwork is good for the brain. \nTags: Arne & Carlos · classical music · knitting · Trondheimsolistene\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

In response, Native North American societies developed a deep distrust of the centralization, hierarchy, and inequality of the previous era, which they blamed for the famines and disruptions that had hit cities hard. They turned away from omnipotent leaders and the cities they ruled, and built new, smaller-scale ways of living, probably based in part on how their distant ancestors lived.\n\n\nWhile Europeans reacted to the Little Ice Age by centralizing and militarizing under hereditary absolute monarchs, Native Americans went in a decidedly different direction:\nTh…",

It’s been with us for 3 million years, since before humans were homo sapiens. We have evidence of it in the mummies of ancient Egypt, and it’s mentioned in the Hebrew Bible.\nWe’ve made extraordinary medical advances. Vaccines, antibiotics, and clean water have saved millions of lives. And yet despite that, in 2022, this disease killed more people than malaria, typhoid, cholera, homicide, and war…combined.\nIt has gone by many names. In ancient China, it was known as huaifu, meaning “destroyed palace.” In ancient Hebrew, “schachepheth,” meaning wasting away. The 19th-century term: “consumption,” for the way it seemed to consume the body. Today, we call it tuberculosis.\n\n\n \nTags: disease · John Green · medicine · science · video\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

I also liked the idea that creative projects just have to take as long as they take and be as hard as they are. Robinson’s new book is about Genesis — she calls the Bible “the most complex document on the planet” — but in the interview they touch on several non-religious topics, too (like the above). Meanwhile I’m enjoying reading the negative reviews of her book on Amazon, which is probably bad (of me).\nTags: interviews · Marilynne Robinson · religion · Tyler Cowen\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

          "description": "Ryan Williams is an Australian scooter and BMX rider who does wild tricks that make me nervous. In 2013 he perfected a back flip with a nothing front scooter flip, which means he does a backflip while his scooter does a front flip, and then he spent about 10 years trying to get it done on a bike. Travis Pastrana dubbed it the Free Willy. Below is an example of a slightly different trick where he does a front flip instead of a backflip, except this one is easy because he can kind of see where the bike is. Easy. This one’s the easy one.\n\nHere’s a behind the scenes of what it took him to figure out the Free Willy. At 1:40 you can see the first time he does it successfully on a scooter, and about 6:35 is when he gets it on the bike. Incredible stuff.\n\nWilliams won a gold with this trick at the 2023 X Games, obviously.  \nTags: bicycles · biking · BMX · Ryan Williams\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

The old-school flavor sold well in soda parlors from the 1950s to the 1970s, and many Canadians now consider it a childhood classic. As curious as it may seem, kids (and nostalgic adults) are among the biggest fans of the citrus and black licorice combination.\n\nTigers Blood sorbet is a sorbet with strawberry, coconut, and watermelon, and maybe we’ll make that one, too. \nDepending on who you ask, Tiger’s Blood could have originated as early as the 1940s or as late as the 1990s and was invented anywhere from Hawaii to Texas. Regardless of what the true story is, it’s safe to say that its creation was a success as it remains incredibly popular across the country.\n\n\n\n\nTigers Blood is also the name of the new album by Waxahatchee. \n\nOn Tigers Blood, no bond is linear or static. Some of these songs sound ready to run, bursting from the traps; others take their ease with intoxicating beauty. Love boomerangs and comes back. Sisters have an unexpected showdown about their respective heady and cautious approaches to life. \n\n\n\nSee how it’s all come together now? \nTags: ice cream · Waxahatchee\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

          "description": "A conversation at dinner with the kids left me wanting to know how to rhyme in sign language and when I found out, it feels like it should have been obvious. \nIn phonology (the study of the smallest units of language), the parts of a signed word are: handshape, location, palm orientation, movement, and non-manual signal. They are called parameters. Each parameter has a number of primes. In sign language specifically ASL, the same parameter in two or more words (signs) are repeated. The parts may be the same handshape, movement, and/or location, or combined, but the handshape rhyme is the most commonly used.\n\n\n\n\nAnd here’s an example of ASL poetry where you can clearly see the rhymes and music of the words in her poem. The poet, Christine Marshall, didn’t caption the poem and suggested viewers suggest a translation in the comments. The pinned translation is below. \n\n“Deaf Heart by Christine Marshall\nSee also, Jason’s post about ASL ‘Lose Yourself’, ASL Hamilton, and translating music.\nTags: American Sign Language · poetry\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

          "description": "Dolly Parton’s ‘I Will Always Love You’ was released 50 years ago a couple weeks ago and it’s a very good song. We all know Parton famously wrote IWALY and Jolene on the same day, which, like, one time I made 4 batches of ice cream and packed them all into pints and cleaned the machine all in an hour and forty five minutes and that’s kind of the same thing if you squint. She wrote the song to let Porter Wagoner know she was leaving his show and striking out on her own and that makes me mad because imagine working with someone so annoying you have to write one of the best songs ever written to get out of it. \nThe year after it was released, Elvis was going to record it, but Tom Parker, his manager, insisted on half the publishing rights and Dolly said no, like a G. The whole germ for this post, my entire reason for being at this moment, was seeing that fact about Elvis and knowing Dolly teases IWALY not once, not twice, but, well, OK, only twice, on her duets album. It’s on Wrecking Ball, and she teases it AND sings about the whole episode on I Dreamed About Elvis. Priscilla Presley told Dolly Elvis loved the song so much and sang it to her on the day of their divorce. I do wish we could hear an Elvis recording of IWALY.\nDolly rerecorded the song for Best Little Whorehouse in Texas, but when Whitney covered IWALY, Dolly called it “One of the biggest thrills and one of the most overwhelming feelings I’ve ever had about anything in my life,” but that almost didn’t happen, too, twice, because they were going to do ‘What Becomes of the Broken Hearted’ before that song got featured in Steel Magnolias (starring Dolly, wtf) and then Whitney was set to cover the Linda Ronstadt version which leaves off a verse at the end, but Dolly interceded at the last moment to set them straight.\nFinally, my bar in Cambridge has a Dolly Parton-themed bathroom which has 5 stars on google maps and was written up in the New York Times.\nTags: Dolly Parton · elvis presley · music · Whitney houston\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

On the other hand, the documentary is called When Whales Could Walk, so that’s on me. I should have seen that coming. I did that to myself. And now I’m doing it to you.\nThis fossil graveyard, millions of years old, is known as the “Valley of the Whales.” Now, paleontologists have unearthed a whole new species of ancient whale dating to 43 million years ago, and this predator wasn’t just able to swim – it also had four legs and could walk. \n\n\n\n(via @propcazhpm.bsky.social)\nTags: pbs · whales\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

The original version topped out at 8. \n\nHere’s the original.\n\n\nHere’s a country version.\n\n\nHere’s a punk cover validating my theory stating pop songs usually sound good as punk songs.\n\nAnyway, I was thinking about this because a few years ago I made a playlist for the kids of all the covers of Dancing on My Own I could find and there were 56 back then.

Now that April Fools has been coopted by try-hard brands, uh, trying too hard, a really good and cool thing for a brand to do would be to announce something what seems like a joke on April Fools and then actually deliver.

The Museum Speelklok appears to contain the second largest such collection in the world behind the Musical Museum in Brentford, which has them beat on self-playing instruments, though it’s not clear how many musical clocks they’ve got at MM. Regardless, the Utrecht Musical Clock Museum appears delightful and you should visit after visiting the fish doorbell.\nUpdate:\nWintergatan. The marble machine in the video below is exhibited at Museum Speelklok.\n\n(Jason previously wrote about Martin Molin’s Wintergatan projects in 2020, which were inspired by Martin’s visit to Museum Speelklok in 2016.) \nTags: clocks · Martin Molin · museums · musical instruments · utrecht · Wintergatan\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

          "description": "Fish in the Netherlands travel upstream to spawn in the spring, but unfortunately for the fish in Utrecht, the boat lock on the river through the city is closed in the spring. Ecologists put a camera on the bottom of the lock, and viewers around the world can watch a livestream of the camera and, when they see a fish, press a doorbell to open the lock allowing the fish the opportunity to continue swimming upstream to their destiny.\nThis is a YouTube livestream of the doorbell camera, which is what gets shown to viewers on days like today when more than 900 people are watching the camera, but fear not because they post a weekly highlight reel.\n\nYou probably missed the pike and ide, but perch, common roach, and freshwater bream should be swimming by around now.\nPS the domain is visdeurbel.nl, which translates into English as Fish Doorbell, and I think Dutch is a very charming language.\n(via @danirabaiotti.bsky.social)\nTags: fish · utrecht\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

Initially the researchers missed the find because they weren’t looking for a first century C.E. bone full of drugs in a bone stack (that’s a needle in a haystack joke I was afraid you wouldn’t get, so I’m just pointing it out, but if you did get it, I’m sorry for not trusting you as a reader.).\nThe bone container, discovered when a birch pitch plug was dislodged, was full of black hebane seeds which back in the olden olden olden days was used for “relieving pain and helping with difficult pregnancies. Yet ingesting too much, one Roman author wrote, could lead to “alienation of [the] mind or madness”.”\nAncient Roman authors were clearly familiar with the plant. Pliny the Elder, Plutarch, and others wrote about black henbane, along with its closely related but less potent relatives, white and yellow henbane. These plants—in the form of ointments, potions, or burning smoke—were prescribed for everything from earaches and toothaches to flatulence and “pains of the womb.” Ancient scholars also warned against taking too much because of the potential for hallucinogenic effects; Pliny counseled physicians to avoid it entirely.\n\n\n\n\nThis quotation submitted without comment: “When you think about how much was in there, your imagination really goes wild.”\nThis video submitted without comment, as well:\n\nTags: archaeology · drugs · utrecht\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

Just watch him do all sorts of triple cows lutz axles better than anyone’s ever done it. My favorite part is when he does the two twisty jumps in a row, which he does at least 3 different times. Imagine being half this good at anything, let alone something as difficult as jumping in circles WITH RAZOR BLADES SCREWED TO YOUR DOC MARTENS.\nMalinin landed a quadruple Axel, quad Lutz, quad loop, quad Salchow, another quad Lutz and a quad toe loop, then finished his four-minute skate with a a triple Lutz-triple Axel finale.\n\n\nI don’t live too far from Salem, and they still put people on trial for this kind of sorcery there.\n\nTags: figure skating · ilia malinin\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

          "description": "According to this 2014 article in Slate, roasting vegetables is a cooking technique popularized only in the 80s/90s.\nThe concept of roasting as a general vegetable technique seems to have originated in a famous Italian restaurant: Johanne Killeen and George Germon’s Al Forno, which opened in Providence, Rhode Island, in 1980. Forno means oven in Italian, and the critically acclaimed chefs made ample use of that apparatus.\n\n\nThis is a fact, which makes me feel old because I lived through it and makes me feel young because I lived through it. Old because I can remember a time before roasting vegetables was how anyone who is anyone prepared them, and young because what other cooking techniques are we going to invent during my lifetime? It’s a little like watching cities develop. For example, I used to work down in Fort Point in Boston and there were a ton of parking lots and then the guy who owned the parking lots sold them, bought the Los Angeles Baseball Dodgers and those parking lots have become a huge and glitzy neighborhood (?) with condos and offices and commerce\nAs another aside, there’s a 1993 NYT article quoted in the Slate piece and I’m quoting the first three sentences here for reasons I will expound upon afterward. \nRoasting wafts through the senses. In culinary terms it is freighted with mouthwatering aroma, comforting warmth, a crisping sizzle and anticipated succulence. And lately it is more appreciated than ever.\n\n\nAnyway, the use of “freighted” just reminded me of the Emily Dickinson quotation, “The freight should be proportioned to the groove” from the poem That Love is all there is. It’s a delightful poem and you can read it in about 3 seconds and think about it for the rest of your life.\nTags: cooking · food · vegetables\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

          "description": "Ghanaian sculptor Paa Joe makes coffins (both human-sized and mini sculptures) modeled after real-life objects that were important to the deceased. He just opened his first NYC solo show at Superhouse; from their description of his work:\nPaa Joe is a second-generation fantasy coffin maker, contributing to an artistic tradition of great importance around Ghana’s capital, Accra. Known as abeduu adeka, or proverb boxes, these end-of-life vessels illustrate Ghanaian beliefs concerning life and death. Since the 1960s, the artist has meticulously carved and painted figurative coffins, representing various living and inanimate objects symbolizing the deceased (an onion for a farmer, an eagle for a community leader, a sardine for a fisherman, etc.).\n\n\nYou read more about Paa Joe’s work and see more of his pieces at The Guardian:\n“People celebrate death in Ghana. At a funeral, we have a passion for the person leaving us - there are a lot of people, and a lot of noise,” says Jacob, 28, who has worked with his father for eight years.\nFar from seeing their work as morbid, Jacob says the coffins are celebratory and reflect west African attitudes to death. “It reminds people that life continues after death, that when someone dies they will go on in the afterlife, so it is important that they go in style.”\n\n\nAnd at The Future Perfect, Fad, Hypebeast, and on Instagram.

I picked it up when I stopped drinking, and it’s since become one of the cornerstones of my day. \nAnd then on the other end of the spectrum are the hobbies we discover in mid-life, when there’s less expectation of doing “well” or of turning anything into a career, and those rule, too.

          "description": "the tweet is a photograph of the following letter to the editor of the New York Times Book Review section (not online):\nTO THE EDITOR:\n\nWay back in 1997, when Charles Frazier’s “Cold Mountain” was released, I was given a copy as a present. When I flipped it over, I was struck by a blurb that seemed excessive, bordering on parody. One Rick Bass said of the novel that it “is so magnificent — in every conceivable aspect, and others perviously unimagined — that it has occurred to me that the shadow of this book, and the joy I received in reading it, will fall over every other book I ever read.” It felt so hyperbolic that it put me off trusting blurbs on dust jackets forever. \nSo imagine my surprise when I opened the Feb. 4 By the Book feature to see Rick Bass answer the question “What books are on your night stand?” And he replied, “‘Cold Mountain (‘re-re-re-read).”” He has restored my faith in the humble, oft-dismissed blurb in one fell swoop. It was that important to him! Lesson learned. \nChristopher Vyce\n\n\nAs Ruth put it: “Pure and total delight! A perfect letter!” Here’s Bass’s By the Book interview, by the way. I haven’t read Cold Mountain, but I’m not sure if this makes me want to or not. I’d almost rather leave it as this legendary.\nTags: books · Charles Frazier · Cold Mountain · Rick Bass · Ruth Graham\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

Ryback shows how major players thought they could find some ulterior advantage in managing him. Each was sure that, after the passing of a brief storm cloud, so obviously overloaded that it had to expend itself, they would emerge in possession of power. The corporate bosses thought that, if you looked past the strutting and the performative antisemitism, you had someone who would protect your money. Communist ideologues thought that, if you peered deeply enough into the strutting and the performative antisemitism, you could spy the pattern of a popular revolution. The decent right thought that he was too obviously deranged to remain in power long, and the decent left, tempered by earlier fights against different enemies, thought that, if they forcibly stuck to the rule of law, then the law would somehow by itself entrap a lawless leader. In a now familiar paradox, the rational forces stuck to magical thinking, while the irrational ones were more logical, parsing the brute equations of power. And so the storm never passed. In a way, it still has not.\n\n\nI got this via Clayton Cubitt, who says “History doesn’t repeat itself but it often rhymes.”\nTags: Adam Gopnik · Adolf Hitler · books · Germany · Nazis · politics · Takeover: Hitler’s Final Rise to Power · Timothy Ryback",

From PetaPixel:\nThe Vela Supernova remnant, located about 800 light-years away from Earth, is the cosmic corpse of a massive star that exploded 11,000 years ago. It is one of the closest supernova remnants to Earth and the perfect subject for the remarkable Dark Energy Camera.\nThe supernova is a vast cosmic structure about 100 light-years across. For context, one would have to travel around the Earth 200 million times to have traveled a single light-year.\n\n\n\nThe full image of the supernova remnant is worth exploring. You can also watch this zoom-in of the image to observe the high level of detail available.\n\n(via colossal)\nTags: astronomy · photography · science · space\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",
