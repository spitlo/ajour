Definitely!\nI'd not fixed a Kindle before, but my guess was the USB port was probably at fault. Inspecting it under the microscope (and looking at the mouth of the port) I could see it was definitely the problem. It's understandable that a young child isn't always going to connect the USB cable cleanly and the port had eventually given up the ghost.\nOpening the Kindle Fire is the process of unclipping the edge - there's no screws on the outside. Once open, the main board can be lifted off, on the reverse side (to my photos) is a ribbon cable that can't be disconnected right next to the USB port.\nUsing a hot air gun and lots of constant movement, I was able to free the USB port without melting the ribbon cable or the FPC connector (which is entirely plastic). By keeping the airflow moving it protects plastics from heating up but allows the solder to melt, but it takes practise and a careful hand.\nOnce free, I had a replacement from eBay and once re-installed the Kindle Fire charged up just like old times.\nOne more bit of tech saved from landfill 💪",

          "description": "Cutting to the chase: text editors *and* tabs vs. spaces!  Ooooh!\n\n\nI've had this thing called \"e\" for a while now.  It's a stupid little \nscript which serves to do a couple of things.  It starts my \neditor\nwith a given file, and it kicks it with the right arguments to make it \ndisable line wrapping and to make the [TAB] key actually put in two \nspaces.\n\n\nSo, my dumb script would use \"-w -E -T 2\" most of the time, except when it \nwas running on a Makefile, at which point it would skip those args.  \nSimple enough, right?\n\n\npico is back?  Yes indeed, on Macs, as of 12.3, pico is in fact back.  To \nmake sure I wasn't imagining things, I tracked down a machine that hadn't \nbeen upgraded yet and checked there.  Sure enough, it was in fact nano and \nnot pico.\n\n\nmacOS 12.3 has nano as a symlink... pointing to pico!\n\n\nAt some point, I switched from literal tab characters in my source code to \nblobs of spaces, probably due to using that style at work and not hating \nit.  So, somewhere along the line I actually started depending on nano \nbehavior without realizing it.\n\n\nAs for the lack of a feature in pico itself, it's kind of strange, really.  \nIf you go digging into the source, they have this random.c with a function \ncalled tab which claims to \"simulate tab stop\" using spaces.  That said, I \ncan't find any place where it would be called with the magic values which \nwould make it behave that way.\n\n\nIt wouldn't surprise me if this switch is just more of Apple removing \nGPLed things from their OS - pico seems to use the Apache license.  They \ndumped bash for zsh (MIT license) at some point (Big Sur, I think), and \nnow this?  Okay then.",

          "description": "Here's a very old and stupid trick you could do with some filesystems in \nsome situations back in the day... and might still be able to do in a \nfew places today.\n\n\nThe problem is that while version X might eventually have an exploit, \nit'll get removed and it'll be replaced by version Y without that\nparticular hole.  By the time you get your hands on a tool to break into \nX, it'll be gone.\n\n\nWhat you'd do is create a hard link pointing at the file you wanted to \npreserve, storing it in a spot which was writable by your account.  \nThen, say, /usr/bin/sudo (because that never has security \nissues...) gets replaced at some point with a new file and you get to \nkeep the old version.  When you get the tool to pop it, off you go!\n\n\nOf course, these days, it's not quite so easy on the more modern systems \nyou find.  Debian 11 here won't let me do it - it's EPERM city.  Rocky 8 \n(so CentOS 8 and RHEL 8 too) also won't do it.  They both have some gunk\nin /usr/lib/sysctl.d to lock this down.  But, my old Slackware 14.2 \ninstall of my workstation let me do it the last time I tried about \na year ago.  How about that, huh?  I bet it'd still work if I dug out \nthe old drives and booted them up.\n\n\nIncidentally, this is the magic sauce: /proc/sys/fs/protected_hardlinks\nRead the man page for proc(5) to learn more about it.\n\nhere it is,\nthe thread I read a long time ago.  It's interesting to note that as far \nas I can tell, nothing actually changed upstream.  This left paranoid \nadmins like me with no option but to use the (most excellent) Openwall \npatches to lock down this kind of stuff.  I used that on my machines at \nwork which had non-staff users... just in case.\n\n\nThis whole situation is scary.  \nRead more about it.",

          "description": "One of the fun things I used to do at a prior job was to dig through the \nraw data points which were collected from the *many* servers we had.  I \ncould just pick an interesting-sounding metric and then would just ask \nthe system to show me the top 10 or bottom 10 out of a population of \nthousands or more.\n\n\nTo get my feet wet with the whole \"investigations\" thing that we'd do, I \nstarted looking into this one day and chose one of the many temp sensors \nwhich were being logged by the servers.  I forget exactly which one it \nwas, for there were many.  The CPUs logged it, the chassis logged it, \nthe power supply logged it, and so on.  There were so many choices.\n\n\nI went looking for a reason.  What could possibly explain this?  First \noff, it didn't line up with any obvious pattern in the host names.  The \nhosts were named for whichever team owned them, followed by a sequence \nnumber that was bumped any time a new one was provisioned.  There was no \nsignal to be found in that.\n\n\nThere was more, though.  You could also see a \"rack position\" in this \ndata, and now it started getting interesting.  It seems that all of the \nreally hot machines had a rack position of something low, like 04 or 05, \nand never anything higher than that.  In fact, when looking at a whole \nrack, it was always the lowest number of all of the positions that were \nbeing used.  Now this was worth chasing!\n\n\nIt's good that I asked, since they told me something surprising: \nposition 04 or 05 or whatever was the *bottom* of the rack.  Yes, \nsomehow, the lowest machine in the rack was the hottest!  They found \nthis interesting, too, and wound up digging into it.  Given that I was \nfar away in a distant office, this was the best way for us to proceed.\n\n\nThe problem was that the bottommost server would have nothing below it \nbut just open space until it got to the floor.  That space would not \nmove air efficiently, and it obviously mattered.\n\n\nThis rolled out and my hot spots disappeared.  Fantastic!",

It had a special attachment to let it stay on the rails.  \nAt no point did the arms come down for the crossing.  It managed to \napproach, then the people inside looked around and went through, and the \narms never budged.  There were no flashing lights or bells.\n\n\n\n\ncaught fire.  A bunch of people were hurt.  More were shaken \nup.\n\n\nI'm assuming their construction trucks don't trigger the \"short the \nrails together to signal various things\" logic, either.

In short, it looks like every Raspberry Pi filesystem installed \nfrom any given release image probably ends up with the same\nUUID.\n\n\nFor instance, if you downloaded the \"lite\" version of Raspbian between \nroughly November 8th and January 28th, you probably got a file called \n2021-10-30-raspios-bullseye-armhf-lite.zip.  Inside, there's an image, \nand the idea is that you dump that straight to your SD card, cram it in \nthe Pi, and off you go.  The second partition on that image is an ext4 \nfilesystem which was created on some build machine somewhere.  The UUID \non it never gets \"evolved\" to something else after the install.\n\n\nYou can see it inside the image itself here:\n\n\nOr, if you actually installed a few of these things like I did over the \npast couple of months, you can just 'tune2fs -l /dev/mmcblk0p2' and see \nthe same value in there.\n\n\nDon't end up with a pile of SD cards on your desk and think \"I know, \nI'll use the filesystem UUIDs to track which one goes where\", in other \nwords.\n\n\nIf it's not breaking anything for you, it's probably best to just let it \nbe.  Untangling a boot mess on these weird little boxes is anything but \nfun.\n\nNote: if you're actually on a recent Raspberry Pi, odds are good that \nyour /etc/fstab will be using *partition* UUIDs (PARTUUID=...) and not \nthose of the filesystem.

We agreed to build a new one instead. The result of our work is now part of the exhibition “Énergies légères”, which runs until March 2024.

Wood gas vehicles were a not-so-elegant alternative to their petrol cousins, but their range was comparable to today’s electric vehicles. In Germany alone, around 500,000 wood gas cars, buses, and trucks operated by the end of WWII. An even more cumbersome alternative was the gas bag vehicle. 2\nNowadays, there’s much less firewood available than in the 1940s, especially in industrialized regions.

The House of the Future will bring the Human Power Plant’s “Human Powered Neighbourhood” scenario to life in Bospolder-Tussendijken, Rotterdam, in the coming years. You can already get a taste of it at the Museum Boijmans van Beuningen’s online exhibition (in Dutch).\nSince this community will run largely on human power, we need human power plants. Therefore, Kris De Decker and Marie Verdeil organise an open and collaborative workshop where we will build a fully working bicycle generator based on a second-hand spinning bike. You are welcome to learn, experiment, teach, and help.\nDuring the workshop, we will mount a generator on the bike, build a control panel, and modify devices to run on low voltage. This bicycle generator will be specifically designed to serve as a power source in the communal workshop, so that we can use it to build more stuff we need (including more bike generators).\nProgramme:\nTuesday 10 October (14h-18h): open day House of the Future\nWednesday 11 October (15h-17h): introduction workshop\nThursday 12 October (10h-17h): workshop\nFriday, October 13 (14h-19h): workshop\nSaturday, October 14 (14h-17h): workshop\nWe speak Dutch, English, French, and Spanish. The introduction (11 oct) will be in Dutch only.\nAdmission is free. To participate: just walk in (Jan Kobellstraat 56A, Rotterdam) or send an email to contact [] huisvandetoekomst [] org.\nAll future events will be published on our events page.\n\n\n Illustration: Future vision of the human powered housing block in Rotterdam.

          "description": "erikkwakkel:\nMedieval dachshund - Or: drawing with words\nHere are three examples of a technique called “micrography”: decorative scenes that are drawn with words written in a tiny script. While there are examples from Latin books made in the West (here is one), the technique is particularly common in medieval Hebrew manuscripts. The drawings are usually found in biblical manuscripts and they appear to be commentaries to the text. The technique, whereby a scribe wrote in the smallest handwriting possible, goes back to the 9th century AD. The examples here, from the 13th century, shows just how entertaining the word-made drawings can be: they are an opportunity for the scribe to frolick in the margins of the page - like drawing a creature that looks like a dachshund.\nPic: London, British Library, Additional MS 21160 (13th century, more about the manuscript here).

          "description": "One problem with having a toddler is that there’s so much you can buy them, and it’s so easy to be tempted by all of it. Or to resist 98% of the time, but then cave and still end up having spent hundreds of dollars on sweaters and toothbrushes and sunglasses and shoes. And trampolines and socks and stuffed dragons. It’s just that my daughter likes everything right now, and it makes me feel good to give her something that she likes. Really it’s just the clothes that torment me. She loves new clothes and will put on anything that’s new to her, including all the fabulous hand-me-downs we get. But Mother magazine sometimes hits that 2% sweet (rotten) spot. A couple weeks ago, it got me to buy a little apple sweater, which I love, but which I regret buying in her size (2T) and not in a size that she’d grow into (3T), because it’s basically already too small, which is absurd because it cost $50 (on sale plus shipping and tax). I also put like $200 worth of clothing (on sale!) from Petit Pilou into a digital shopping cart before abruptly closing the tab and shutting off my phone. But I bet if I open it up again it will still be there. The pineapple dresses were really what got me. \nMaybe I just want to dress all in fruit myself, and it pleases me to live through my daughter, since she seems to enjoy it as well. Hanna Andersson has some wonderful fruit clothing, since I’m on the topic. We have their strawberry socks, swimsuit, and hat. \nIf anyone knows of any running clothes with cool fruit patterns, please let me know. I’ve been hoping Janji will bust out with something good (their other patterns are often excellent), and although it would be cool if Tracksmith did something fruity, it would probably be tasteful and realistic, when I’m looking for something neon and extreme. Something cheerful. I hope Santa is listening.\nTags: shopping\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

I don’t know if there was or not, and I am not here to recommend hypnotherapy. However I have remained on the hypnotherapist’s email newsletter, and the above was a single line from one of her recent “Two-Minute Transformation” emails. I might have just been in the right zone to receive it, and/or it might need more context, but it helped me see that much of what I fear is simply having my ego dented, which made it easier to imagine a path forward.

I did, it was a wonderful experience, and I have been knitting mittens from the book ever since (some pictured above). They are exceptionally warm and durable. A bonus is that the patterns are written with a kind of common sense that for me at least made a few steps feel like fun puzzles. (What does she mean by “K both colors, gray then red, into the st that should have been gray”?? … ohhHHhhh!!!) \nI found the book used on Amazon, but other books of Hansen’s are available on her website. My favorite pattern to make is “Sawtooth” (various above and below), but the best are maybe the “Safe Home” ones (center left), found elsewhere online. [thx Cecilia!] Oh also: Pair with Maine’s Bartlett Yarns – perfection.\nOkay one more shot, these are my everyday mittens, I think I’ve been wearing these for the past five winters (Sawtooth pattern).

However, I’m going to try running some old comics here – see below – in the hopes of working up momentum to bring my newsletter back. We’ll see how it goes! \nMore about me?? I’m originally from Cambridge, MA, and although I lived for 16 years in Brooklyn, a couple years ago my husband and I moved to a small town in upstate New York, not too far from Albany. We are now expecting our second daughter, due in a few weeks. \nThanks for reading! \n…Okay, I was hoping to hide these comics behind a “read more” page-break button, but it seems Jason’s interface doesn’t have that option, so I guess I’ll be really taking over the main page. \nAnd so, to kick this off, here is a little story about the first time I saw a bear (from 2022): \n\n\n\n \nTags: bears · comics · greetings\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

I found out about this via organist Anna Lapwood’s Instagram, where she posted a clip of her participation in the show: playing Bach’s Toccata and Fugue in D minor as a lead-in to Insomnia by Faithless. I enjoyed the captions but the sound on her video is not great; I found this video on YouTube with much better sound (relevant part starts at the 4:15 mark):\n\nI would love to have seen this live…I’d have lost my mind at this part.

Perfect title, perfect graphic, perfect subheadline. No notes.\n\nAmazing that an official UN climate report has this much biting personality. You can just sense the no-fucks-givenness of the people who put this together. After all:\nHumanity is breaking all the wrong records when it comes to climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions reached a new high in 2022. In September 2023, global average temperatures were 1.8°C above pre-industrial levels. When this year is over, according to the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service, it is almost certain to be the warmest year on record.\nThe 2023 edition of the Emissions Gap Report tells us that the world must change track, or we will be saying the same thing next year — and the year after, and the year after, like a broken record. The report finds that fully implementing and continuing mitigation efforts of unconditional nationally determined contributions (NDCs) made under the Paris Agreement for 2030 would put the world on course for limiting temperature rise to 2.9°C this century. Fully implementing conditional NDCs would lower this to 2.5°C. Given the intense climate impacts we are already seeing, neither outcome is desirable.\n\n\nThe report credits Beverley McDonald with the cover design — her website is here.\nTags: Beverley McDonald · climate crisis · design\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

          "description": "In what’s been voted the greatest BBC musical performance of all time, David Bowie appeared on Top of the Pops in 1972 to sing Starman and changed the course of musical history.\nThe performance launched Bowie to stardom. Thursday 6th July, 1972, is said to be ‘the day that invented the 80’s’ as so many musicians who went on to be household names saw the performance and it changed their lives. Those watching that night included U2’s Bono, The Cure’s Robert Smith, Boy George, Adam Ant, Mick Jones of the Clash, Gary Kemp of Spandau Ballet, Morrissey and Johnny Marr of the Smiths, Siouxsie Sioux, Toyah Willcox, John Taylor and Nick Rhodes of Duran Duran, Dave Gahan of Depeche Mode and many more. \n\n\nHere’s more from Colin Marshall at Open Culture, who does a great job contextualizing the performance:\n“It’s deceptively easy to forget that in the summer of 1972 David Bowie was still yesterday’s news to the average Top of the Pops viewer, a one-hit wonder who’d had a novelty single about an astronaut at the end of the previous decade,” writes Nicholas Pegg in The Complete David Bowie. But his taking the stage of that BBC pop-musical institution “in a rainbow jumpsuit and shocking red hair put paid to that forever. Having made no commercial impact in the two months since its release, ‘Starman’ stormed up the chart.” As with “Space Oddity,” “the subtext is all: this is less a science-fiction story than a self-aggrandizing announcement that there’s a new star in town.”\n\n\n(via open culture)\nTags: David Bowie · music · video\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

          "description": "In the early days of the telegraph, station operators began sharing the local weather with each other. As the practice became more widespread, people started to realize that what happened in one location translated to later events in another location. Modern weather forecasting and the concept of weather systems were born.\nThe operators had discovered something both interesting and paradoxical, the writer Andrew Blum observes in his book The Weather Machine. The telegraph had collapsed time but, in doing so, it had somehow simultaneously created more of it. Now people could see what the future held before it happened; they could know that a storm was on its way hours before the rain started falling or the clouds appeared in the sky. This new, real-time information also did something else, Blum points out. It allowed weather to be visualized as a system, transforming static, localized pieces of data into one large and ever-shifting whole.\n\n\n \nTags: meteorology · science · telegraph · weather\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

          "description": "In their latest video, Kurzgesagt takes a break from their more serious topics to consider a scenario from the realm of science fiction: interstellar combat. Using technology that is theoretically available to us here on Earth, could a more advanced civilization some 42 light years away destroy our planet without any warning? They outline three potential weapons: the Star Laser, the Relativistic Missile, and the Ultra-Relativistic Electron Beam.\nHere’s what I don’t understand though: how would the targeting work? In order for an alien civilization to hit the Earth with a laser from 42 light years away, it has to not only predict, within a margin of error of the Earth’s diameter, precisely where the Earth is going to be, but also have a system capable of aiming across 42 light years of distance with that precision. Is this even possible? How precisely do we know where the Earth is going to be in 42 years? And if you’re aiming at something 42 light years away, if you move the sights a nanometer, how much angular distance does that shift the the destination by? And how much does the gravity of matter along the way shift the trajectory and is it possible to accurately compensate for that? Maybe this should be their next video…\nTags: Kurzgesagt · physics · science · video · war\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

She said she feared for his safety, that police tend to think of little Black boys as older and less innocent than they really are.

          "description": "About ten years ago, after a long campaign by Navajo Nation member Manny Wheeler, Disney/Lucasfilm released the first Star Wars movie dubbed into the Navajo language. In this clip from the PBS series Native America, the Navajo version of Star Wars is shown at a drive-in in Arizona, with some of the voice actors who contributed to the dub in attendance. Some Navajo feel a strong connection to some of the themes in the movie:\nThe Force and the universe is all interconnected. When you put that in the Navajo language, especially for an elder to hear that, they’re going to just be thinking, like, yeah, of course. It’s not just a movie. That’s stuff we really believe.\n\n\nYou can watch the Navajo version of Star Wars on Disney+ (Finding Nemo too!) and catch the second season of Native America on PBS. Oh, and here’s a movie poster for the film:\n\nTags: language · movies · Native Americans · PBS · Star Wars · video\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

Invented circa 1924, this portable phonograph was powered by a hand-crank and could play 10-inch records. \nAt first glance, the closed Mikiphone appears quite compact, easily fitting inside a purse.\nHowever, it requires some assembly, with its components stored within the case, which, when shut, measures just 11.5 cm in diameter and 4.7 cm in thickness.\nThe recording head and a two-piece Bakelite resonator had to be connected to the foldout tone arm before the shellac disc could be placed on the turntable’s central pin.\nThis precision engineering feat was awarded first prize at an international music exhibition in Geneva in 1927.\n\n\nCourtesy of the Stanford Archive of Recorded Sound, a demonstration of how to assemble the Mikiphone and play records on it:\n\n(via clive thompson)\nTags: music · video\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

          "description": "At the beginning of the ninth episode of his 13-part series Cosmos: A Personal Voyage, Carl Sagan says:\nIf you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe.\n\n\nTaking a page from Sagan’s book, Zack Scholl made a site called Recursive Recipes, which allows you to drill down into the ingredients of some common foods, replacing them with other recipes.\nA recursive recipe is one where ingredients in the recipe can be replaced by another recipe. The more ingredients you replace, the more that the recipe is made truly from scratch.\n\n\nHere’s what the apple pie recipe looks like when you make everything you can from scratch:\n\nYou don’t quite begin at the Big Bang, but if you start with soil, a cow, and some seawater, it’s still going to take you almost 8 years to make that pie. The wheat needed for the flour, for instance:\nPlant winter wheat in fall to allow for six to eight weeks of growth before the soil freezes. This allows time for good root development. If the wheat is planted too early, it may smother itself the following spring and it could be vulnerable to some late-summer insects that won’t be an issue in the cooler fall weather. If winter wheat is planted too late, it will not overwinter well.\n\n\nThis reminds me of Thomas Thwaites’ Toaster Project, in which he built a toaster from scratch:\n\nThwaites reverse engineered a seven dollar toaster into 400 separate parts and then set about recreating steel from iron ore rocks, plastic from microwaved potatoes and copper from homemade bromide mush.\n\n\n(via waxy)\nTags: Carl Sagan · Cosmos · food · how to · Thomas Thwaites · video · Zack Scholl\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

          "description": "Nearly everything about Fortnite’s popular Battle Royale mode is geared towards creating conflict between its players. In this episode of Pop Culture Detective, Jonathan McIntosh explores whether you can be a pacifist in a virtual world filled with war and, beyond that, whether you can make friends with your fiercest enemy. As a Fortnite player who has qualms about even the cartoony violence in the game, I loved this video. It reminded me of Robin Sloan’s piece in the Atlantic from 2018: I Played Fortnite and Figured Out the Universe.\nWhen they’re successful, these negotiations are honestly more nervy and exciting than the game’s most intense shoot-outs. I’m not the only one who thinks so. In forums dedicated to Fortnite Battle Royale, some players share clips of chance alliances, and others reply glumly: “Super rare to find someone [who] won’t shoot you when you emote.” I dream of a Political Fortnite in which victory goes not to the twitchiest sniper but the most charismatic organizer, with factions forming and dissolving… I imagine the fear and thrill of seeing not one but a dozen tiny silhouettes on the far ridge-a war band sweeping fast down the hillside. I’m outnumbered; can I convince them to let me join them?\n\n\n(thx, andy)\nTags: Fortnite · Jonathan McIntosh · video · video games\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

Unless you went to camp as a kid or have spent a bunch of time outdoors, at least some of these techniques will be new to you. I’d never heard of trees growing in a check mark shape. From natural navigation expert Tristan Gooley:\nObviously, all green plants need sunlight. So it’s logical that plants will, all things being equal, tend to grow more abundantly on the side the light comes from. In the northern parts of the world, where the sun is due south in the middle of the day, that means plants are growing more abundantly on the south side.\nTry noticing this in a tree the next time you take a walk outside. You should see that there’s more tree on the south side, unless there are other factors-for instance there are amazing examples of glass buildings that can make trees grow the wrong way. But generally speaking, there should be more of the tree on the south side.\n\n\nGooley is the author of The Lost Art of Reading Nature’s Signs: Use Outdoor Clues to Find Your Way, Predict the Weather, Locate Water, Track Animals — and Other Forgotten Skills and several related books.

          "description": "A few decades ago, Chérie Carter-Scott devised a list of 10 Rules for Being Human, which was published in her 1998 book If Life Is a Game, These Are the Rules. These rules are often presented on social media as being “handed down from ancient Sanskrit” but their more recent origin shouldn’t keep us from learning what we can from them. Here they are:\nYou will receive a body. You may love it or hate it, but it will be yours for the duration of your life on Earth.\nYou will be presented with lessons. You are enrolled in a full-time informal school called ‘life.’ Each day in this school you will have the opportunity to learn lessons. You may like the lessons or hate them, but you have designed them as part of your curriculum.\n\n\n\nThere are no mistakes, only lessons. Growth is a process of experimentation, a series of trials, errors, and occasional victories. The failed experiments are as much a part of the process as the experiments that work.\n\n\n\nA lesson is repeated until learned. Lessons will be repeated to you in various forms until you have learned them. When you have learned them, you can then go on to the next lesson.\n\n\n\nLearning does not end. There is no part of life that does not contain lessons. If you are alive, there are lessons to be learned.\n\n\n\n“There” is no better than “here”. When your “there” has become a “here”, you will simply obtain a “there” that will look better to you than your present “here”.\n\n\n\nOthers are only mirrors of you. You cannot love or hate something about another person unless it reflects something you love or hate about yourself.\n\n\n\nWhat you make of your life is up to you. You have all the tools and resources you need. What you do with them is up to you.\n\n\n\nYour answers lie inside of you. All you need to do is look, listen, and trust.\n\n\n\nYou will forget all of this at birth. You can remember it if you want by unraveling the double helix of inner knowing.\n\nUpdate: Chris Glass had a lovely experience with Carter-Scott’s book recently.\nTags: Cherie Carter-Scott · Chris Glass · lists",

From top to bottom:\nJaime Daniel Fajardo Torres: “This is a species of spider known as ogre spiders, of the genus Deinopis. The photograph was taken at night in the middle of a mature forest in northern Ecuador in the tropical rainforest of the Ecuadorian Chocó, a place considered a hotspot. The spider photographed was generating its egg sac with its own web.”\nHJ Yang: An orca attacks two seals in the morning on the beach.\n\n\n\nJeanny Tang: “The holes dug by fish for spawning can be seen after the pond has dried up.”\n\n(via in focus)\nTags: best of · best of 2023 · photography",

          "description": "The four members of the Beatles, assisted by machine learning technology, come together one last time to record a song together, working off of a demo tape recorded by John Lennon in the 70s.\nThe long mythologised John Lennon demo was first worked on in February 1995 by Paul, George and Ringo as part of The Beatles Anthology project but it remained unfinished, partly because of the impossible technological challenges involved in working with the vocal John had recorded on tape in the 1970s. For years it looked like the song could never be completed.\nBut in 2022 there was a stroke of serendipity. A software system developed by Peter Jackson and his team, used throughout the production of the documentary series Get Back, finally opened the way for the uncoupling of John’s vocal from his piano part. As a result, the original recording could be brought to life and worked on anew with contributions from all four Beatles.\n\n\nHere’s the result, a song called Now and Then:\n\nI enjoyed Ben Lindbergh’s take on the new song and its recording.\nTags: artificial intelligence · Ben Lindbergh · music · Peter Jackson · The Beatles · video",

Tim Berners-Lee famously derided “Web 2.0” as “jargon,” claiming that the web was always intended to be a social and collaborative medium and that the things the proponents of a web renewal wanted to emphasize were there from the start. Which is… basically accurate!\nBut the liberal arts badly needed (and still badly need) an update for the age of the web.

But today is also an important day in my personal history of the web, and I’d argue, in the history of blogging, or at least our corner of it. It’s the twentieth anniversary of Snarkmarket, founded by Robin Sloan and Matt Thompson. It’s also the fifteenth anniversary of the day I joined as the site’s third blogger, or Snarkmaster, after five years of being part of the site’s community (the Snarkmatrix). (Coincidentally, Obama was first elected President that November 4th. It was a really good couple of days.)\nIf you didn’t have the good fortune to read Snarkmarket while it was active, I’ll give you a quick précis.

In keeping with our host’s splendid curatorial style, most of what I’ll post here are not little bloggy essays like this one. But there’s one thing I especially wanted to ask this crowd about.\nFew people would ever have known about Snarkmarket if not for the short video Robin and I made, EPIC 2014 (and then, a year later, 2015), that went viral in an era of the internet in which virality was difficult. To make a video viral in 2004 meant people mirroring a file on their private servers, linking to it on their blogs, and emailing links to friends and colleagues.

          "description": "In the past few decades, we’ve found out a great deal about pre-Columbian civilizations & inhabitants of the Americas, including those in the Amazon rainforest, where settlements were larger and more numerous than previously believed.\nWhen European colonizers arrived in the 16th century, they were captivated by rumors of a golden city, hidden somewhere in the rainforest. Their search for “El Dorado” lasted more than a century, but only resulted in disaster, death, and further conquest of the indigenous people there.\nExperts thereafter looked at the Amazon and saw only a desolate jungle; too harsh for extensive agriculture and therefore sparsely populated. They believed that it had always been this way.\nUntil recently.\nBeginning in the late 20th century, archaeologists began looking more closely at the forest floor. Working with the indigenous people who still remained there, they excavated long ditches and mounds. After mapping them, they could see that these were the markings of large settlements; walls, moats, plazas, and roads that connected even more settlements. And they were all over the Amazon.\n\n\n \nTags: archaeology · video",

Tomorrow (Nov 3) marks the 20th anniversary of Snarkmarket, a quietly influential group blog that featured the writing of Tim Carmody, Matt Thompson, Robin Sloan, and a few other contributors. There hasn’t been much activity over there for several years, but it was a must-read for me back in the day (with a lively comments section) — you may remember the EPIC video that Robin and Matt made (oh, seeing that old design brings back memories!) or Robin’s evergreen classic on stock & flow.\nAnyway, tomorrow Matt, Robin, and Tim are taking over kottke.org to celebrate their anniversary, reminisce about the Good Old Days, and perhaps opine a bit about how people relating to each other online has changed in the 20 years since the formation of the Snarkmatrix. Comments will be on and they’ll be in there mixing it up with you.\nSo then: I hereby declare November 3, 2023 Snarkmarket Day on kottke.org.

          "description": "Using survey data, responses from community boards & city council members, and over 37,000 responses from NYC residents, a team at the NY Times has made a detailed map of the 350+ distinct neighborhoods in NYC. From a companion article:\nIt’s a New York pastime to gripe that neighborhoods are invented and defined by real estate brokers, developers and other city gatekeepers. But the more interesting truth may be that they are also reinvented and reinforced, refracted through race and class, by us: by the air traffic controller who lives in Little Yemen, by the Manhattan community manager who’s sure his constituents live in East Harlem — and not “Upper Carnegie Hill” — and by the Brooklyn residents who decided to name a relatively flat piece of land Boerum Hill.\nA name has power. It can foreshadow who will be moving in. By itself, it can conjure so much: gentrification, displacement, inequality, status. When we argue over names, or even invent new ones, we may be trying to exert some of that power — or lamenting that others have more power than we do.\nWe asked New Yorkers themselves to map their neighborhoods and to tell us what they call them. The result, while imperfect, is probably the most detailed map of the city’s neighborhoods ever compiled.\n\n\nThe article is interesting throughout:\nOur map reveals two main kinds of divisions: sharp ones and fuzzy ones.\nThe fuzzy ones often reflect areas in transition or dispute, where there’s no consensus or where gentrification is rewriting boundaries in real time.\nThe sharp ones often reflect features of the landscape itself: wide avenues, highways, remnants of canals. When you cross the street, you know you’re in another neighborhood.\n\n\nNext time I’m in NYC, I’m definitely going to Little Yemen for lunch.\nTags: cities · language · maps · NYC\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

          "description": "If you look closely at a rainbow made from sunlight (e.g. through a prism or an actual rainbow), you’ll notice that some of the colors are missing. It turns out that these absent colors (called Fraunhofer lines) have something to do with the types of elements that are present in the Sun (and the Earth’s atmosphere). Dr. Joe Hanson explains in the video above.\nOver 200 years ago, scientists were looking at sunlight through a prism when they noticed that part of the rainbow was missing. There were dark lines where there should have been colors. Since then, scientists have unlocked the secrets encoded in these lines, using it to uncover mind-boggling facts about the fundamental nature of our universe and about worlds light-years away.\n\n\nScience is fascinating…Fraunhofer lines can tell us something about objects and processes all along the Powers of Ten scale, from the inner workings of the atom to the composition of the Earth’s atmosphere to how quickly the universe is expanding or contracting.\nIf you’d like to check out the missing parts of the rainbow for yourself, you can make this DIY spectroscope using a CD or DVD and a few other items.

People are sharing their favorite early electric guitar players in the comments of the first video.\nThe series is also available on the subscription-only Nebula — episodes appear there first and the music excerpts are longer because Nebula doesn’t trample all over creators’ fair use rights like YT does.

Kendi (also available as a graphic novel), this documentary explores the mythology of American racism and how it still shapes the world today. The director is Oscar-winner Roger Ross Williams and in preparing for the film, he decided that only Black women would appear in it:\n“When we started looking at historians and scholars, we came up with a long list. I noticed the pattern that most of the people doing the work around racism in America were Black women,” Williams told Netflix. “I asked them in pre-interviews, ‘Why do you do this work?’ And many of them said the same thing — that they had no choice. This was their experience and their life. And if they’re going to dedicate their life to something, it’s going to be about changing and understanding racism in America because they can’t escape racism in America. I said to everyone, ‘We’re going to have only Black women in this film.’ It was an important statement to make.\n\n\nStamped From the Beginning comes out on Netflix on November 20.\nTags: books · Ibram X.

          "description": "There are only a couple of things I like about Halloween: 1. Heidi Klum’s costumes (last year she dressed up as a worm), and 2. the relatively recent Japanese tradition of mundane Halloween costumes. From Spoon & Tamago and Nick Kapur (here too), here are a few of my favorite mundane costumes:\n\n“Factory worker who wore a helmet all day”\n\n“Person who was about to be late for work, but then their train got delayed and now they are taking their time since they got a proof-of-delay ticket from the station”\n\n“Person taking a hearing test at the doctor’s office”\nSee also 2021’s best costumes, including “guy who leans in as his Mario Kart character turns a curve”.\nTags: Halloween · holidays · Japan",

Choir! and they also did a version of this in Dublin with 1000 people singing in tribute:\n\nI’ve previously featured the group singing David Bowie’s Heroes with David Byrne, who said this of the experience:\nWhat happens when one sings together with a lot of other people?\nA couple of things I immediately noticed. There is a transcendent feeling in being subsumed and surrendering to a group. This applies to sports, military drills, dancing… and group singing. One becomes a part of something larger than oneself, and something in our makeup rewards us when that happens. We cling to our individuality, but we experience true ecstasy when we give it up.\n\n\n(via open culture)\nTags: David Byrne · Feist · music · Sinead O’Connor · video\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

          "description": "From 1913 to 1944, amateur mycologist Hans Walty created hundreds of fantastic watercolor illustrations of mushrooms, which are available to peruse in very high-resolution at Wikimedia Commons. There’s not a great deal of information about Walty or his drawings online,1 but I did find this piece from the Swiss National Library. \nHis images depict the colours and shapes of the mushrooms’ fruiting bodies and sometimes also include drawings of microscopic views. The fungi are usually depicted from the side and often from the top and bottom as well. Walty also frequently documented the characteristics of the stems, spores and undersides of the caps. The hobby mycologist also produced an explanatory book to accompany his illustrations that contains descriptions of the mushrooms, with each specimen being assigned a family and genus. His illustrations often contain notes about the time and date the mushroom was found and whether it was edible, inedible or poisonous.\n\n\nWalty’s illustrations were published in multiple editions of a Swiss mushroom guide from the 40s through the 70s. According to the German version of Wikipedia (translated): “For decades, 500 of his illustrations on mushrooms were considered a standard work on mushroom identification, especially in Switzerland.”\nAgain, you can browse through hundreds of Walty’s mushroom illustrations at Wikimedia Commons. (thx, christoph)\n\nNot in English at least; Walty was born in Italy and lived in Germany and Switzerland for much of his life. A biography is available on the German version of Wikipedia. ↩\n\nTags: art · fungi · Hans Walty · mushrooms\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

In 2017, four years after its grand reopening, Amsterdam's Rijksmuseum welcomed its 10-millionth visitor, a man named Stefan Kasper. His lucky timing resulted in getting to spend the night in the museum, where he dined and slept underneath Rembrandt's the Night Watch.\n\nHere's a short video of Kasper's time in the museum:\n\nI still can't believe it. I discovered characters that I have never seen before. They came to life in front of me. It's an experience that is forever etched in my memory.\n\n\nNot the same, but I got to go to a press preview when the MoMA reopened a few years ago after renovations and it was quite an experience to wander those familiar galleries pretty much by myself. I stood in front of Starry Night and One: Number 31, 1950 for a really long time that morning.\nTags: art · museums · Rembrandt · Rijksmuseum · Stefan Kasper · video\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

          "description": "In a piece about how English and North American robins (two unrelated species that don't even share a biological genus or family) got their names, Robert Francis shares how some English birds were given people names...and some of them stuck.\nDuring the 15th century, the English had an endearing practice of granting common human names to the birds that lived among them. Virtually every bird in that era had a name, and most of them, like Will Wagtail and Philip Sparrow have been long forgotten. Polly Parrot has stuck around, and Tom Tit and Jenny Wren, personable companions of the English countryside, are names still sometimes found in children's rhymes. Other human names, however, have been incorporated so durably into the common names that still grace birds as to almost entirely obscure their origin. The Magpie, a loquacious black and white bird with a penchant for snatching shiny objects, once bore the simple name \"pie,\" probably coming from its Roman name, \"pica.\" The English named these birds Margaret, which was then abbreviated to Maggie, and finally left at Mag Pie.[2] The vocal, crow-like bird called Jackdaw was also once just a \"daw\" named \"Jack.\" \nThe English also gave their ubiquitous and beloved orange-bellied, orb-shaped, wren-sized bird a human name. The first recorded Anglo-Saxon name for the Eurasian Robin was ruddoc, meaning \"little red one.\" By the medieval period, its name evolved to redbreast (the more accurate term orange only entered the English language when the fruit of the same name reached Great Britain in the 16th century). The English chose the satisfyingly alliterative name Robert for the redbreast, which they then changed to the popular Tudor nickname Robin. Soon enough, the name Robin Redbreast became so identified with the bird that Redbreast was dropped because it seemed so redundant.\n\n\nI found this list of other people names for birds as well — other examples include jays and martins.

          "description": "I am currently reading1 Lauren Groff's The Vaster Wilds, so I was interested to read about her writing process, which includes:\nWhen Groff starts something new, she writes it out longhand in large spiral notebooks. After she completes a first draft, she puts it in a bankers box — and never reads it again. Then she'll start the book over, still in longhand, working from memory. The idea is that this way, only the best, most vital bits survive.\n\"It's not even the words on the page that accumulate, because I never look at them again, really, but the ideas and the characters start to take on gravity and density,\" she said.\n\"Nothing matters except for these lightning bolts that I've discovered,\" she continued, \"the images that are happening, the sounds that are happening, that feel alive. Those are the only things that really matter from draft to draft.\"\n\n\nAnd also this:\nIn the afternoon, Groff deals with the business of being an author, responding to emails, doing publicity, writing blurbs. And she reads. A lot. In just the past few days, she said, she finished \"Living and Dying With Marcel Proust,\" completed a reread of \"Moby Dick,\" and started a graphic novel called \"Roaming.\" She estimates she reads about 300 books a year.\nGroff will drop quotes into casual conversation, citing, say, Frank Lloyd Wright's take on form and function, but she manages to do this in an entirely unaffected way, just tossing out an interesting nugget for consideration. Her editor, McGrath, said that Groff reread all of Shakespeare so she could write a version of \"The Vaster Wilds\" in iambic pentameter \"just for fun,\" as a way for her to master Elizabethan rhythms.\n\n\nAll of Shakespeare, just for fun. Yep.\n\nOr at least, trying to read. I've been super busy with work and at the end of the day, the last thing I want to do is read more. But I will get back to it!↩\n\nTags: books · Lauren Groff · The Vaster Wilds · writing",

Currently, there's no profile information available for commenters...you can't click on a name to visit their Instagram acct or whatever. That feature is on my to-do list but it might be awhile before I get to it. But I know folks are curious about who reads the site...\nSo, in the meantime, if you feel comfortable sharing, you can use this thread to introduce yourself: maybe where you live, what you're into, your social accounts. I think many of us smartly err on the side of not sharing too many specific details about ourselves online (myself included, but it's obviously complicated 🙃) due to safety issues, but I think it's possible to get to know each other a little bit without spilling too many beans.

I've fixed some of the most egregious bugs and rolled out some tweaks and it seems to be holding up pretty well. 🤞 (Is there a knock-on-wood emoji?)\nIt's early days and I'm rolling things out slowly (only ~10 posts were open for comments this week out of about 50), but commenting activity waned as the week went on. Discovery is still poor (there's no list of open comment threads) and there aren't any notifications — even as an admin user, I have to go to the front page of the site and click into individual threads to see if there's anything new. That's an obvious hinderance to participation and I'm gonna make a first pass at fixing it next week.\nI also recognize that it's …",

          "description": "The influential Whole Earth Catalog, along with a number of related publications, has been uploaded to The Internet Archive and is now available online for free at the Whole Earth Index. From Wired:\nThe Whole Earth Catalog was the proto-blog — a collection of reviews, how-to guides, and primers on anarchic libertarianism printed onto densely packed pages. It carried the tagline \"Access to Tools\" and offered know-how, product reviews, cultural analysis, and gobs of snark, long before you could get all that on the internet.\nAt the time of its initial publication in the late 1960s, the periodical became a beacon for techno-optimists and back-to-the-land hippies. The Whole Earth Catalog preached self-reliance, teaching young baby boomers how to build their own cabins, garden sheds, and geodesic domes after they had turned on, tuned in, and dropped out — well before they grew wealthy enough to buy up all the three-bedroom single-family homes. The catalog also had a profound impact on Silicon Valley's ethos, and is credited with seeding the ideas that helped fuel today's startup culture.\n\n\n \nTags: The Whole Earth Catalog",

In this video, which has only recently been made public, you can see Byrne practicing his now-iconic moves.\n40 years ago, David Byrne rehearsed dances for Talking Heads' upcoming Speaking in Tongues tour by recording video of himself to determine which moves worked better than others, which developed into many of the iconic moves seen in the Stop Making Sense movie, filmed at the end of 1983 and released in 1984. It was recently rereleased by A24 in restored 4K. These videos, recorded in David Byrne's loft, have been mentioned before in interviews and now after 40 years the footage is finally available!\n\n\nIf you don't want to sit through the full 25-minute video, here's an hors d'oeuvres version:\n\n(via open culture)\nTags: dance · David Byrne · movies · music · Stop Making Sense · Talking Heads · video\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

Wistful talk of \"real America\" aside, Conn, who teaches at Miami University, in Oxford, Ohio, argues that the rural United States is, in fact, highly artificial. Its inhabitants are as much creatures of state power and industrial capitalism as their city-dwelling counterparts. But we rarely acknowledge this, Conn writes, because many of us — urban and rural, on the left and the right — \"don't quite want it to be true.…",

Club has taken on the task of ranking the best 50 music videos, from the first video ever played on MTV (Video Killed the Radio Star by The Buggles, featuring none other than soundtrack composer Hans Zimmer on keys) to Thriller, Sabotage, Addicted to Love, and Sledgehammer. You can watch the whole list via this playlist on YouTube.\n\nI loved the video for Sledgehammer. I was 12 years old the summer it came out. We didn't have cable TV then, but I'd turn on MTV anywhere I could, hoping for a glimpse of it. My dad used to take my sister and me on roadtrips all over the country and I vividly remember the rare times we got to stay in a motel (they had to have a swimming pool with a diving board), turning on MTV, and catching that Sledgehammer video a few times every hour.

They'll also help out Mama-san by serving other customers as well. [...] Bottle keep is when a customer buys a bottle and the shop holds on to it for them. Then the next time they visit they can drink from that bottle again.\n\n\nI've got lots of thoughts about this and connections to make!

Recently, an avid whale watcher and good friend, Buddy, died. One of Buddy's wishes was that Tom spread his ashes on the ocean he loved so much.\nSo, on a beautiful summer evening, Tom canceled his usual nightly cruise and organized a private memorial service. More than 80 of Buddy's friends and family members came to say a last goodbye.\nA serious-looking young woman who sat quietly by herself was among the passengers. None of the other people, including the crew members, knew who she was.\n\n\nI won't spoil the ending...you'll have to click through to read.\nI've never been to any memorial services at sea, but I did go whale watching in Alaska once. The extremely salty captain of the boat had two prosthetic hands with hooks on them (as Tom Nash demonstrates in this video). After we got underway, he left his first mate in charge and came out on the windy deck, got a cigarette and a matchbook out of his shirt pocket, tore off a match, and, with a single try, lit the cigarette. In, like, whipping 20 mph winds with the boat heaving in the waves. He was standing right in front of me when as he did it and it remains one of the most physically impressive things I have ever seen a person do. The man was so perfectly in his element that it was almost magical.",

We've been at them before.\nShe shows how this moment is part of an ongoing struggle between a small group of white people who think that America was founded on principles of white supremacy and should remain that way, and the rest of us.\n\n\nThroughout US history, the white supremacists have seized power and implemented minority rule: secession, Jim Crow & anti-immigration laws. Then the majority pushes back: the Civil War & Reconstruction, The New Deal.\nThe current GOP is a backlash against Brown v Board of Education (the Supreme Court case that declared racial segregation in schools unconstitutional.)\nRichardson traces in detail how that backlash happened, and how today's backlash echoes the language and attitudes of the Confederacy.\nShe shows Nixon and others tied taxes to \"redistributing wealth\" to \"undeserving\" people as a way to get lower income racists aboard an economic agenda that hurt them.\n\n\nI really have to make time to read this book!\nTags: books · Democracy Awakening · Heather Cox Richardson · politics · racism · Teri Kanefield · USA",

(Content warning: this article lists many violent acts, none of which are performed.)\nAt precisely 9 in the morning, working with focus and stealth, our entire membership succeeded in simultaneously beheading no one. At 10, Phase II began, during which our entire membership did not force a single man to suck another man's penis. Also, none of us blew himself/herself up in a crowded public place. No civilians were literally turned inside out via our powerful explosives. In addition, at 11, in Phase III, zero (0) planes were flown into buildings.\nDuring Phase IV, just after lunch, we were able to avoid bulldozing a single home. Furthermore, we set, on roads in every city, in every nation in the world, a total of zero (0) roadside bombs which, not being there, did not subsequently explode, killing/maiming a total of nobody. No bombs were dropped, during the lazy afternoon hours, on crowded civilian neighborhoods, from which, it was observed, no post-bomb momentary silences were then heard. These silences were, in all cases, followed by no unimaginable, grief-stricken bellows of rage, and/or frantic imprecations to a deity. No sleeping baby was awakened from an afternoon nap by the sudden collapse and/or bursting into flame of his/her domicile during Phase IV.\n\n\nIt's a timely reminder of the overwhelming huge number of people in the world who are not militant extremists — but also of the power held by the tiny minority that are.\nTags: George Saunders · politics · terrorism · war",

          "description": "Hey all. I'm going to be launching a new thing here soon (more on that in a few days), but you may have already noticed some changes around here. Design tweaks mostly. What you don't see is that I pretty much ripped out the main guts of the site and rewrote a key piece of it...painful but necessary for some upcoming features. Hooooopefully it's all working properly, but let me know if you see anything amiss? Especially with the membership stuff?\nAnyway, one of the changes that people using RSS/newsreaders to read the site will have noticed is that the Quick Links are no longer bundled up into a few digests/day...they now arrive as they're posted, one at a time. So if you got a bunch of old Quick Links clogging up your feedreader this morning, sorry about that — it should be a one-time thing.\nAlso regarding the RSS feed: the QL RSS items do not have titles (they are optional IIRC) and I'm getting a glimpse of the ways in which various newsreaders, uh, deal with title-less items. 😬 I've tested Feedly and Feedbin, but if you use another newsreader, would you mind emailing me a screenshot of how it handles these title-less Quick Links? Thanks!\nUpdate: Ok, I've got FreshRSS, Newsblur, Unread, Reeder, NetNewsWire, Newsify, Newsboat, Inoreader, The Old Reader, Tiny Tiny RSS, Vienna, and a few others.

          "description": "You may have previously read about the Citicorp Center. Joe Morgenstern wrote about the Manhattan skyscraper in a classic New Yorker piece from 1995. The building was built incorrectly and might have blown over in a stiff wind if not for a timely intervention on the part of a mystery architecture student and the head structural engineer on the project.\nTells about designer William J. LeMessurier, who was structural consultant to the architect Hugh Stubbins, Jr. They set their 59-story tower on four massive nine-story-high stilts and used an unusual, chevron-shaped system of wind braces. LeMessurier had established the strength of those braces in perpendicular winds. Now, in the spirit of intellectual play, in his Harvard class, he wanted to see if they were just as strong in winds hitting from 45 degrees. He discovered the design flaw and during wind tunnel tests in Ontario learned the weakest joint was at the building's 30th floor.\n\n\t\nThe whole piece is here and well worth a read. Last month, the excellent 99% Invisible did a radio show about Citicorp Center and added a new bit of information to the story: the identity of the mystery student who prodded LeMessurier to think more deeply about the structural integrity of his building.

This video is 45 minutes long and during that time, a photon emitted from the Sun1 will only travel through a portion of our solar system.\n\nIn our terrestrial view of things, the speed of light seems incredibly fast. But as soon as you view it against the vast distances of the universe, it's unfortunately very slow. This animation illustrates, in realtime, the journey of a photon of light emitted from the sun and traveling across a portion of the solar system.\n\n\t\nIt takes light more than 43 minutes to travel to Jupiter and even to travel the diameter of the Sun takes 4.6 seconds. (thx, andy)\nTo even fight its way out of the Sun is an incredible journey for a photon. The Sun is so dense that a photon generated at the core is absorbed and re-emitted trillions of times by hydrogen nuclei on its way out. By some estimates, it may take up to 40,000 years for a photon to escape the Sun's surface and head on out to the cold reaches of space.↩\n[This was originally posted on February  3, 2015.]\nTags:astronomy    \nphysics    \nscience    \nvideo",

          "description": "Amazon has a bunch of stuff on sale today & tomorrow for an \"event\" they're calling Prime Big Deal Days. I'm not going to do a big roundup here, but here are a few things you might be interested in if you're an Amazon shopper:\nApple AirPods Pro (2nd Gen) with Lightning connector for $189 (24% off). This is the lowest price I've seen on these; they're the best headphones I've ever owned. Apple just released a newer version of these (nearly the same product except for a USB-C connector on the case) and the low price is probably to clear out inventory. Both versions charge just fine with a MagSafe or Qi-certified charger, so why not get the cheaper one if you charge that way and don't care about the small differences? Update: Both versions are the same price (I don't think they were this morning). So get the newer ones!\nApple 2020 MacBook Air Laptop M1 for $750 (25% off). This is my laptop. I love this laptop. When my daughter needed a new computer for high school, I bought her one of these.\n\n\n\nAmazon Kindle Paperwhite for $95 (32% off). I read all my books on this. Lightweight and the battery lasts forever. And it charges with USB-3 so that's one less cable to haul around.\n\n\n\nSAF Aranet4 Home CO2 Monitor for $159 (36% off). This is everyone's pick for the best indoor air quality monitor.\n\n\n\nSplendor Board Game for $20.49 (54% off). This has been a recent hit around our house...very easy to play but still difficult to master.\n\n\n\nKitchenAid 3.5 Qt. Stand Mixer for $260 (32% off). This is KitchenAid's smaller stand mixer, which is lighter and takes up less counter space in smaller kitchens.\n\nYou can find more deals on the Prime Big Deal Days page.\nWhen you buy through links on kottke.org, I may earn an affiliate commission.

The latest installment in the legendary series, 17 years after the first one was released, will once again be presented by Sir David Attenborough, now 97 years old and still as enthusiastic about sharing the wonders of nature as he ever was.\n'The opening of the series with David was filmed in the beautiful British countryside in exactly the location where Charles Darwin used to walk whilst thinking-over his Earth-shaking ideas about evolution. It seemed the perfect place for David to introduce Planet Earth III and remind us of both the wonders and the fragility of our planet. ....and for him, of course, the sun shined under blue skies one of the only days it did all summer!.'\n\n\nThe video above is a quick first look at the series and here's a trailer as well:\n\nLooking forward to this...the Planet Earth series is still the gold standard for nature documentaries.\nTags: David Attenborough · Planet Earth · trailers · TV · video",
