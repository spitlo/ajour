Check out her tattoo art.\nDevine's Strange Loop 2023 talk was released online, watch it here(YouTube). We also released the talk as a text version, Computing and sustainability, for those who prefer to read. We talked with the members of Frugarilla on their latest podcast(French), in which we finally admit that our whole thing is a sneaky way of getting programmers interested in food preservation.\nEvery year we carve halloween pumpkins, this year we made a Uxn pumpkin!\nSee Oquonie running on a linux handheld(Mastodon).\nPino book club\nWe are reading Selma Lagerlöf's The Wonderful Adventures of Nils.\nContinue Reading",

We had a lovely sail that day, with clear skies, and 10 kts on the beam. Despite being a little food and sleep deprived, Devine's presentation went well, we will share the recording here once it is released.\nRek has been busy editing Wiktopher, finessing the conlangs featured in the story. One of the featured languages is Ilken, a whistled language, designed for long-distance communication, and playable with instruments. A few years ago Devine designed a language for it, but we decided to instead use a modern variation of Solresol, a musical language by Jean-François Sudre. Rek drew a fanart of the mascot of Solresol, and Devine a communication lantern.\nCurrently, Devine is working at translating Thousand Rooms(Famimi Remisolla) in Solresol as practice. We're also editing a Brazilian Portuguese version, to be released next month.\nWe've been toying with the idea of making an audiobook for the story, and asked Paul B. to use their voice synthesis tool Gesture to try and hear what a poem in Ilken(Solresol) sounds like. The result was so lovely that it made Rek cry of joy.\nRek's sketch thread(Mastodon) is still going. Devine will be producing a lot more art next month for Drawtober!\nPino book club\nWe are reading J.D. Salinger's Catcher in the Rye, and B. F. Skinner's Walden Two.\nContinue Reading",

Definitely!\nI'd not fixed a Kindle before, but my guess was the USB port was probably at fault. Inspecting it under the microscope (and looking at the mouth of the port) I could see it was definitely the problem. It's understandable that a young child isn't always going to connect the USB cable cleanly and the port had eventually given up the ghost.\nOpening the Kindle Fire is the process of unclipping the edge - there's no screws on the outside. Once open, the main board can be lifted off, on the reverse side (to my photos) is a ribbon cable that can't be disconnected right next to the USB port.\nUsing a hot air gun and lots of constant movement, I was able to free the USB port without melting the ribbon cable or the FPC connector (which is entirely plastic). By keeping the airflow moving it protects plastics from heating up but allows the solder to melt, but it takes practise and a careful hand.\nOnce free, I had a replacement from eBay and once re-installed the Kindle Fire charged up just like old times.\nOne more bit of tech saved from landfill 💪",

          "description": "On the Console Repair Discord I'd offered to fix a Pokémon Sapphire cart that was initially not working, but then went to a repair shop and came back with a leg on one of the chips missing.\nThe work would require grinding down the silicone of the chip to expose the internals of the missing leg and jump it to the solder pad. The cart was also missing a resistor and capacitor.\nI decided to start by completely removing the chips from the board, and I'm glad I did because underneath I found a lot of corrosion and junk from either time or previous attempts. The solder joints also looked dull which suggested to me that it would benefit from a reflow.\nOnce this was done, the board was cleaned (thankfully there was no trace repair required), I replaced the chips and went about grinding the ROM chip to expose the broken leg.\n\nOnce exposed, I created a jumper using solder to the pad, installed a few missing components (a capacitor and resistor had been lost previously) and it was all back to life.",

          "description": "Cutting to the chase: text editors *and* tabs vs. spaces!  Ooooh!\n\n\nI've had this thing called \"e\" for a while now.  It's a stupid little \nscript which serves to do a couple of things.  It starts my \neditor\nwith a given file, and it kicks it with the right arguments to make it \ndisable line wrapping and to make the [TAB] key actually put in two \nspaces.\n\n\nSo, my dumb script would use \"-w -E -T 2\" most of the time, except when it \nwas running on a Makefile, at which point it would skip those args.  \nSimple enough, right?\n\n\npico is back?  Yes indeed, on Macs, as of 12.3, pico is in fact back.  To \nmake sure I wasn't imagining things, I tracked down a machine that hadn't \nbeen upgraded yet and checked there.  Sure enough, it was in fact nano and \nnot pico.\n\n\nmacOS 12.3 has nano as a symlink... pointing to pico!\n\n\nAt some point, I switched from literal tab characters in my source code to \nblobs of spaces, probably due to using that style at work and not hating \nit.  So, somewhere along the line I actually started depending on nano \nbehavior without realizing it.\n\n\nAs for the lack of a feature in pico itself, it's kind of strange, really.  \nIf you go digging into the source, they have this random.c with a function \ncalled tab which claims to \"simulate tab stop\" using spaces.  That said, I \ncan't find any place where it would be called with the magic values which \nwould make it behave that way.\n\n\nIt wouldn't surprise me if this switch is just more of Apple removing \nGPLed things from their OS - pico seems to use the Apache license.  They \ndumped bash for zsh (MIT license) at some point (Big Sur, I think), and \nnow this?  Okay then.",

          "description": "Here's a very old and stupid trick you could do with some filesystems in \nsome situations back in the day... and might still be able to do in a \nfew places today.\n\n\nThe problem is that while version X might eventually have an exploit, \nit'll get removed and it'll be replaced by version Y without that\nparticular hole.  By the time you get your hands on a tool to break into \nX, it'll be gone.\n\n\nWhat you'd do is create a hard link pointing at the file you wanted to \npreserve, storing it in a spot which was writable by your account.  \nThen, say, /usr/bin/sudo (because that never has security \nissues...) gets replaced at some point with a new file and you get to \nkeep the old version.  When you get the tool to pop it, off you go!\n\n\nOf course, these days, it's not quite so easy on the more modern systems \nyou find.  Debian 11 here won't let me do it - it's EPERM city.  Rocky 8 \n(so CentOS 8 and RHEL 8 too) also won't do it.  They both have some gunk\nin /usr/lib/sysctl.d to lock this down.  But, my old Slackware 14.2 \ninstall of my workstation let me do it the last time I tried about \na year ago.  How about that, huh?  I bet it'd still work if I dug out \nthe old drives and booted them up.\n\n\nIncidentally, this is the magic sauce: /proc/sys/fs/protected_hardlinks\nRead the man page for proc(5) to learn more about it.\n\nhere it is,\nthe thread I read a long time ago.  It's interesting to note that as far \nas I can tell, nothing actually changed upstream.  This left paranoid \nadmins like me with no option but to use the (most excellent) Openwall \npatches to lock down this kind of stuff.  I used that on my machines at \nwork which had non-staff users... just in case.\n\n\nThis whole situation is scary.  \nRead more about it.",

          "description": "One of the fun things I used to do at a prior job was to dig through the \nraw data points which were collected from the *many* servers we had.  I \ncould just pick an interesting-sounding metric and then would just ask \nthe system to show me the top 10 or bottom 10 out of a population of \nthousands or more.\n\n\nTo get my feet wet with the whole \"investigations\" thing that we'd do, I \nstarted looking into this one day and chose one of the many temp sensors \nwhich were being logged by the servers.  I forget exactly which one it \nwas, for there were many.  The CPUs logged it, the chassis logged it, \nthe power supply logged it, and so on.  There were so many choices.\n\n\nI went looking for a reason.  What could possibly explain this?  First \noff, it didn't line up with any obvious pattern in the host names.  The \nhosts were named for whichever team owned them, followed by a sequence \nnumber that was bumped any time a new one was provisioned.  There was no \nsignal to be found in that.\n\n\nThere was more, though.  You could also see a \"rack position\" in this \ndata, and now it started getting interesting.  It seems that all of the \nreally hot machines had a rack position of something low, like 04 or 05, \nand never anything higher than that.  In fact, when looking at a whole \nrack, it was always the lowest number of all of the positions that were \nbeing used.  Now this was worth chasing!\n\n\nIt's good that I asked, since they told me something surprising: \nposition 04 or 05 or whatever was the *bottom* of the rack.  Yes, \nsomehow, the lowest machine in the rack was the hottest!  They found \nthis interesting, too, and wound up digging into it.  Given that I was \nfar away in a distant office, this was the best way for us to proceed.\n\n\nThe problem was that the bottommost server would have nothing below it \nbut just open space until it got to the floor.  That space would not \nmove air efficiently, and it obviously mattered.\n\n\nThis rolled out and my hot spots disappeared.  Fantastic!",

In short, it looks like every Raspberry Pi filesystem installed \nfrom any given release image probably ends up with the same\nUUID.\n\n\nFor instance, if you downloaded the \"lite\" version of Raspbian between \nroughly November 8th and January 28th, you probably got a file called \n2021-10-30-raspios-bullseye-armhf-lite.zip.  Inside, there's an image, \nand the idea is that you dump that straight to your SD card, cram it in \nthe Pi, and off you go.  The second partition on that image is an ext4 \nfilesystem which was created on some build machine somewhere.  The UUID \non it never gets \"evolved\" to something else after the install.\n\n\nYou can see it inside the image itself here:\n\n\nOr, if you actually installed a few of these things like I did over the \npast couple of months, you can just 'tune2fs -l /dev/mmcblk0p2' and see \nthe same value in there.\n\n\nDon't end up with a pile of SD cards on your desk and think \"I know, \nI'll use the filesystem UUIDs to track which one goes where\", in other \nwords.\n\n\nIf it's not breaking anything for you, it's probably best to just let it \nbe.  Untangling a boot mess on these weird little boxes is anything but \nfun.\n\nNote: if you're actually on a recent Raspberry Pi, odds are good that \nyour /etc/fstab will be using *partition* UUIDs (PARTUUID=...) and not \nthose of the filesystem.  If in doubt, use blkid to see what's what.",

The House of the Future will bring the Human Power Plant’s “Human Powered Neighbourhood” scenario to life in Bospolder-Tussendijken, Rotterdam, in the coming years. You can already get a taste of it at the Museum Boijmans van Beuningen’s online exhibition (in Dutch).\nSince this community will run largely on human power, we need human power plants. Therefore, Kris De Decker and Marie Verdeil organise an open and collaborative workshop where we will build a fully working bicycle generator based on a second-hand spinning bike. You are welcome to learn, experiment, teach, and help.\nDuring the workshop, we will mount a generator on the bike, build a control panel, and modify devices to run on low voltage. This bicycle generator will be specifically designed to serve as a power source in the communal workshop, so that we can use it to build more stuff we need (including more bike generators).\nProgramme:\nTuesday 10 October (14h-18h): open day House of the Future\nWednesday 11 October (15h-17h): introduction workshop\nThursday 12 October (10h-17h): workshop\nFriday, October 13 (14h-19h): workshop\nSaturday, October 14 (14h-17h): workshop\nWe speak Dutch, English, French, and Spanish. The introduction (11 oct) will be in Dutch only.\nAdmission is free. To participate: just walk in (Jan Kobellstraat 56A, Rotterdam) or send an email to contact [] huisvandetoekomst [] org.\nAll future events will be published on our events page.\n\n\n Illustration: Future vision of the human powered housing block in Rotterdam.

However, our transport networks are very wasteful of energy and utterly dependent on fossil fuels. In this series of articles, Low-tech Magazine critically examines the call for electrified vehicles, which depend on unsustainable batteries and infrastructures.\nMuch more important than the chosen power source is vehicle design: size, weight, speed, acceleration, and comfort level. Furthermore, public transport is more resource efficient, and we could electrify it without batteries.\nThe book’s second part deals with long-distance transportation: planes, trains, sailing ships, and ocean liners. By placing transportation technology in a historical context, Low-tech Magazine challenges our high-tech approach to sustainability and highlights the possibilities of alternative solutions.\nContents table:\nHow to Downsize a Transport Network: the Chinese Wheelbarrow\nThe Citroën 2CV: Cleantech from the 1940s\nThe Status Quo of Electric Cars: Better Batteries, Same Range\nElectric Velomobiles: as Fast and Comfortable as Automobiles, but 80 times more Efficient\nGet Wired again: Trolleybuses and Trolleytrucks\nHigh Speed Trains are Killing the European Railway Network\nLife Without Airplanes: from London to New York in 3 Days and 12 Hours\nHow to Design a Sailing Ship for the 21st Century?\nHow to downsize a transport network?, Kris De Decker, 166 pages, Low-tech Magazine, 2023.\nOther thematic books in the series:\nHow to build a low-tech internet?, Kris De Decker, 162 pages, Low-tech Magazine, 2023.\nThe Low-tech Magazine archives are also available as a chronological series consisting of three volumes.\nPatrons get early access to new books at a reduced price.",

          "description": "erikkwakkel:\nMedieval dachshund - Or: drawing with words\nHere are three examples of a technique called “micrography”: decorative scenes that are drawn with words written in a tiny script. While there are examples from Latin books made in the West (here is one), the technique is particularly common in medieval Hebrew manuscripts. The drawings are usually found in biblical manuscripts and they appear to be commentaries to the text. The technique, whereby a scribe wrote in the smallest handwriting possible, goes back to the 9th century AD. The examples here, from the 13th century, shows just how entertaining the word-made drawings can be: they are an opportunity for the scribe to frolick in the margins of the page - like drawing a creature that looks like a dachshund.\nPic: London, British Library, Additional MS 21160 (13th century, more about the manuscript here).

          "description": "Nearly everything about Fortnite’s popular Battle Royale mode is geared towards creating conflict between its players. In this episode of Pop Culture Detective, Jonathan McIntosh explores whether you can be a pacifist in a virtual world filled with war and, beyond that, whether you can make friends with your fiercest enemy. As a Fortnite player who has qualms about even the cartoony violence in the game, I loved this video. It reminded me of Robin Sloan’s piece in the Atlantic from 2018: I Played Fortnite and Figured Out the Universe.\nWhen they’re successful, these negotiations are honestly more nervy and exciting than the game’s most intense shoot-outs. I’m not the only one who thinks so. In forums dedicated to Fortnite Battle Royale, some players share clips of chance alliances, and others reply glumly: “Super rare to find someone [who] won’t shoot you when you emote.” I dream of a Political Fortnite in which victory goes not to the twitchiest sniper but the most charismatic organizer, with factions forming and dissolving… I imagine the fear and thrill of seeing not one but a dozen tiny silhouettes on the far ridge-a war band sweeping fast down the hillside. I’m outnumbered; can I convince them to let me join them?\n\n\n(thx, andy)\nTags: Fortnite · Jonathan McIntosh · video · video games\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

Unless you went to camp as a kid or have spent a bunch of time outdoors, at least some of these techniques will be new to you. I’d never heard of trees growing in a check mark shape. From natural navigation expert Tristan Gooley:\nObviously, all green plants need sunlight. So it’s logical that plants will, all things being equal, tend to grow more abundantly on the side the light comes from. In the northern parts of the world, where the sun is due south in the middle of the day, that means plants are growing more abundantly on the south side.\nTry noticing this in a tree the next time you take a walk outside. You should see that there’s more tree on the south side, unless there are other factors-for instance there are amazing examples of glass buildings that can make trees grow the wrong way. But generally speaking, there should be more of the tree on the south side.\n\n\nGooley is the author of The Lost Art of Reading Nature’s Signs: Use Outdoor Clues to Find Your Way, Predict the Weather, Locate Water, Track Animals — and Other Forgotten Skills and several related books.

          "description": "A few decades ago, Chérie Carter-Scott devised a list of 10 Rules for Being Human, which was published in her 1998 book If Life Is a Game, These Are the Rules. These rules are often presented on social media as being “handed down from ancient Sanskrit” but their more recent origin shouldn’t keep us from learning what we can from them. Here they are:\nYou will receive a body. You may love it or hate it, but it will be yours for the duration of your life on Earth.\nYou will be presented with lessons. You are enrolled in a full-time informal school called ‘life.’ Each day in this school you will have the opportunity to learn lessons. You may like the lessons or hate them, but you have designed them as part of your curriculum.\n\n\n\nThere are no mistakes, only lessons. Growth is a process of experimentation, a series of trials, errors, and occasional victories. The failed experiments are as much a part of the process as the experiments that work.\n\n\n\nA lesson is repeated until learned. Lessons will be repeated to you in various forms until you have learned them. When you have learned them, you can then go on to the next lesson.\n\n\n\nLearning does not end. There is no part of life that does not contain lessons. If you are alive, there are lessons to be learned.\n\n\n\n“There” is no better than “here”. When your “there” has become a “here”, you will simply obtain a “there” that will look better to you than your present “here”.\n\n\n\nOthers are only mirrors of you. You cannot love or hate something about another person unless it reflects something you love or hate about yourself.\n\n\n\nWhat you make of your life is up to you. You have all the tools and resources you need. What you do with them is up to you.\n\n\n\nYour answers lie inside of you. All you need to do is look, listen, and trust.\n\n\n\nYou will forget all of this at birth. You can remember it if you want by unraveling the double helix of inner knowing.\n\nUpdate: Chris Glass had a lovely experience with Carter-Scott’s book recently.\nTags: Cherie Carter-Scott · Chris Glass · lists",

The photograph was taken at night in the middle of a mature forest in northern Ecuador in the tropical rainforest of the Ecuadorian Chocó, a place considered a hotspot. The spider photographed was generating its egg sac with its own web.”\nHJ Yang: An orca attacks two seals in the morning on the beach.\n\n\n\nJeanny Tang: “The holes dug by fish for spawning can be seen after the pond has dried up.”\n\n(via in focus)\nTags: best of · best of 2023 · photography",

          "description": "The four members of the Beatles, assisted by machine learning technology, come together one last time to record a song together, working off of a demo tape recorded by John Lennon in the 70s.\nThe long mythologised John Lennon demo was first worked on in February 1995 by Paul, George and Ringo as part of The Beatles Anthology project but it remained unfinished, partly because of the impossible technological challenges involved in working with the vocal John had recorded on tape in the 1970s. For years it looked like the song could never be completed.\nBut in 2022 there was a stroke of serendipity. A software system developed by Peter Jackson and his team, used throughout the production of the documentary series Get Back, finally opened the way for the uncoupling of John’s vocal from his piano part. As a result, the original recording could be brought to life and worked on anew with contributions from all four Beatles.\n\n\nHere’s the result, a song called Now and Then:\n\nI enjoyed Ben Lindbergh’s take on the new song and its recording.\nTags: artificial intelligence · Ben Lindbergh · music · Peter Jackson · The Beatles · video",

Tim Berners-Lee famously derided “Web 2.0” as “jargon,” claiming that the web was always intended to be a social and collaborative medium and that the things the proponents of a web renewal wanted to emphasize were there from the start. Which is… basically accurate!\nBut the liberal arts badly needed (and still badly need) an update for the age of the web.

It’s the twentieth anniversary of Snarkmarket, founded by Robin Sloan and Matt Thompson. It’s also the fifteenth anniversary of the day I joined as the site’s third blogger, or Snarkmaster, after five years of being part of the site’s community (the Snarkmatrix). (Coincidentally, Obama was first elected President that November 4th. It was a really good couple of days.)\nIf you didn’t have the good fortune to read Snarkmarket while it was active, I’ll give you a quick précis.

But there’s one thing I especially wanted to ask this crowd about.\nFew people would ever have known about Snarkmarket if not for the short video Robin and I made, EPIC 2014 (and then, a year later, 2015), that went viral in an era of the internet in which virality was difficult.

          "description": "In the past few decades, we’ve found out a great deal about pre-Columbian civilizations & inhabitants of the Americas, including those in the Amazon rainforest, where settlements were larger and more numerous than previously believed.\nWhen European colonizers arrived in the 16th century, they were captivated by rumors of a golden city, hidden somewhere in the rainforest. Their search for “El Dorado” lasted more than a century, but only resulted in disaster, death, and further conquest of the indigenous people there.\nExperts thereafter looked at the Amazon and saw only a desolate jungle; too harsh for extensive agriculture and therefore sparsely populated. They believed that it had always been this way.\nUntil recently.\nBeginning in the late 20th century, archaeologists began looking more closely at the forest floor. Working with the indigenous people who still remained there, they excavated long ditches and mounds. After mapping them, they could see that these were the markings of large settlements; walls, moats, plazas, and roads that connected even more settlements. And they were all over the Amazon.\n\n\n \nTags: archaeology · video",

Tomorrow (Nov 3) marks the 20th anniversary of Snarkmarket, a quietly influential group blog that featured the writing of Tim Carmody, Matt Thompson, Robin Sloan, and a few other contributors. There hasn’t been much activity over there for several years, but it was a must-read for me back in the day (with a lively comments section) — you may remember the EPIC video that Robin and Matt made (oh, seeing that old design brings back memories!) or Robin’s evergreen classic on stock & flow.\nAnyway, tomorrow Matt, Robin, and Tim are taking over kottke.org to celebrate their anniversary, reminisce about the Good Old Days, and perhaps opine a bit about how people relating to each other online has changed in the 20 years since the formation of the Snarkmatrix. Comments will be on and they’ll be in there mixing it up with you.\nSo then: I hereby declare November 3, 2023 Snarkmarket Day on kottke.org.

          "description": "Using survey data, responses from community boards & city council members, and over 37,000 responses from NYC residents, a team at the NY Times has made a detailed map of the 350+ distinct neighborhoods in NYC. From a companion article:\nIt’s a New York pastime to gripe that neighborhoods are invented and defined by real estate brokers, developers and other city gatekeepers. But the more interesting truth may be that they are also reinvented and reinforced, refracted through race and class, by us: by the air traffic controller who lives in Little Yemen, by the Manhattan community manager who’s sure his constituents live in East Harlem — and not “Upper Carnegie Hill” — and by the Brooklyn residents who decided to name a relatively flat piece of land Boerum Hill.\nA name has power. It can foreshadow who will be moving in. By itself, it can conjure so much: gentrification, displacement, inequality, status. When we argue over names, or even invent new ones, we may be trying to exert some of that power — or lamenting that others have more power than we do.\nWe asked New Yorkers themselves to map their neighborhoods and to tell us what they call them. The result, while imperfect, is probably the most detailed map of the city’s neighborhoods ever compiled.\n\n\nThe article is interesting throughout:\nOur map reveals two main kinds of divisions: sharp ones and fuzzy ones.\nThe fuzzy ones often reflect areas in transition or dispute, where there’s no consensus or where gentrification is rewriting boundaries in real time.\nThe sharp ones often reflect features of the landscape itself: wide avenues, highways, remnants of canals. When you cross the street, you know you’re in another neighborhood.\n\n\nNext time I’m in NYC, I’m definitely going to Little Yemen for lunch.\nTags: cities · language · maps · NYC\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

          "description": "If you look closely at a rainbow made from sunlight (e.g. through a prism or an actual rainbow), you’ll notice that some of the colors are missing. It turns out that these absent colors (called Fraunhofer lines) have something to do with the types of elements that are present in the Sun (and the Earth’s atmosphere). Dr. Joe Hanson explains in the video above.\nOver 200 years ago, scientists were looking at sunlight through a prism when they noticed that part of the rainbow was missing. There were dark lines where there should have been colors. Since then, scientists have unlocked the secrets encoded in these lines, using it to uncover mind-boggling facts about the fundamental nature of our universe and about worlds light-years away.\n\n\nScience is fascinating…Fraunhofer lines can tell us something about objects and processes all along the Powers of Ten scale, from the inner workings of the atom to the composition of the Earth’s atmosphere to how quickly the universe is expanding or contracting.\nIf you’d like to check out the missing parts of the rainbow for yourself, you can make this DIY spectroscope using a CD or DVD and a few other items.

People are sharing their favorite early electric guitar players in the comments of the first video.\nThe series is also available on the subscription-only Nebula — episodes appear there first and the music excerpts are longer because Nebula doesn’t trample all over creators’ fair use rights like YT does.

Kendi (also available as a graphic novel), this documentary explores the mythology of American racism and how it still shapes the world today. The director is Oscar-winner Roger Ross Williams and in preparing for the film, he decided that only Black women would appear in it:\n“When we started looking at historians and scholars, we came up with a long list. I noticed the pattern that most of the people doing the work around racism in America were Black women,” Williams told Netflix. “I asked them in pre-interviews, ‘Why do you do this work?’ And many of them said the same thing — that they had no choice. This was their experience and their life. And if they’re going to dedicate their life to something, it’s going to be about changing and understanding racism in America because they can’t escape racism in America. I said to everyone, ‘We’re going to have only Black women in this film.’ It was an important statement to make.\n\n\nStamped From the Beginning comes out on Netflix on November 20.\nTags: books · Ibram X.

Heidi Klum’s costumes (last year she dressed up as a worm), and 2. the relatively recent Japanese tradition of mundane Halloween costumes. From Spoon & Tamago and Nick Kapur (here too), here are a few of my favorite mundane costumes:\n\n“Factory worker who wore a helmet all day”\n\n“Person who was about to be late for work, but then their train got delayed and now they are taking their time since they got a proof-of-delay ticket from the station”\n\n“Person taking a hearing test at the doctor’s office”\nSee also 2021’s best costumes, including “guy who leans in as his Mario Kart character turns a curve”.\nTags: Halloween · holidays · Japan",

There is a transcendent feeling in being subsumed and surrendering to a group. This applies to sports, military drills, dancing… and group singing. One becomes a part of something larger than oneself, and something in our makeup rewards us when that happens. We cling to our individuality, but we experience true ecstasy when we give it up.\n\n\n(via open culture)\nTags: David Byrne · Feist · music · Sinead O’Connor · video\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

          "description": "From 1913 to 1944, amateur mycologist Hans Walty created hundreds of fantastic watercolor illustrations of mushrooms, which are available to peruse in very high-resolution at Wikimedia Commons. There’s not a great deal of information about Walty or his drawings online,1 but I did find this piece from the Swiss National Library. \nHis images depict the colours and shapes of the mushrooms’ fruiting bodies and sometimes also include drawings of microscopic views. The fungi are usually depicted from the side and often from the top and bottom as well. Walty also frequently documented the characteristics of the stems, spores and undersides of the caps. The hobby mycologist also produced an explanatory book to accompany his illustrations that contains descriptions of the mushrooms, with each specimen being assigned a family and genus. His illustrations often contain notes about the time and date the mushroom was found and whether it was edible, inedible or poisonous.\n\n\nWalty’s illustrations were published in multiple editions of a Swiss mushroom guide from the 40s through the 70s. According to the German version of Wikipedia (translated): “For decades, 500 of his illustrations on mushrooms were considered a standard work on mushroom identification, especially in Switzerland.”\nAgain, you can browse through hundreds of Walty’s mushroom illustrations at Wikimedia Commons. (thx, christoph)\n\nNot in English at least; Walty was born in Italy and lived in Germany and Switzerland for much of his life. A biography is available on the German version of Wikipedia. ↩\n\nTags: art · fungi · Hans Walty · mushrooms\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

In 2017, four years after its grand reopening, Amsterdam's Rijksmuseum welcomed its 10-millionth visitor, a man named Stefan Kasper. His lucky timing resulted in getting to spend the night in the museum, where he dined and slept underneath Rembrandt's the Night Watch.\n\nHere's a short video of Kasper's time in the museum:\n\nI still can't believe it. I discovered characters that I have never seen before. They came to life in front of me. It's an experience that is forever etched in my memory.\n\n\nNot the same, but I got to go to a press preview when the MoMA reopened a few years ago after renovations and it was quite an experience to wander those familiar galleries pretty much by myself. I stood in front of Starry Night and One: Number 31, 1950 for a really long time that morning.\nTags: art · museums · Rembrandt · Rijksmuseum · Stefan Kasper · video\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

          "description": "In a piece about how English and North American robins (two unrelated species that don't even share a biological genus or family) got their names, Robert Francis shares how some English birds were given people names...and some of them stuck.\nDuring the 15th century, the English had an endearing practice of granting common human names to the birds that lived among them. Virtually every bird in that era had a name, and most of them, like Will Wagtail and Philip Sparrow have been long forgotten. Polly Parrot has stuck around, and Tom Tit and Jenny Wren, personable companions of the English countryside, are names still sometimes found in children's rhymes. Other human names, however, have been incorporated so durably into the common names that still grace birds as to almost entirely obscure their origin. The Magpie, a loquacious black and white bird with a penchant for snatching shiny objects, once bore the simple name \"pie,\" probably coming from its Roman name, \"pica.\" The English named these birds Margaret, which was then abbreviated to Maggie, and finally left at Mag Pie.[2] The vocal, crow-like bird called Jackdaw was also once just a \"daw\" named \"Jack.\" \nThe English also gave their ubiquitous and beloved orange-bellied, orb-shaped, wren-sized bird a human name. The first recorded Anglo-Saxon name for the Eurasian Robin was ruddoc, meaning \"little red one.\" By the medieval period, its name evolved to redbreast (the more accurate term orange only entered the English language when the fruit of the same name reached Great Britain in the 16th century). The English chose the satisfyingly alliterative name Robert for the redbreast, which they then changed to the popular Tudor nickname Robin. Soon enough, the name Robin Redbreast became so identified with the bird that Redbreast was dropped because it seemed so redundant.\n\n\nI found this list of other people names for birds as well — other examples include jays and martins.

The idea is that this way, only the best, most vital bits survive.\n\"It's not even the words on the page that accumulate, because I never look at them again, really, but the ideas and the characters start to take on gravity and density,\" she said.\n\"Nothing matters except for these lightning bolts that I've discovered,\" she continued, \"the images that are happening, the sounds that are happening, that feel alive. Those are the only things that really matter from draft to draft.\"\n\n\nAnd also this:\nIn the afternoon, Groff deals with the business of being an author, responding to emails, doing publicity, writing blurbs. And she reads. A lot. In just the past few days, she said, she finished \"Living and Dying With Marcel Proust,\" completed a reread of \"Moby Dick,\" and started a graphic novel called \"Roaming.\" She estimates she reads about 300 books a year.\nGroff will drop quotes into casual conversation, citing, say, Frank Lloyd Wright's take on form and function, but she manages to do this in an entirely unaffected way, just tossing out an interesting nugget for consideration. Her editor, McGrath, said that Groff reread all of Shakespeare so she could write a version of \"The Vaster Wilds\" in iambic pentameter \"just for fun,\" as a way for her to master Elizabethan rhythms.\n\n\nAll of Shakespeare, just for fun. Yep.\n\nOr at least, trying to read. I've been super busy with work and at the end of the day, the last thing I want to do is read more. But I will get back to it!↩\n\nTags: books · Lauren Groff · The Vaster Wilds · writing",

Currently, there's no profile information available for commenters...you can't click on a name to visit their Instagram acct or whatever. That feature is on my to-do list but it might be awhile before I get to it. But I know folks are curious about who reads the site...\nSo, in the meantime, if you feel comfortable sharing, you can use this thread to introduce yourself: maybe where you live, what you're into, your social accounts. I think many of us smartly err on the side of not sharing too many specific details about ourselves online (myself included, but it's obviously complicated 🙃) due to safety issues, but I think it's possible to get to know each other a little bit without spilling too many beans.

Discovery is still poor (there's no list of open comment threads) and there aren't any notifications — even as an admin user, I have to go to the front page of the site and click into individual threads to see if there's anything new.

          "description": "The influential Whole Earth Catalog, along with a number of related publications, has been uploaded to The Internet Archive and is now available online for free at the Whole Earth Index. From Wired:\nThe Whole Earth Catalog was the proto-blog — a collection of reviews, how-to guides, and primers on anarchic libertarianism printed onto densely packed pages. It carried the tagline \"Access to Tools\" and offered know-how, product reviews, cultural analysis, and gobs of snark, long before you could get all that on the internet.\nAt the time of its initial publication in the late 1960s, the periodical became a beacon for techno-optimists and back-to-the-land hippies. The Whole Earth Catalog preached self-reliance, teaching young baby boomers how to build their own cabins, garden sheds, and geodesic domes after they had turned on, tuned in, and dropped out — well before they grew wealthy enough to buy up all the three-bedroom single-family homes. The catalog also had a profound impact on Silicon Valley's ethos, and is credited with seeding the ideas that helped fuel today's startup culture.\n\n\n \nTags: The Whole Earth Catalog",

In this video, which has only recently been made public, you can see Byrne practicing his now-iconic moves.\n40 years ago, David Byrne rehearsed dances for Talking Heads' upcoming Speaking in Tongues tour by recording video of himself to determine which moves worked better than others, which developed into many of the iconic moves seen in the Stop Making Sense movie, filmed at the end of 1983 and released in 1984. It was recently rereleased by A24 in restored 4K. These videos, recorded in David Byrne's loft, have been mentioned before in interviews and now after 40 years the footage is finally available!\n\n\nIf you don't want to sit through the full 25-minute video, here's an hors d'oeuvres version:\n\n(via open culture)\nTags: dance · David Byrne · movies · music · Stop Making Sense · Talking Heads · video\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

Wistful talk of \"real America\" aside, Conn, who teaches at Miami University, in Oxford, Ohio, argues that the rural United States is, in fact, highly artificial. Its inhabitants are as much creatures of state power and industrial capitalism as their city-dwelling counterparts. But we rarely acknowledge this, Conn writes, because many of us — urban and rural, on the left and the right — \"don't quite want it to be true.…",

Club has taken on the task of ranking the best 50 music videos, from the first video ever played on MTV (Video Killed the Radio Star by The Buggles, featuring none other than soundtrack composer Hans Zimmer on keys) to Thriller, Sabotage, Addicted to Love, and Sledgehammer. You can watch the whole list via this playlist on YouTube.\n\nI loved the video for Sledgehammer. I was 12 years old the summer it came out. We didn't have cable TV then, but I'd turn on MTV anywhere I could, hoping for a glimpse of it. My dad used to take my sister and me on roadtrips all over the country and I vividly remember the rare times we got to stay in a motel (they had to have a swimming pool with a diving board), turning on MTV, and catching that Sledgehammer video a few times every hour. It was only years later, after becoming a Wallace and Gromit fan, that I learned that — of course! — Aardman had done the animation for Sledgehammer.\nTags: Aardman Animations · best of · Hans Zimmer · lists · MTV · music · Peter Gabriel · The Buggles · video\n💬 Join the discussion on kottke.org →",

Recently, an avid whale watcher and good friend, Buddy, died. One of Buddy's wishes was that Tom spread his ashes on the ocean he loved so much.\nSo, on a beautiful summer evening, Tom canceled his usual nightly cruise and organized a private memorial service. More than 80 of Buddy's friends and family members came to say a last goodbye.\nA serious-looking young woman who sat quietly by herself was among the passengers. None of the other people, including the crew members, knew who she was.\n\n\nI won't spoil the ending...you'll have to click through to read.\nI've never been to any memorial services at sea, but I did go whale watching in Alaska once. The extremely salty captain of the boat had two prosthetic hands with hooks on them (as Tom Nash demonstrates in this video). After we got underway, he left his first mate in charge and came out on the windy deck, got a cigarette and a matchbook out of his shirt pocket, tore off a match, and, with a single try, lit the cigarette. In, like, whipping 20 mph winds with the boat heaving in the waves. He was standing right in front of me when as he did it and it remains one of the most physically impressive things I have ever seen a person do. The man was so perfectly in his element that it was almost magical.",

We've been at them before.\nShe shows how this moment is part of an ongoing struggle between a small group of white people who think that America was founded on principles of white supremacy and should remain that way, and the rest of us.\n\n\nThroughout US history, the white supremacists have seized power and implemented minority rule: secession, Jim Crow & anti-immigration laws. Then the majority pushes back: the Civil War & Reconstruction, The New Deal.\nThe current GOP is a backlash against Brown v Board of Education (the Supreme Court case that declared racial segregation in schools unconstitutional.)\nRichardson traces in detail how that backlash happened, and how today's backlash echoes the language and attitudes of the Confederacy.\nShe shows Nixon and others tied taxes to \"redistributing wealth\" to \"undeserving\" people as a way to get lower income racists aboard an economic agenda that hurt them.\n\n\nI really have to make time to read this book!\nTags: books · Democracy Awakening · Heather Cox Richardson · politics · racism · Teri Kanefield · USA",

Sitting with grief can feel like we're frozen in shock or being pulled between heavy feelings and numbness. In this calming visualization, Headspace Meditation and Mindfulness Teacher Dora Kamau teaches us that grief is non-linear and how to practice self-compassion throughout each phase of grief. We'll learn ways to be present with our grief or intense sadness so that we can allow our emotions to move through us instead of feeling stuck.\n\n\nSee also How Do You Help a Grieving Friend?, How to help a friend through a tough time, according to a clinical psychologist, What To Do About Our Collective Pandemic Grief Before It Overwhelms Us, Grief Is Unexpressed Love, and How to Process Our Collective Global Trauma.

(Content warning: this article lists many violent acts, none of which are performed.)\nAt precisely 9 in the morning, working with focus and stealth, our entire membership succeeded in simultaneously beheading no one. At 10, Phase II began, during which our entire membership did not force a single man to suck another man's penis. Also, none of us blew himself/herself up in a crowded public place. No civilians were literally turned inside out via our powerful explosives. In addition, at 11, in Phase III, zero (0) planes were flown into buildings.\nDuring Phase IV, just after lunch, we were able to avoid bulldozing a single home. Furthermore, we set, on roads in every city, in every nation in the world, a total of zero (0) roadside bombs which, not being there, did not subsequently explode, killing/maiming a total of nobody. No bombs were dropped, during the lazy afternoon hours, on crowded civilian neighborhoods, from which, it was observed, no post-bomb momentary silences were then heard. These silences were, in all cases, followed by no unimaginable, grief-stricken bellows of rage, and/or frantic imprecations to a deity. No sleeping baby was awakened from an afternoon nap by the sudden collapse and/or bursting into flame of his/her domicile during Phase IV.\n\n\nIt's a timely reminder of the overwhelming huge number of people in the world who are not militant extremists — but also of the power held by the tiny minority that are.\nTags: George Saunders · politics · terrorism · war",

          "description": "Hey all. I'm going to be launching a new thing here soon (more on that in a few days), but you may have already noticed some changes around here. Design tweaks mostly. What you don't see is that I pretty much ripped out the main guts of the site and rewrote a key piece of it...painful but necessary for some upcoming features. Hooooopefully it's all working properly, but let me know if you see anything amiss? Especially with the membership stuff?\nAnyway, one of the changes that people using RSS/newsreaders to read the site will have noticed is that the Quick Links are no longer bundled up into a few digests/day...they now arrive as they're posted, one at a time. So if you got a bunch of old Quick Links clogging up your feedreader this morning, sorry about that — it should be a one-time thing.\nAlso regarding the RSS feed: the QL RSS items do not have titles (they are optional IIRC) and I'm getting a glimpse of the ways in which various newsreaders, uh, deal with title-less items. 😬 I've tested Feedly and Feedbin, but if you use another newsreader, would you mind emailing me a screenshot of how it handles these title-less Quick Links? Thanks!\nUpdate: Ok, I've got FreshRSS, Newsblur, Unread, Reeder, NetNewsWire, Newsify, Newsboat, Inoreader, The Old Reader, Tiny Tiny RSS, Vienna, and a few others.

          "description": "You may have previously read about the Citicorp Center. Joe Morgenstern wrote about the Manhattan skyscraper in a classic New Yorker piece from 1995. The building was built incorrectly and might have blown over in a stiff wind if not for a timely intervention on the part of a mystery architecture student and the head structural engineer on the project.\nTells about designer William J. LeMessurier, who was structural consultant to the architect Hugh Stubbins, Jr. They set their 59-story tower on four massive nine-story-high stilts and used an unusual, chevron-shaped system of wind braces. LeMessurier had established the strength of those braces in perpendicular winds. Now, in the spirit of intellectual play, in his Harvard class, he wanted to see if they were just as strong in winds hitting from 45 degrees. He discovered the design flaw and during wind tunnel tests in Ontario learned the weakest joint was at the building's 30th floor.\n\n\t\nThe whole piece is here and well worth a read. Last month, the excellent 99% Invisible did a radio show about Citicorp Center and added a new bit of information to the story: the identity of the mystery student who prodded LeMessurier to think more deeply about the structural integrity of his building.

This video is 45 minutes long and during that time, a photon emitted from the Sun1 will only travel through a portion of our solar system.\n\nIn our terrestrial view of things, the speed of light seems incredibly fast. But as soon as you view it against the vast distances of the universe, it's unfortunately very slow. This animation illustrates, in realtime, the journey of a photon of light emitted from the sun and traveling across a portion of the solar system.\n\n\t\nIt takes light more than 43 minutes to travel to Jupiter and even to travel the diameter of the Sun takes 4.6 seconds. (thx, andy)\nTo even fight its way out of the Sun is an incredible journey for a photon. The Sun is so dense that a photon generated at the core is absorbed and re-emitted trillions of times by hydrogen nuclei on its way out. By some estimates, it may take up to 40,000 years for a photon to escape the Sun's surface and head on out to the cold reaches of space.↩\n[This was originally posted on February  3, 2015.]\nTags:astronomy    \nphysics    \nscience    \nvideo",

          "description": "Amazon has a bunch of stuff on sale today & tomorrow for an \"event\" they're calling Prime Big Deal Days. I'm not going to do a big roundup here, but here are a few things you might be interested in if you're an Amazon shopper:\nApple AirPods Pro (2nd Gen) with Lightning connector for $189 (24% off). This is the lowest price I've seen on these; they're the best headphones I've ever owned. Apple just released a newer version of these (nearly the same product except for a USB-C connector on the case) and the low price is probably to clear out inventory. Both versions charge just fine with a MagSafe or Qi-certified charger, so why not get the cheaper one if you charge that way and don't care about the small differences? Update: Both versions are the same price (I don't think they were this morning). So get the newer ones!\nApple 2020 MacBook Air Laptop M1 for $750 (25% off). This is my laptop. I love this laptop. When my daughter needed a new computer for high school, I bought her one of these.\n\n\n\nAmazon Kindle Paperwhite for $95 (32% off). I read all my books on this. Lightweight and the battery lasts forever. And it charges with USB-3 so that's one less cable to haul around.\n\n\n\nSAF Aranet4 Home CO2 Monitor for $159 (36% off). This is everyone's pick for the best indoor air quality monitor.\n\n\n\nSplendor Board Game for $20.49 (54% off). This has been a recent hit around our house...very easy to play but still difficult to master.\n\n\n\nKitchenAid 3.5 Qt. Stand Mixer for $260 (32% off). This is KitchenAid's smaller stand mixer, which is lighter and takes up less counter space in smaller kitchens.\n\nYou can find more deals on the Prime Big Deal Days page.\nWhen you buy through links on kottke.org, I may earn an affiliate commission.

The latest installment in the legendary series, 17 years after the first one was released, will once again be presented by Sir David Attenborough, now 97 years old and still as enthusiastic about sharing the wonders of nature as he ever was.\n'The opening of the series with David was filmed in the beautiful British countryside in exactly the location where Charles Darwin used to walk whilst thinking-over his Earth-shaking ideas about evolution. It seemed the perfect place for David to introduce Planet Earth III and remind us of both the wonders and the fragility of our planet. ....and for him, of course, the sun shined under blue skies one of the only days it did all summer!.'\n\n\nThe video above is a quick first look at the series and here's a trailer as well:\n\nLooking forward to this...the Planet Earth series is still the gold standard for nature documentaries.\nTags: David Attenborough · Planet Earth · trailers · TV · video",

          "description": "From The Economist on the occasion of the award of the Nobel Prize for Medicine to Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman for their work that led to the development of the Covid-19 mRNA vaccines, a lovely short appreciation of vaccines.\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) says that vaccines have saved more from death than any other medical invention. It is a hard claim to gainsay. Vaccines protect people from disease cheaply, reliably and in remarkable numbers. And their capacity to do so continues to grow. In 2021 the who approved a first vaccine against malaria; this week it approved a second.\nVaccines are not only immensely useful; they also embody something beautifully human in their combination of care and communication. Vaccines do not trick the immune system, as is sometimes said; they educate and train it. As a resource of good public health, they allow doctors to whisper words of warning into the cells of their patients. In an age short of trust, this intimacy between government policy and an individual's immune system is easily misconstrued as a threat. But vaccines are not conspiracies or tools of control: they are molecular loving-kindness.\n\n\nThe WHO says that vaccines currently prevent 4-5 million deaths per year. The CDC points to a paper that says that more than 50 million death can be prevented  between 2021 and 2030. Vaccination is nothing short of a scientific miracle.

They are reshaping America's religious landscape as we know it.\nIn U.S. religion today, \"the most important story without a shadow of a doubt is the unbelievable rise in the share of Americans who are nonreligious,\" said Ryan Burge, a political science professor at Eastern Illinois University and author of \"The Nones,\" a book on the phenomenon.\nThe nones account for a large portion of Americans, as shown by the 30% of U.S. adults who claim no religious affiliation in a survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\nOther major surveys say the nones have been steadily increasing for as long as three decades.\nSo who are they?\nThey're the atheists, the agnostics, the \"nothing in particular.\" They're the \"spiritual but not religious,\" and those who are neither or both. They span class, gender, age, race and ethnicity.\nWhile the nones' vast diversity splinters them into myriad subgroups, most of them have this in common:\nThey. Really. Don't. Like. Organized. Religion.\n\n\nBut a dislike of organized religion among the nonreligious doesn't necessarily translate into atheism or agnosticism: 43% of \"the nones\" say they believe in God.\nTags: books · religion · Ryan Burge · The Nones · USA",

          "description": "Erik Wernquist made his short film One Revolution Per Minute to explore his \"fascination with artificial gravity in space\". The film shows what it would be like to travel on a large, circular space station, 900 meters (0.56 miles) in diameter that rotates a 1 rpm. Even at that slow speed, which generates 0.5 g at the outermost shell, I was surprised to see how quickly the scenery (aka the Earth, Moon, etc.) was rotating and how disorienting it would be as a passenger.\nRealistically - and admittedly somewhat reluctantly — I assume that while building a structure like this is very much possible, it would be quite impractical for human passengers.\nPutting aside the perhaps most obvious problem with those wide windows being a security hazard, I believe that the perpetually spinning views would be extremely nauseating for most humans, even for short visits. Even worse, I suspect — when it comes to the comfort of the experience — would be the constantly moving light and shadows from the sun.\n\n\nI calculated that the outer ring of the space station is moving at 105.4 mph with respect to the center. That's motoring right along — no wonder everything outside is spinning so quickly.\nTags: Erik Wernquist · physics · science · space · video",

You have to laugh at the number of times he says, \"Well, I didn't want to make this film, but...\" From an accompanying profile/interview with Scorsese (which is quite good as well):\nIt is a peculiar fact about Martin Scorsese that he does not enjoy actually making movies. \"I don't mean to be funny,\" he said, \"but, the thing is, you get up real early.\" And Scorsese has never been a morning person. For most of his life, he recalled, \"I'd stay up late watching movies on TV or reading late, or doing homework late, or trying to write scripts late. I lived at night and the streets were dark, and I never saw the light. It took me many years to understand where the sun set and where the sun rose. I didn't know. I'm not kidding. I learned it in LA. When you're going on Sunset Boulevard and you hit the Pacific Coast Highway and it's seven o'clock and the sun is setting — it's right there.\"\nHe likes to borrow a complaint from Kubrick. \"They said, 'What's the hardest thing about directing?' He said, 'Getting out of the car.' Because once you get out of the car, the questions start.\" Now, when Scorsese gets out of the car in the morning, he looks at his AD and says, \"What can't I have today?\"\n\n\n Tags: film school · interviews · Martin Scorsese · movies · video",

Here's how it works:\nGoogle likely alters queries billions of times a day in trillions of different variations. Here's how it works. Say you search for \"children's clothing.\" Google converts it, without your knowledge, to a search for \"NIKOLAI-brand kidswear,\" making a behind-the-scenes substitution of your actual query with a different query that just happens to generate more money for the company, and will generate results you weren't searching for at all. It's not possible for you to opt out of the substitution. If you don't get the results you want, and you try to refine your query, you are wasting your time. This is a twisted shopping mall you can't escape.\n\n\nYuuuck. I think it might be time to switch away from Google search — its results have been getting worse for years and it seems like the company doesn't care too much about fixing it.

Ballast fills the top of each square portal, countering the weight of the bridge deck that connects them. This symmetry allows the whole bridge structure to smoothly role through 180 degrees to a fully inverted position facilitating movement of boats from the river to the dock. This finely balanced is this system allows the 13 tonne bridge to be operated via hand winches only.\n\n\nHere's a video about the then-proposed bridge from 2019 that shows the unique rolling mechanism:\n\nAnd here's a video from earlier this year that shows the design process and how the finished bridge works:\n\nTags: architecture · Thomas Randall-Page",

Gould's passion for hummingbirds led him to travel to various parts of the world, such as North America, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, to observe and collect specimens. He also received many specimens from other naturalists and collectors.\n\n\nThe image at the top of the post is the gorgeous poster that Rougeux created from the drawings in Gould's monograph...you can order some for your walls and read a making-of.\nSee also other projects by Rougeux that I've posted about.\nTags: art · birds · design · infoviz · John Gould · Nicholas Rougeux · science",

Although, \"triple dick art history\" did lead me to this interesting piece on \"ostentatio genitalium\":\nOstentatio genitalium (the display of the genitals) refers to disparate traditions in Renaissance visual culture of attributing formal, thematic, and theological significance to the penis of Jesus.\n\n\nThis bit got me laughing again:\n...these Renaissance images shock us because they are so frequently ithyphallic: Christ has risen, but not in the way we have come to expect.\n\n\n Tags: art · art school · Evan Puschak · Hans Holbein the Younger · Henry VIII · religion · video",

Many of these images are time machines, showing the various meanders these rivers took hundreds and thousands of years ago. As I wrote in a post about the Mississippi River meander maps designed by Army Corps of Engineers cartographer Harold Fisk:\nFisk's maps represent the memory of a mighty river, with thousands of years of course changes compressed into a single image by a clever mapmaker with an artistic eye. Looking at them, you're invited to imagine the Mississippi as it was during the European exploration of the Americas in the 1500s, during the Cahokia civilization in the 1200s (when this city's population matched London's), when the first humans came upon the river more than 12,000 years ago, and even back to before humans, when mammoths, camels, dire wolves, and giant beavers roamed the land and gazed upon the river.\n\n\nCoe has put 4K versions of these images up on Flickr in both landscape and portrait aspect ratios. They work really well for computer and phone wallpapers — I've been using this one on various devices since I first saw it years ago.\nTags: Dan Coe · geology · Harold Fisk · rivers",

It begins:\nFor years after World War II, the \"liberal consensus\" — the New Deal idea that the federal government had a role to play in regulating business, providing a basic social safety net, and promoting infrastructure — was a true consensus. It was so widely popular that in 1950, the critic Lionel Trilling wrote of the United States that \"liberalism is not only the dominant but even the sole intellectual tradition.\"\nBut the Supreme Court's 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision declaring segregation in public schools unconstitutional tied the federal government to ensuring not just economic equality, but also civil rights. Opponents of the liberal consensus argued that the newly active federal government was misusing tax dollars taken from hardworking white men to promote civil rights for \"undeserving\" Black people. The troops President Dwight Eisenhower sent to Little Rock Central High School in 1957, for example, didn't come cheap. The government's defense of civil rights redistributed wealth, they said, and so was virtually socialism.\n\n\n Tags: books · Democracy Awakening · Heather Cox Richardson · politics · racism · USA",

          "description": "Heather Cox Richardson, author of the excellent Letters from an American newsletter, has a new book out today about the health of American democracy: Democracy Awakening: Notes on the State of America. From Virginia Heffernan's review of the book in the Washington Post:\nShe has an intriguing origin point for today's afflictions: the New Deal. The first third of the book, which hurtles toward Donald Trump's election, is as bingeable as anything on Netflix. \"Democracy Awakening\" starts in the 1930s, when Americans who'd been wiped out in the 1929 stock market crash were not about to let the rich demolish the economy again. New Deal programs designed to benefit ordinary people and prevent future crises were so popular that by 1960 candidates of both parties were advised to simply \"nail together\" coalitions and promise them federal funding. From 1946 to 1964, the liberal consensus — with its commitments to equality, the separation of church and state, and the freedoms of speech, press and religion — held sway.\nBut Republican businessmen, who had caused the crash, despised the consensus. Richardson's account of how right-wingers appropriated the word \"socialism\" from the unrelated international movement is astute. When invoked to malign all government investment, \"socialism\" served to recruit segregationist Democrats, who could be convinced that the word meant Black people would take their money, and Western Democrats, who resented government protections on land and water. This new Republican Party created an ideology that coalesced around White Christianity and free markets.\n\n\nHeffernan calls this first part of Richardson's book \"the most lucid just-so story for Trump's rise I've ever heard\". I'm in the midst of two other books right now (The Vaster Wilds & The Mountain in the Sea) but I might have to make room for a third.\nTags: books · Democracy Awakening · Heather Cox Richardson · politics · USA · Virginia Heffernan",

The chart in question is from a piece in the most recent issue of the American Journal of Physics with the understated title of \"All objects and some questions\".\nIn Fig. 2, we plot all the composite objects in the Universe: protons, atoms, life forms, asteroids, moons, planets, stars, galaxies, galaxy clusters, giant voids, and the Universe itself. Humans are represented by a mass of 70 kg and a radius of 50 cm (we assume sphericity), while whales are represented by a mass of 10^5 kg and a radius of 7 m.\n\n\nThe \"sub-Planckian unknown\" and \"forbidden by gravity\" sections of the chart makes the \"quantum uncertainty\" section seem downright normal — the paper collectively calls these \"unphysical regions\". Lovely turns of phrase all.\nBut what does it all mean? My physics is too rusty to say, but I thought one of the authors' conjectures was particularly intriguing: \"Our plot of all objects also seems to suggest that the Universe is a black hole.\" Huh, cool.\nTags: infoviz · physics · science",

From the Public Domain Review:\nThe Blood Book is handmade, folio-sized, with a handsome marbled endpaper and forty-three pages of exquisitely crafted decoupage. John Bingley Garland, the manuscript's creator, used collage techniques, excising illustrations from other books to assemble elegant, balanced compositions. Most of the source material is Romantic engravings by William Blake and his ilk, but there are also brilliantly colored flowers and fruits. Snakes are a favorite motif, butterflies another. A small bird is centered on every page. The space between the images is filled with tiny hand-written script that reads like a staccato sermon. \"One! yet has larger bounties! to bestow! Joys! Powers! untasted! In a World like this, Powers!\" etc.\nThe book's reputation, however, rests on a decorative detail that overwhelms: To each page, Garland added languid, crimson drops in red India ink, hanging from the cut-out images like pendalogues from a chandelier. Blood drips from platters of grapes and tree boughs, statuaries and skeletons. Crosses seep, a cheetah drools, angels dangle bloody sashes. A bouquet of white chrysanthemums is spritzed.\nTo be clear, Garland's blood is not that of surgery or crime or menses, but of religious iconography. He obviously intended the blood to represent Christ's own.\n\n\nThe Blood Book are strikingly modern; as PDR states, Garland uses \"techniques usually dated to Cubism in the early twentieth century\" to make his collages. I love running across seemingly out-of-time objects like this.\nTags: art · John Bingley Garland · religion",

The second is expressing genuine regret, and where possible, acknowledging our shortcoming. Our intentions are not always good. Sometimes we're selfish. Sometimes we don't know what we're doing, and sometimes we fail to consider the consequences. If we can admit these things, it helps repair trust.\nThen we vow, in good faith, to not perpetuate the same harm again.\nThe last step is repair. This means directly addressing the harm done — not via self-flagellation on YouTube nor with any expectation of forgiveness.\n\n\nI posted about how to apologize a few years ago after reading Katie Heaney's piece on, wait for it, celebrity non-apologies:\nHere are the six components of an apology from Beth Polin:\n1. An expression of regret — this, usually, is the actual \"I'm sorry.\"\n\n\nI think about these components whenever giving or receiving apologies — it's a great framework to keep in mind.\nTags: Beth Polin · celebrity · Elizabeth Spiers · how to · Katie Heaney",

That's why you cannot escape: Stopping your fall and turning back would be just as impossible as stopping time and traveling to the past. So the singularity is actually in your future, not \"in front of you\". And just like you can't see your own future, you won't see the singularity until you hit it.\n\n\n🤯\nTags: black holes · Kurzgesagt · physics · science · video",

          "description": "Danny Cortes took up making patinated miniatures of familiar NYC objects during the pandemic and it turned into a full-time vocation for him. He spoke to the NY Times about how his work puts him in the flow state:\n\"I loved that when I worked on a piece, I didn't think about my problems — my divorce, the pandemic,\" said Mr. Cortes. \"It was an escape — like I'm meditating, literally floating. I didn't have a problem in the world. I wanted that high again, I kept chasing that.\"\n\n\nLove that and love the miniatures...they are crazy realistic.\nBlighted façades and distressed structures are the very scenes which fuel Daniel's attention to detail. The work to produce each piece is arduous and requires great precision to achieve such realism. Daniel had developed techniques that can give a model an aged, distressed or patinated style. He also recreates miniature scaled vintage advertising posters and graffiti art on his models. Daniel's miniature models make unique collectable creations that will take you on a gritty romantic journey through New York that everyday passers by have overlooked.\n\n\nYou can check out more of Cortes' work on Instagram.\nTags: art · Danny Cortes · NYC",

It's time we worked together towards a world where all people have the power and resources to care for and support their bodies, identities, and health — for themselves and their families. We need to take the hassle, hustle, and harassment out of healthcare. It's time to change the conversation about abortion, to make it a real option, available to all people without shame or judgment. We all love someone who has had an abortion, whether we know it or not.\n\n\nThe video is three years old and from the very first line (\"Abortion is legal in all 50 states\"), you can tell how much the situation has changed in the United States — and how the NNAF's mission is even more urgent. If you'd like to join me in donating, step right this way.\nTags: abortion · healthcare · Molly Crabapple · Padma Lakshmi · Renee Bracey Sherman · video",

Boys and girls.\nIt's imagination that counts. Not skill. You build whatever comes into your head, the way you want it. A bed or a truck. A dolls house or a spaceship.\nA lot of boys like dolls houses. They're more human than spaceships. A lot of girls prefer spaceships. They're more exciting than dolls houses.\nThe most important thing is to the put the right material in the their hands and let them create whatever appeals to them.\n\n\t\nThe letter seems like the sort of thing that might be fake, but Robbie Gonzalez of io9 presents the case for its authenticity.\nIn our home, Lego currently rules the roost...the kids (a boy and a girl) spend more time building with Lego than doing anything else. This weekend, they worked together to build a beach scene, with a house, pool, lifeguard station, car, pond (for skimboarding), and surfers. Dollhouse stuff basically. Then they raced around the house with Lego spaceships and race cars. Nailed it, 1970s Lego.\nUpdate: QZ confirms, the letter is genuine.\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n[This was originally posted on November 24, 2014.]\nTags:Lego    \nparenting",

While not as dramatic as some of the others, it documented the discovery of a previously unknown feature of a nearby cosmic neighbor:\nThe Andromeda galaxy is the closest spiral galaxy to our own Milky Way, and one of the most photographed deep-sky objects. Yet this particular photo, captured by an international trio of amateur astronomers, revealed a feature that had never been seen before: a huge plasma arc, stretching out across space right next to the Andromeda galaxy.\n\"Scientists are now investigating the newly discovered giant in a transnational collaboration,\" explain the photographers. \"It could be the largest such structure nearest to us in the Universe.\"\n\n\nYou can see the rest of the winning images on the Royal Observatory site as well as coverage from the BBC, the Guardian, Colossal, and Universe Today.\nTags: astronomy · best of · best of 2023 · photography · science · space",

          "description": "Birds of the World: The Art of Elizabeth Gould is a new book documenting the work of early 19th century naturalist artist Elizabeth Gould.\nArtist and illustrator Elizabeth Gould is finally given the recognition she deserves in this gorgeous volume that includes hundreds of her stunning and scientifically precise illustrations of birds from nearly every continent.\nFor all of her short life, Elizabeth Gould's artistic career was appreciated through the lens of her husband, ornithologist John Gould, with whom she embarked on a series of ambitious projects to document and illustrate the birds of the world. Elizabeth played a crucial role in her husband's lavish publications, creating beautifully detailed and historically significant accurate illustrations of over six hundred birds -many of which were new to science. However, Elizabeth's role was not always fully credited and, following her tragic death aged only thirty-seven, her efforts and talent were nearly forgotten.\n\n\nBirds of the World: The Art of Elizabeth Gould is available for pre-order from Amazon or Bookshop.org and comes out on November 7.

          "description": "The first teaser trailer for season four of the Apple TV+ series For All Mankind takes the form of a recruitment video encouraging people to join the burgeoning workforce in space. It doesn't give us much in the way of plot or character updates, but here's the season synopsis (spoilers if you're not caught up to the end of season three):\nRocketing into the new millennium in the eight years since Season 3, Happy Valley has rapidly expanded its footprint on Mars by turning former foes into partners. Now 2003, the focus of the space program has turned to the capture and mining of extremely valuable, mineral-rich asteroids that could change the future of both Earth and Mars. But simmering tensions between the residents of the now-sprawling international base threaten to undo everything they are working towards.\n\n\nI have to admit my interest in the show waned a bit after the first season, but it's still a pretty great show and I will be tuning in for season four on November 10. And is it just me or, if you tilt your head and squint, can you see For All Mankind as a prequel/origin story for The Expanse? (via gizmodo)\nTags: For All Mankind · space · trailers · TV · video",

From Deadline:\nUsing the NFL's Next Gen Stats and on-field tracking data, every player and play will be presented in \"Andy's Room,\" the familiar, brightly colored setting for the Toy Story franchise. The action will be virtually simultaneous with the main game telecast, with most plays recreated after an expected delay in the neighborhood of about 30 seconds. Woody, Buzz Lightyear and many other characters will be visible throughout, and a press release notes they will be \"participating from the sidelines and in other non-gameplay elements.\" Along with game action, the announcers, graphics, scoreboard, referees' penalty announcements, celebrations and other parts of the experience will all be rendered in a Toy Story-centric fashion.\n\n\nI stopped watching the NFL years ago, but I might tune in to see how this works.\nTags: animation · Disney · football · Pixar · remix · sports · Toy Story · TV · video",

          "description": "I really enjoyed this piece by Tom Vanderbilt on how time is kept, coordinated, calculated, and forecast. It's full of interested tidbits throughout, like:\nCare to gawk at one of the world's last surviving original radium standards, a glass ampoule filled with 20.28 milligrams of radium chloride prepared by Marie Curie in 1913? NIST has it in the basement, encased in a steel bathtub, buried under lead bricks.\n\n\nAnd:\nFor GPS to work, it needs ultra-exact timing: accuracy within fifteen meters requires precision on the order of fifty nanoseconds. The 5G networks powering our mobile phones demand ever more precise levels of cell-tower synchronization or calls get dropped.\n\n\nAnd:\nAnd as Mumford could have predicted, nowhere has time become so fetishized as in the financial sector, with the emergence over the past decade of algorithmic high-frequency trading. Donald MacKenzie, the author of Trading at the Speed of Light, estimated in 2019 that a trading program could receive market data and trigger an order in eighty-four nanoseconds, or eighty-four billionths of a second.\n\n\nAnd:\nAll this makes F1 staggeringly accurate: it will gain or shed only one second every 100,000,000 years. Since the days when time was defined astronomically, the accuracy of the second is estimated to have increased by a magnitude of eight.\n\n\nAnd:\n\"A clock accurate to a second over the age of the cosmos,\" Patrick Gill, a physicist at the U.K.'s National Physical Laboratory, is quoted as saying in New Scientist, \"would allow tests of whether physical laws and constants have varied over the universe's history.\"\n\n\nAnd:\n\"If you were to lift this clock up a centimeter of elevation,\" Hume told me, \"you would be able to discern a difference in the ticking rate.\" The reason is Einstein's theory of relativity: Time differs depending on where you are experiencing it.\n\n\nAnd I could go on and on. If any or all of those tidbits is interesting to you, you should go ahead and read the whole thing.\nTags: physics · science · time · Tom Vanderbilt",

          "description": "I love reading about speedrunning, specifically Super Mario Bros speedrunning, so this piece in Ars Technica about a new world record by Niftski is right up my alley. Here's the run if you want to watch it:\n\nFour particular things caught my eye about this run:\nNiftski's new record is 4m 54.631s, which is now faster than what was believed to be the theoretical limit for a human-played game.\nIt's also extremely close to the fastest SMB game ever played done using tool-assisted speedrunning (where you basically play in super slow motion, so you can make all the very precise movements easily, a la The Flash). \"In the battle of man versus machine, Niftski is now just 0.35 seconds away from standing up, John Henry-style, against the standard of machine-made automation.\"\n\n\n\nI always marvel at the level of dedication and ingenuity of the players working together (though competition) to lower the possible times through the tiniest of adjustments.\n\n\n\nHis heart rate tops out at 188bpm by the end of the game. I know he's sitting at a desk, but that's got to be of some cardiovascular advantage, right?\n\n👏👏👏\nTags: Super Mario Bros · video · video games",

          "description": "About once a year, boat owners on Wisconsin's Lake Chippewa gather to move a small floating island from blocking access under a bridge. It's a simple application of Newtonian physics: the boats all just nose into the island, gun their motors, and slowly shove the island out of the way.\nThe floating clump of mud and plant material is technically a bog, not an island, but it's hefty enough to support the growth of trees all the same. Looking at it, you could easily believe it was a fully-fledged island. That is... until it starts drifting around.\n\"It's one of the first things you look for when you come out here in the morning; where's the bog?\" Denny Reyes, owner of The Landing in Chippewa, told Arizona News.\nThe problematic bog is actually one of many, but it's one of the biggest and close to a bridge that can get blocked when it goes for a wander. In 2022, with the wind on their side, it took around 25 boats to budge the bog and collectively push it back out into the lake.\n\n\n Tags: time lapse · video",
