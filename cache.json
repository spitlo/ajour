It can run Spectrum (and the new Spectrum Next), C64, NES, Megadrive, SNES, PC Engine, Amiga 500, Vectrex, original arcade like Galaxian and Bubble Bobble and some more. To run the \"core\" it does require that someone has written the code to program the FPGA but there's a pretty good collection already available.",
