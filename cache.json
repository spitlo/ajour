Follow the tutorial on our website, or check out this amazing quick start guide by Polyducks. We also released niju, our little kana-learning game.

Other Yoruba-speaking programmers contributed, along with some non-speakers who were excited about a programming language created by and for West Africans.\n\r\n\r\nOne of the major contributors to the projects is a guy from the Igbo tribe.

I was talking to a friend yesterday who was studying for a programming\ninterview and trying to learn some algorithms basics.\nThe topic of quadratic-time vs linear-time algorithms came up, I thought this\nwould be fun to write about here because avoiding quadratic-time algorithms\nisn’t just important in interviews – it’s sometimes good to know about in real\nlife too! I’ll explain what a “quadratic-time algorithm is” in a minute :)\nhere are the 3 things we’ll talk about:\nquadratic time functions are WAY WAY WAY slower than linear time functions\nsometimes you can make a quadratic algorithm into a linear algorithm by using a hashmap\nthis is because hashmaps lookups are very fast (instant!)\nI’m going to try to keep the math jargon to a minimum and focus on real code\nexamples and how fast/…",

It’s a wonderful set of talks that happens every GDC in which each speaker is given five minutes to talk about anything they want. I talked about desktop pets, desktop toys, and why that entire concept is such a valuable mode of expression. I actually plan on writing a much longer, and more in-depth post about this (it might end up being a longer talk too), as soon as I have time… It’s a topic that has really grown on me because I think it offers so much...",

This is a notable update featuring a UI overhaul (it’s less intense now!), new templates, and a lot of fixes. I spent a lot of time making the UI friendlier. I couldn’t help myself so pop-up windows are cute pixel art. There’s animation to many elements, but I think it’s much more refined now. The main menu UI was always very “placeholder”, and many decisions in it had been for the sake of compromising for the...",

I’m honored to be part of this! The person I was teamed up with is Gvidas Pakarklis, who is an amazing illustrator and artist. You can see more of his work on Instagram.
