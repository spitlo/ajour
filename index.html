Brassica oleracea is a species of plant that, like the apple, has a number of different cultivars. But these cultivars differ widely from each other: cabbage, kale, broccoli, brussels sprouts, kohlrabi, collard greens, and cauliflower.


Welcome, redwood, to the family, er, species.

                  <p>Birds of the World: The Art of Elizabeth Gould is a new book documenting the work of early 19th century naturalist artist Elizabeth Gould.
Artist and illustrator Elizabeth Gould is finally given the recognition she deserves in this gorgeous volume that includes hundreds of her stunning and scientifically precise illustrations of birds from nearly every continent.
For all of her short life, Elizabeth Gould&#x27;s artistic career was appreciated through the lens of her husband, ornithologist John Gould, with whom she embarked on a series of ambitious projects to document and illustrate the birds of the world. Elizabeth played a crucial role in her husband&#x27;s lavish publications, creating beautifully detailed and historically significant accurate illustrations of over six hundred birds -many of which were new to science. However, Elizabeth&#x27;s role was not always fully credited and, following her tragic death aged only thirty-seven, her efforts and talent were nearly forgotten.


Birds of the World: The Art of Elizabeth Gould is available for pre-order from Amazon or Bookshop.org and comes out on November 7. (via colossal)

                  <p>The first teaser trailer for season four of the Apple TV+ series For All Mankind takes the form of a recruitment video encouraging people to join the burgeoning workforce in space. It doesn&#x27;t give us much in the way of plot or character updates, but here&#x27;s the season synopsis (spoilers if you&#x27;re not caught up to the end of season three):
Rocketing into the new millennium in the eight years since Season 3, Happy Valley has rapidly expanded its footprint on Mars by turning former foes into partners. Now 2003, the focus of the space program has turned to the capture and mining of extremely valuable, mineral-rich asteroids that could change the future of both Earth and Mars. But simmering tensions between the residents of the now-sprawling international base threaten to undo everything they are working towards.


I have to admit my interest in the show waned a bit after the first season, but it&#x27;s still a pretty great show and I will be tuning in for season four on November 10. And is it just me or, if you tilt your head and squint, can you see For All Mankind as a prequel/origin story for The Expanse? (via gizmodo)

                  <p>This is pretty clever actually: Disney+ and ESPN+ will air a real-time, Toy Story-ified version of the Oct 1st Jacksonville Jaguars and Atlanta Falcons NFL game. From Deadline:
Using the NFL&#x27;s Next Gen Stats and on-field tracking data, every player and play will be presented in &quot;Andy&#x27;s Room,&quot; the familiar, brightly colored setting for the Toy Story franchise. The action will be virtually simultaneous with the main game telecast, with most plays recreated after an expected delay in the neighborhood of about 30 seconds. Woody, Buzz Lightyear and many other characters will be visible throughout, and a press release notes they will be &quot;participating from the sidelines and in other non-gameplay elements.&quot; Along with game action, the announcers, graphics, scoreboard, referees&#x27; penalty announcements, celebrations and other parts of the experience will all be rendered in a Toy Story-centric fashion.


I stopped watching the NFL years ago, but I might tune in to see how this works.

                  <p>Hello! I was talking to a friend about how git works today, and we got onto the
topic – where does git store your files? We know that it’s in your .git
directory, but where exactly in there are all the versions of your old files?
For example, this blog is in a git repository, and it contains a file called
content/post/2019-06-28-brag-doc.markdown. Where is that in my .git folder?
And where are the old versions of that file? Let’s investigate by writing some
very short Python programs.
git stores files in .git/objects
Every previous version of every file in your repository is in .git/objects.
For example, for this blog, .git/objects contains 2700 files.
$ find .git/objects/ -type f | wc -l
2761


note: .git/objects actually has more information than “every previous version
of every file in …</p>

I struggle to frame exactly what they are doing because Unity’s decision is so bizzarely resentful toward their huge developer base that trusted them. You can read this for context… I’ve done a lot of writing curating and covering tools, and showcasing alternatives to popular ones. I even have a collection on itch.io keeping track of things that are on that platform: https://itch.io/c/235488/cool-tools For myself, it is an imperative to always be aware of alternatives!

                  <p>Although ffconf has been running since 2009, sponsorship is always a process that you have to start from scratch. The event is organised by just Julie and myself, specifically we don&#x27;t have a dedicated sales person (perhaps we should?). This means keeping in touch with our sponsors and reaching out using a skill set that neither of us naturally possess.
I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a lot of smaller events like us that work similarly. So I write this to speak to the companies who would be great supporters and sponsors of our events, and I hope to explain to you (the companies and people who can help point your companies to us) what our events bring to the web community, and web business in general.</p>

                  <p>I really enjoyed this piece by Tom Vanderbilt on how time is kept, coordinated, calculated, and forecast. It&#x27;s full of interested tidbits throughout, like:
Care to gawk at one of the world&#x27;s last surviving original radium standards, a glass ampoule filled with 20.28 milligrams of radium chloride prepared by Marie Curie in 1913? NIST has it in the basement, encased in a steel bathtub, buried under lead bricks.


And:
For GPS to work, it needs ultra-exact timing: accuracy within fifteen meters requires precision on the order of fifty nanoseconds. The 5G networks powering our mobile phones demand ever more precise levels of cell-tower synchronization or calls get dropped.


And:
And as Mumford could have predicted, nowhere has time become so fetishized as in the financial sector, with the emergence over the past decade of algorithmic high-frequency trading. Donald MacKenzie, the author of Trading at the Speed of Light, estimated in 2019 that a trading program could receive market data and trigger an order in eighty-four nanoseconds, or eighty-four billionths of a second.


And:
All this makes F1 staggeringly accurate: it will gain or shed only one second every 100,000,000 years. Since the days when time was defined astronomically, the accuracy of the second is estimated to have increased by a magnitude of eight.


And:
&quot;A clock accurate to a second over the age of the cosmos,&quot; Patrick Gill, a physicist at the U.K.&#x27;s National Physical Laboratory, is quoted as saying in New Scientist, &quot;would allow tests of whether physical laws and constants have varied over the universe&#x27;s history.&quot;


And:
&quot;If you were to lift this clock up a centimeter of elevation,&quot; Hume told me, &quot;you would be able to discern a difference in the ticking rate.&quot; The reason is Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity: Time differs depending on where you are experiencing it.


And I could go on and on. If any or all of those tidbits is interesting to you, you should go ahead and read the whole thing.

                  <p>I love reading about speedrunning, specifically Super Mario Bros speedrunning, so this piece in Ars Technica about a new world record by Niftski is right up my alley. Here&#x27;s the run if you want to watch it:

Four particular things caught my eye about this run:
Niftski&#x27;s new record is 4m 54.631s, which is now faster than what was believed to be the theoretical limit for a human-played game.
It&#x27;s also extremely close to the fastest SMB game ever played done using tool-assisted speedrunning (where you basically play in super slow motion, so you can make all the very precise movements easily, a la The Flash). &quot;In the battle of man versus machine, Niftski is now just 0.35 seconds away from standing up, John Henry-style, against the standard of machine-made automation.&quot;



I always marvel at the level of dedication and ingenuity of the players working together (though competition) to lower the possible times through the tiniest of adjustments.



His heart rate tops out at 188bpm by the end of the game. I know he&#x27;s sitting at a desk, but that&#x27;s got to be of some cardiovascular advantage, right?

👏👏👏

                  <p>A group of students from ETH Zurich and Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts recently set a record for the fastest 0-62mph time with their hand-built electric car: 0.956 seconds. The 309-lb car got up to 62mph in just 40.3 feet, which is ~10 feet shorter than the width of a basketball court. The old record was 1.46 seconds, which this car just absolutely obliterated. For reference, the Tesla Plaid&#x27;s 0-60 time is 1.99 seconds.
The video of their run is kind of amazing...the car is just so ludicrously quick that I started giggling when it leapt off the line.

                  <p>In React, we don&#x27;t update the DOM directly, we tell React what we want the DOM to look like, and React tackles the rest. But how exactly does it do this? In this tutorial, we&#x27;ll unpack exactly when and why React re-renders, and how we can use this information to optimize the performance of our React apps.</p>

                  <p>One of the most foundational things to understand about JavaScript is that programs are made up of statements, and statements have slots for expressions. In this blog post, we&#x27;ll dig into how these two structures work, and see how building an intuition about this can help us solve practical problems.</p>

                  <p>For so many React devs, styled-components seems kinda magical. It isn&#x27;t at all clear how it uses traditional CSS features under-the-hood, and that lack of clarity can cause real problems when things go awry. In this post, we&#x27;ll learn exactly how styled-components works by building our own mini-version.</p>

                  <p>By and large, using the web is a visual experience. This is in terrible contrast to mobile apps, which interact with three of our human senses (sight, sound, and touch, through haptic feedback). I just released a library to make it easy to add sound to your React app, and I make the case that you should consider using it!</p>

                  <p>Love this recent JWST shot of the M51 spiral galaxy.
The graceful winding arms of the grand-design spiral galaxy M51 stretch across this image from the NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope. Unlike the menagerie of weird and wonderful spiral galaxies with ragged or disrupted spiral arms, grand-design spiral galaxies boast prominent, well-developed spiral arms like the ones showcased in this image. This galactic portrait was captured by Webb&#x27;s Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI).
In this image the reprocessed stellar light by dust grains and molecules in the medium of the galaxy illuminate a dramatic filamentary medium. Empty cavities and bright filaments alternate and give the impression of ripples propagating from the spiral arms. The yellow compact regions indicate the newly formed star clusters in the galaxy.

                  <p>About once a year, boat owners on Wisconsin&#x27;s Lake Chippewa gather to move a small floating island from blocking access under a bridge. It&#x27;s a simple application of Newtonian physics: the boats all just nose into the island, gun their motors, and slowly shove the island out of the way.
The floating clump of mud and plant material is technically a bog, not an island, but it&#x27;s hefty enough to support the growth of trees all the same. Looking at it, you could easily believe it was a fully-fledged island. That is... until it starts drifting around.
&quot;It&#x27;s one of the first things you look for when you come out here in the morning; where&#x27;s the bog?&quot; Denny Reyes, owner of The Landing in Chippewa, told Arizona News.
The problematic bog is actually one of many, but it&#x27;s one of the biggest and close to a bridge that can get blocked when it goes for a wander. In 2022, with the wind on their side, it took around 25 boats to budge the bog and collectively push it back out into the lake.

He. Skis. THROUGH THE MOUNTAIN. Also, if you can, pause it right after he jumps off the lift platform...the kid on the lift with his dad is like ( ﾟoﾟ).
No one has ever asked me this. No one ever asks people questions like this. &quot;People ask me...&quot; is a phrase writers use to create a sense of an ongoing story. It&#x27;s better than &quot;This is a cool video&quot;...you can only use that one so many times. ↩

                  <p>About a year ago I came across the Kettle Companion which is a lovely idea: you share a device with a loved one, and when they boil their kettle, you get a little notification on a device (a toy kettle) either letting you know they&#x27;re okay or maybe you want to give them a call for a coffee and a chat.
However, I have my reservations: firstly, I don&#x27;t need a toy kettle in my own home, more importantly, the service has a hosted server monitoring for some kind of event, is that service going to stay online for perhaps 20 years?
Anything that I rely on for actual long term living I&#x27;m am extremely wary of relying on a 3rd party company for. So, although I think Kettle Companion is a neat service, I&#x27;d rather have control.
So this is how I&#x27;ve solved it myself.</p>

                  <p>Nature does its thing so quickly sometimes that you have to slow it down to appreciate the beauty and power of it. This is a video of a kingfisher plucking fish out of the water, with views from both above the water (which catches the dive and takeoff) and below the water (which shows the efficient grab of the fish). The underwater view is amazing...I&#x27;d never seen that before.

                  <p>Going to the movies used to be a somewhat different experience than it is today: people wandered into a theater at any point in a film and would just watch until it looped back around when they came in. From a piece in the Hollywood Reporter:
Throughout the classical Hollywood era, moviegoers dropped in on a film screening whenever they felt like it, heedless of the progress of the narrative. In the usual formulation, a couple go to the movies, enter midway into the feature film, sit through to the end of the movie, watch the newsreel, cartoon, and comedy short at the top of the program, and then sit through the feature film until they recognize the scene they walked in on. At this point, one moviegoer whispers to their partner, &quot;This is where we came in,&quot; and they exit the theater.


This began to change in the 40s and 50s for a variety of reasons — theater owners and movie studios didn&#x27;t like it, movies were getting more complex, the rise of TV, etc. — but the real shift occurred with the premiere of Psycho in 1960. The studio put out a promotional blitz before it&#x27;s release stating that no one would be allowed entrance to the theater after the start of the film.
On June 16, 1960, after a saturation campaign giving fair warning, the DeMille and Baronet theaters in New York premiered Psycho with the see-it-from-the-beginning edict in place. In a practice later to be known as &quot;fill and spill,&quot; exhibitors hustled audiences in and out with military efficiency (the staggered showtimes — every two-hours for the 109-minute film — made for a tight squeeze). Uniformed Pinkerton guards were on hand to enforce the policy.


Here&#x27;s a video of Hitchcock laying out the policy for moviegoers (via open culture):

Psycho didn&#x27;t singlehandedly stop the practice, but Hitchcock&#x27;s stand was an important part in shifting moviegoing practices to the set start times we have today.

                  <p>Really interesting video from Moth Light Media about how hummingbirds evolved into the unusual little creatures they are today.
The story of hummingbird evolution is how they have reaped the advantages of drinking a natural energy drink and then have had to evolve alien features to quell the disadvantages that have now gone on to define them.


Other popular videos from Moth Light Media include Evolution of Spider Webs, What Happens to Whale Bodies When They Die?, When Fungus Grew to the Size of Trees, and How Plants Became Meat Eaters.

                  <p>In this short video essay, Evan Puschak explores the typical life cycle of superhero storytelling, where things move from standalone stories to crossovers and interconnections, the stakes continually rise, and things get so complicated that entertainment becomes homework. Marvel in particular is in the later stages of this cycle,1 where casual fans are dropping off because they haven&#x27;t watched increasingly mediocre movies and full seasons of shows to keep up to date on what&#x27;s to come.

Star Wars is getting there too, and Star Trek seems like they&#x27;re trying their hardest to catch up.↩

                  <p>It is with the appropriate feelings of melancholy and excitement that I share with you the teaser trailer for The Boy and the Heron, the legendary Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s final animated feature film for Studio Ghibli.
A young boy named Mahito, yearning for his mother, ventures into a world shared by the living and the dead.
There, death comes to an end, and life finds a new beginning.
A semi-autobiographical fantasy about life, death, and creation, in tribute to friendship, from the mind of Hayao Miyazaki.


Miyazaki had previously retired after 2013&#x27;s The Wind Rises but according to Studio Ghibli co-founder Toshio Suzuki, he had good reason to come back for one more film:
Miyazaki is making the new film for his grandson. It&#x27;s his way of saying, &#x27;Grandpa is moving on to the next world, but he&#x27;s leaving behind this film.&#x27;


The Boy and the Heron opens on December 8 in the US. (via waxy)

                  <p>Somehow I&#x27;d never heard of this before watching this video (nor it seems, had much of anyone else outside of the participants), but the building located at 368 Broadway in Manhattan was, in the years after 9/11, the creative home for a surprising number of filmmakers: Greta Gerwig, Lena Dunham, the Safdie brothers (Josh &amp; Benny), the Neistat brothers (Casey &amp; Van), the Schulman brothers (Ariel &amp; Nev), and Henry Joost.

Here&#x27;s a clip of Van Neistat talking about those days (starting at 19:50):

Brian Eno had a word for places like 368 Broadway and the people who gather together to create: scenius. Austin Kleon elaborated on scenius in his book Show Your Work:
There&#x27;s a healthier way of thinking about creativity that the musician Brian Eno refers to as &quot;scenius.&quot; Under this model, great ideas are often birthed by a group of creative individuals — artists, curators, thinkers, theorists, and other tastemakers — who make up an &quot;ecology of talent.&quot; If you look back closely at history, many of the people who we think of as lone geniuses were actually part of &quot;a whole scene of people who were supporting each other, looking at each other&#x27;s work, copying from each other, stealing ideas, and contributing ideas.&quot; Scenius doesn&#x27;t take away from the achievements of those great individuals: it just acknowledges that good work isn&#x27;t created in a vacuum, and that creativity is always, in some sense, a collaboration, the result of a mind connected to other minds.

                  <p>Have you noticed there are a lot of different license plates you can choose for your car these days? So did Jon Keegan; he scraped the DMV websites of all 50 states and DC and came up with over 8,200 different plate combinations you might see out on the road.
By my count, there are currently 8,291 different vehicle license plates offered by the 50 states and the District of Columbia. States now offer a vast menu of personalized plate options for a dizzying array of organizations, professions, sports teams, causes and other groups. 
My count was conducted over June and July 2023, so this should be considered a snapshot, as I&#x27;m sure some plates have changed already.


Fun fact: finishers of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race are eligible to get a special &quot;Iditarod Finisher&quot; plate for their car.
Less fun fact, per Keegan:
Yes, license plates are still made by cheap prison labor in most states. 80% of all license plates issued in the U.S. today were made by state prisoners, with only 12 states opting out of the practice. According to a 2022 ACLU report on prison labor in the U.S., many states offer no pay at all to prisoners, while the average hourly wage across the country was between 13 and 52 cents per hour.


Here in Vermont, the use of prison labor for manufacturing things like license plates resulted in the image of a pig hidden in a cow&#x27;s spots appearing on an official crest emblazoned on state police cars back in 2012.

                  <p>Ryan Broderick on this year&#x27;s Burning Man shitshow as a metaphor for the climate crisis, America&#x27;s fraying social fabric, or our crumbling national infrastructure (pick two all three):
If you want to see what the next 25 years are going to be like, Burning Man is it. Millionaires and managers ignoring huge structural problems until it starts to impact their libertarian freak fests and then escaping to somewhere safe when they get the chance. Well, until there aren&#x27;t any safe places to escape to, I guess...

It turned out to be an inspired choice — according to an interview with Seligman, he was a natural.
He was one of the best improvisers I&#x27;ve ever worked with. I&#x27;m not overstating that. He improvised most of his stuff in the movie that ended up in the final cut! We couldn&#x27;t ever write something that would be as funny as what he gave us. He&#x27;d spew out the most brilliant jokes ever. I kept on encouraging him to do more improv.

This is not to be confused with the Pronunciation Manual channel, which does the same thing in the same format but much funnier and more incorrect.





I could have embedded a dozen more...I have no idea why I think these are so funny but I just cannot stop laughing at them. Ok, one more:

And this one! Make it stop!!
Update: My kids and I still use these mispronunciations around the house all the time. I cannot help looking at even the fanciest bottle of Châteauneuf-du-Pape without thinking choody-noofy-doopy-poopy.

It&#x27;s difficult to imagine something like this airing on the show now. Sesame Street was originally designed to serve the needs of children in low-income homes, but now the newest episodes of the show air first on HBO...a trickle-down educational experience. (via @kathrynyu)

                  <p>When most people think of bees, they picture the honeybee. But the honeybee is a domesticated animal — essentially livestock — and are well taken care of. The thousands of species of wild bee are paid less attention and are no less important to maintaining healthy ecosystems (and yes, helping out with pollination).
As a group, wild bees are considered incredibly important pollinators, especially for home gardens and crops that honey bees can&#x27;t pollinate. Tomatoes, eggplants, and peppers, for example, require &quot;buzz pollination;&quot; bees have to vibrate their bodies to shake the pollen free — a behavior that honey bees can&#x27;t do (bumblebees and some other native species can).
Yet these free services native bees provide are dwindling. While wild bees are, as a group, understudied, existing research suggests that many species are threatened with extinction, including more than a quarter of North American bumblebees.

                  <p>Adam Driver as Enzo Ferrari — a little too on the nose? Michael Mann hasn&#x27;t made a film since 2015&#x27;s Blackhat and hasn&#x27;t made an award-winning film since 2004&#x27;s Collateral, so it&#x27;s nice to see him back in the director&#x27;s chair. The film is based on Brock Yates&#x27; 1991 book Enzo Ferrari: The Man and the Machine.
Next to the Pope, Ferrari was the most revered man in Italy. But was he the benign padrone portrayed by an adoring world press at the time, or was he a ruthless despot, who drove his staff to the edge of madness, and his racing drivers even further?
Brock Yates&#x27;s definitive biography penetrated Ferrari&#x27;s elaborately constructed veneer and uncovered the truth behind Ferrari&#x27;s bizarre relationships, his work with Mussolini&#x27;s fascists, and his fanatical obsession with speed.


Ferrari just premiered at the Venice Film Festival and early reviews are mostly positive but not overwhelmingly so. The film opens on Dec 25 in the US.

                  <p>Once Upon a Time in Northern Ireland is a 5-part documentary series from director James Bluemel on the Troubles in Northern Ireland that is available to watch on PBS and BBC. A short1 trailer is above.
&quot;Once Upon a Time in Northern Ireland&quot; weaves together the personal stories of ordinary men, women and children who were drawn — both willingly and unwillingly — into a conflict that spanned over thirty years. The series mixes extraordinary archive footage and emotionally compelling first-person testimonies to create an intimate, multi-generational portrait of Northern Ireland&#x27;s past, present and future with an emphasis on understanding and empathy for all points of view.


I&#x27;ve heard really good things about this series and, after recently reading Patrick Radden Keefe&#x27;s excellent Say Nothin…</p>

There’s a lot of history and pop culture that has been left behind in them, but this in particular stands out to me. The primordial ancestor of ASCII art, from when goddamn typewriters were relatively common. There’s something so wonderfully human about it, looking back almost 60 years into the past and seeing such a familiar form of creation.</p>

                  <p>In 1856, a 17-year-old girl named Adeline Harris started making a unique quilt. Over the next two decades, she sent pieces of silk to famous people from around the world and they signed them and sent them back to her. She assembled them into a quilt with a tumbling blocks pattern (aka, the Q*bert pattern).
The signatures that Harris was able to acquire are astounding: Harriet Beecher Stowe, Charles Dickens, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Samuel Morse, Alexandre Dumas, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Alexander von Humboldt, Washington Irving, and Nathaniel Hawthorne. Oh, and eight US Presidents: Martin Van Buren, John Tyler, Millard Fillmore, Franklin Pierce, James Buchanan, Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Johnson, and Ulysses S. Grant.
The aesthetics of this thing are just marvelous, with all the different colors and patterns arranged into a strict grid.
Oh and I couldn&#x27;t resist checking The Great Span of the quilt. The earliest-born signatory I could find is Alexander von Humboldt, who was born in 1769, and the last person to die was Mary Virginia Hawes Terhune, who died in 1922. That&#x27;s a span of 154 years, all in one incredible quilt.
I found this via the Public Domain Review, who is offering prints of the quilt.

                  <p>Oh yay, I had been wondering just the other day what Errol Morris has been up to and it turns out to be a project with Apple TV+ called The Pigeon Tunnel, which is billed as the final interview with espionage novelist John le Carré (born David Cornwell).
It&#x27;s terribly difficult to recruit for a secret service. You&#x27;re looking for somebody who&#x27;s a bit bad, but at the same time, loyal. There&#x27;s a type. And I fit it perfectly.


The movie has the same title and covers some of the same ground as le Carré&#x27;s 2016 memoir, probably with more of an emphasis on Morris&#x27;s general obsession with what constitutes truth. More info on the film from the Toronto International Film Festival, where the movie is premiering on Sept 11:
Cornwell once worked for the British spy agencies MI5 and MI6. He sparingly gave interviews, but accepted Morris&#x27; invitation because he saw it &quot;as something definitive.&quot; He had already begun a process of opening up in his memoir The Pigeon Tunnel: Stories from My Life.
Crucial to the narrative is the author&#x27;s relationship to his father Ronnie, an inveterate gambler and con artist. Cornwell&#x27;s mother disappeared when he was five, so his main frame of reference was the world of his father, who was endlessly on the run from the mob or the police. The title The Pigeon Tunnel comes from Cornwell&#x27;s experience as a child going to Monte Carlo with Ronnie. Imprinted on his memory was a shooting range on the top of a cliff. Beneath the grass was a tunnel from which trapped pigeons were ejected over the sea as targets.


The Pigeon Tunnel will be out on Apple TV+ on Oct 20, 2023.

                  <p>Hey everyone! This is the list of all the changes we&#x27;ve done to our projects and apps during the month of August. We&#x27;ll also be reporting in our on position in the world, and on our future plans.
Summary Of Changes
100r.co, added Heriot Bay, Ballet Bay Octopus Islands, and updated Hathayim Marine Park, rain, and boom tent.
Oekaki, released a new drawing program.
Varvara, began versioning.
News
Pino sailed a bit more northward this month and went all the way to the Octopus Islands. We visited this place during a very windy week, with winds blowing 30-35 kts the entire time. We got acquainted with a few northern rapids, like Hole in the Wall and Surge Narrows. It is a bit of a mindfuck to think that in these waters the tide ebbs north and floods south.
This summer has been especially arid, and because of it the province has seen a lot forest fires (see pictures of our smokey transit). Trails that we know and love on Cortes Island, that are usually wet and muddy, were bone dry this year. We had a few days of hard rain, during that time we collect rain water and go for walks to  look for slugs and snails.
Both of us have been drawing a lot this month, see this Neoneve portrait(Mastodon) by Devine (drawn with Oekaki), and this sketch thread(Mastodon) by Rek..
Pino book club
We have read Adam Wisniewski-Snerg&#x27;s Robot, George Orwell&#x27;s Homage to Catalonia, and Michael A. Hiltzik&#x27;s Dealers of Ligthning.

                  <p>Market researcher Clotaire Rapaille was interviewed for an episode of Frontline on advertising and marketing back in 2003. I like what he had to say about the differences in how the French and Americans think about cheese.
For example, if I know that in America the cheese is dead, which means is pasteurized, which means legally dead and scientifically dead, and we don&#x27;t want any cheese that is alive, then I have to put that up front. I have to say this cheese is safe, is pasteurized, is wrapped up in plastic. I know that plastic is a body bag. You can put it in the fridge. I know the fridge is the morgue; that&#x27;s where you put the dead bodies. And so once you know that, this is the way you market cheese in America.
I started working with a French company in America, and they were trying to sell French cheese to the Americans. And they didn&#x27;t understand, because in France the cheese is alive, which means that you can buy it young, mature or old, and that&#x27;s why you have to read the age of the cheese when you go to buy the cheese. So you smell, you touch, you poke. If you need cheese for today, you want to buy a mature cheese. If you want cheese for next week, you buy a young cheese. And when you buy young cheese for next week, you go home, [but] you never put the cheese in the refrigerator, because you don&#x27;t put your cat in the refrigerator. It&#x27;s the same; it&#x27;s alive. We are very afraid of getting sick with cheese. By the way, more French people die eating cheese than Americans die. But the priority is different; the logic of emotion is different. The French like the taste before safety. Americans want safety before the taste.

                  <p>In a lecture given in 1924, German mathematician David Hilbert introduced the idea of the paradox of the Grand Hotel, which might help you wrap your head around the concept of infinity. (Spoiler alert: it probably won&#x27;t help...that&#x27;s the paradox.) In his book One Two Three... Infinity, George Gamow describes Hilbert&#x27;s paradox:
Let us imagine a hotel with a finite number of rooms, and assume that all the rooms are occupied. A new guest arrives and asks for a room. &quot;Sorry,&quot; says the proprietor, &quot;but all the rooms are occupied.&quot; Now let us imagine a hotel with an infinite number of rooms, and all the rooms are occupied. To this hotel, too, comes a new guest and asks for a room.
&quot;But of course!&quot; exclaims the proprietor, and he moves the person previously occupying room N1 into room N2, the person from room N2 into room N3, the person from room N3 into room N4, and so on.... And the new customer receives room N1, which became free as the result of these transpositions.
Let us imagine now a hotel with an infinite number of rooms, all taken up, and an infinite number of new guests who come in and ask for rooms.
&quot;Certainly, gentlemen,&quot; says the proprietor, &quot;just wait a minute.&quot;
He moves the occupant of N1 into N2, the occupant of N2 into N4, and occupant of N3 into N6, and so on, and so on...
Now all odd-numbered rooms became free and the infinite of new guests can easily be accommodated in them.

	
This TED video created by Jeff Dekofsky explains that there are similar strategies for finding space in such a hotel for infinite numbers of infinite groups of people and even infinite amounts of infinite numbers of infinite groups of people (and so on, and so on...) and is very much worth watching:

Then one day they say fuck it all. They eat leftover pasta over the sink, drop mom off at her mahjongg game, and go sit in the park to draw. They draw for hours, until the sun goes down and they&#x27;re squinting under the street lights. And, lo and behold, the next day they plow through all those lingering to-dos. They see clearly that half of them were unnecessary when before they all seemed critical. They recognize a few others as things better handed off to th…</p>

                  <p>Yesterday, there was yet another school shooting on a college campus, this time at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. A UNC graduate student walked into a classroom building and murdered a science professor with a gun. The campus was on lockdown for hours. The front page of The Daily Tar Heel today consists of text messages sent to and from students during the lockdown:

An incredible and powerful design — on Mastodon, Steve Silberman called it &quot;the tombstone of democracy, courtesy of the NRA&quot;. As a nation, we&#x27;ve spent more than 20 years and trillions of dollars fighting the &quot;War on Terror&quot; but won&#x27;t do a damn thing about the self-imposed terrorism of gun violence. The people sending and receiving those texts — they are TERRIFIED. And this happens regularly in the US, in pre-schools and on college campuses alike. We are a sick nation.

                  <p>When&#x27;s the last time I let you down? Ok, maybe don&#x27;t answer that. But, when I tell you that a short film about the hand gestures used by a quarry boss guiding massive excavators harvesting marble is well worth watching, you&#x27;re gonna go ahead and watch it, right? Because this is a beautiful little film.
I was so taken by the chief, watching him work. How he can move gigantic marble blocks using enormous excavators, but his own movements are light, precise and determined.

	
Notice the tips of two fingers are missing. That&#x27;s how you get to be the boss. More hand gestures: hand signals used by traders on the floor of the NY Mercantile Exchange, nightclub hand signals, hand signals at Eleven Madison Park, and church usher hand signals. (via digg)

                  <p>Oh, this is delightful: a short documentary about a group of Mayan women in the tiny town of Hondzonot in the Yucatan peninsula who formed a softball team called Las Diablillas (Little Devils).
As a girl, Ay Ay loved playing sports at school. But, when she asked her parents&#x27; permission to go out and play after school, they would say no — that only boys could do so. The custom in Hondzonot was that girls would stay busy inside, get married (some as young as twelve or thirteen), and have a family. Ay Ay always thought differently, she told me, but she had no choice but to obey her parents, and later her husband. One day, a mobile health unit came to town, and the doctor taught some local women to play softball with a wooden stick and a tennis ball, as a way to combat the risks of diabetes an…</p>

                  <p>Ahh, it seems like only yesterday that I read the news about David Fincher&#x27;s upcoming film The Killer. And it was. So now here&#x27;s the teaser trailer — interest piqued. What will tomorrow bring?
The Killer stars Michael Fassbender and will make its premiere at the Venice Film Festival on Sept 3, then a limited release in theaters, and then will be streaming on Netflix on Nov 10. As a refresher, here&#x27;s what Fincher has been up to lately-ish: directed Mank (2020) &amp; Mindhunter (2017-2019), executive produced Voir and Love, Death &amp; Robots (also directed one episode). Fun Fincher Facts: he was apparently an assistant cameraman for Return of the Jedi and did &quot;matte photography&quot; for Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.

What a trip that must have been, to be the first person to peer microscopically into some water and observe tiny organisms swimming around. (via @JenLucPiquant)

                  <p>A McDonald&#x27;s restaurant apparently appears in season two of Loki on Disney+ and to mark the occasion, the fast food giant made a commercial featuring a number of other appearances by the brand in movies and TV, including The Office, The Fifth Element, Coming to America (&quot;They&#x27;re McDonald&#x27;s. I&#x27;m McDowell&#x27;s.&quot;), and Seinfeld. (Perhaps the most famous McDonald&#x27;s reference in cinema history, Jules&#x27; Royale with Cheese bit in Pulp Fiction, is conspicuously missing.)
The ad was created to introduce their As Featured In Meal promotion, which seems to consist of 1100-calorie meals from their usual menu paired with a packet of Sweet &#x27;N Sour Sauce with the Loki logo on it. I thought the commercial was fun and clever but that promotion is a bit Sad Meal.

                  <p>The climate crisis has hit home this year for many Americans — its effects have been nearly inescapable in most parts of the country. With that, writes Bill McKibben, has come a sense of unease about the future, particularly about the places we live and will be able to live.
Drawing on his experience as a Vermonter, McKibben argues that no place is truly safe from the effects of the climate crisis, but we can find protection from it by rebuilding our sense of community and social trust. Those things can provide the resilience we&#x27;re going to need to get though this.
We&#x27;ve come through 75 years where having neighbors was essentially optional: if you had a credit card, you could get everything you needed to survive dropped off at your front door. But the next 75 years aren&#x27;t going to be like that; we&#x27;re going to need to return to the basic human experience of relying on the people around you. We&#x27;re going to need to rediscover that we&#x27;re a social species, which for Americans will be hard — at least since Reagan we&#x27;ve been told to think of ourselves first and foremost (it was his pal Margaret Thatcher who insisted &#x27;there is no such thing as society, only individual men and women.&quot;) And in the Musk/Trump age we&#x27;re constantly instructed to distrust everyone and everything, a corrosion that erodes the social fabric as surely as a rampaging river erodes a highway.

                  <p>Swiss Post has released a stamp that features concrete, an important material in the history of architecture. But first of all, look at the aesthetics of this thing:

Aaahhh, it looks so nice and clean and Swiss. Love it. Even better: the stamp was designed to feel like concrete:
To give the concrete wall depicted in the design a tactile dimension, cement pigments were added to the ultra-matt finish.


In 2021, Swiss Post made a stamp out of canvas for the same series of stamps regarding art. Not quite as aesthetically pleasing as the concrete one, but still pretty cool.
You can order the concrete stamp from the Swiss Post online shop. (via greg.org)

                  <p>Now that the 2024 election campaigns have ramped up in earnest (absurdly &amp; obscenely more than a year before the actual election), a good thing to keep in mind is NYU journalism professor Jay Rosen&#x27;s guidance for how journalists should cover the election:1
&quot;Not the odds, but the stakes.&quot;
That&#x27;s my shorthand for the organizing principle we most need from journalists covering the 2024 election. Not who has what chances of winning, but the consequences for our democracy. Not the odds, but the stakes.


Rosen first articulated this principle more than a decade ago and ever since reading about it a few years ago, I&#x27;ve all but stopped reading and linking to political horse race coverage. Who scored more &quot;points&quot; in the latest debate? Which candidate seems the most Presidential? Will his mugshot bolster his campaign? Come on, this isn&#x27;t the goddamned Oscars red carpet. Tell us what the candidates&#x27; plans are and how they will affect how Americans live their lives. What experience do they have in governance? Or if not governance, in leadership? What do they believe, what actions have they taken in the past and what consequences have those actions had on actual people? What motivates them...power, money, fame, service? Many many people will not give a shit about any of this, but if we want to retain a functioning democracy with a press that&#x27;s not primarily about entertainment, voters need to know what they are getting into.

And I would argue, how they should cover many other important issues. So much of &quot;tech&quot; news reads like horse race coverage instead of focusing what kind of world would result if Company A or Technology B were to succeed. Journalists and outlets that cover the stakes get my attention.↩

Whenever I see people buying flowers I always assume they&#x27;re for a lost loved one. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve told you that already. After Tia was born, after Tia died, after we lost her, people sent us flowers. Flowers to morn. Flowers brought life into our home when, thirteen years ago, it was so desperately missing.
At the start it was an abundance, as the months went on, understandably there were less. On her first birthday year, more flowers arrived. Reminding me of life, love and loveliness after loss.
At some point, Julie and I signed up to getting flowers delivered weekly. In a way, to me, it was Tia&#x27;s …</p>

                  <p>From Dell Cameron and Andrew Couts in Wired, Trump&#x27;s Prosecution Is America&#x27;s Last Hope:
The Trump administration&#x27;s ever-broadening palette of ethics violations caused Americans to realize, perhaps for the first time on a national scale, that truly there are few if any laws against some of the most basic forms of corruption; that, instead, conventions and norms — an honor system, essentially — is all that stand between presidents and the gross abuse of their power.


This is a good, short piece, riffing off of the 2018 book by Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt, How Democracies Die. The Republicans, Trump, the Supreme Court, billionaires, corporations, and corporate shareholders are using America&#x27;s legal system to substantially weaken our democracy. It&#x27;s not a new thing for the powerful to place themselves above the law, but the pace and openness with which it&#x27;s happening right now is alarming.

                  <p>On July 4, 2023, a couple thousand people gathered in Alaska to watch old junker cars get launched off of a 300-foot cliff and just get obliterated on impact. (The launching starts at the 8-minute mark.) It&#x27;s entertaining to watch in a Jackass sort of way, but the whole thing is a metaphor for a particular facet of America: loud, dumb, fun, and wasteful.

And as you move your cursor onto the page, it suddenly disappears. Your hand may be still on the mouse, and you’re moving the mouse across the screen and across the page; but you can’t see where it is. You may or may not be hovering over a link or a button or any other form control at any moment. But if you are hovering over one, you don’t know which one it is. You could try clicking and then finding out, but you can probably already imagine what a nightmare of an experience you’re about to get into.
Unfortunately, keyboard users experience the Web in a similarly frustrating manner too often. Their equivalent of a mouse cursor is usually hidden on too many we…</p>

It holds my water admirably, sometimes even reflecting the sun in beautiful patterns. If I should tap it, it has a lovely ring to it. But when I put this glass on the shelf and the wind knocks it over or my elbow brushes it off the table and it falls to the ground and shatters, I say, &#x27;Of course.&#x27; When I understand that the glass is already broken, every moment with it is precious.&quot;

[Brief newsletter colophon interlude because I know people will be curious: I recently moved the newsletter from Mailchimp because it was too expensive, kinda janky for media-ish newsletters, and also they are owned by Intuit now. 👎 I switched to Sendy, which is a locally installed program that sends mail through Amazon&#x27;s SES.
If you&#x27;re looking for a new home for your newsletter, Sendy might not be a good choice if you don&#x27;t want to install software on a server, but I have heard great things about Buttondown and good things about beehiiv. Try to avoid Substack.]

                  <p>Right now, the Portland, OR area is suffering through a heat wave, with high temperatures some 20-25°F above normal. Earlier this year, meteorologist Guy Walton began naming North American heatwaves after oil companies:
Obviously, I&#x27;m naming heatwaves to highlight this worsening climate problem and perhaps save lives by getting the public to focus on this weather threat. This year I&#x27;m naming major heatwaves after oil companies to shame them in the process and to identify culprits that are exacerbating these deadly systems.


Portland&#x27;s hot spell, the fourth heatwave of the summer, is named Heatwave Citgo...having been preceded by Heatwave Amoco, Heatwave BP, and Heatwave Chevron. Next up on the list:
5. Conoco (Phillips)
And several more as needed. Here&#x27;s Walton&#x27;s criteria for choosing what constitutes a nameable heatwave (mirroring the scale for hurricanes):
CAT 3: A major level heatwave severe enough such that a few fatalities are reported. A city in a CAT 3 heat wave would be under a heat emergency for a few days. Many heat records would be either tied or broken.
A CAT3 or higher heatwave would be considered to be a major heatwave and would get a fossil fuel corporation name.


The highest category of heatwave is CAT5:
CAT 5. Catastrophic heat wave. Many all-time temperature records would be shattered with thousands of deaths reported. Remember the European heat wave of 2003 in which there were well in excess of 10,000 fatalities? This event would certainly fit my CAT 5 category.


The media should actually start using these more widely. (via @dens)

This blew my mind a little, particularly starting around the 3:00 mark, where she actually starts to be more fluid in her singing. (via @anotherny)
Update: See also Tuvan throat singing, Inuk throat singer Tanya Tagaq (who posted a photo online of her infant daughter next to a dead seal, a &quot;sealfie&quot;), and many other cultures who practice overtone singing. (thx, @bmcnely, @ChrisWalks1 &amp; james)

                  <p>This is a lovely, mesmerizing short video made by artist Catherine Chalmers in collaboration with some leafcutter ants. I&#x27;m not gonna say why, but you should watch this all the way to the end...there&#x27;s a bit of a twist that&#x27;ll make you smile.
Earlier this year, Chalmers was the subject of a profile in the New Yorker:
The work encourages us to empathize with bugs. One reason they disgust us, Chalmers believes, is that they seem immoral, or at least differently moral. &quot;We see ourselves as individuals,&quot; she said. &quot;And we see insects as being this uniform, formless mass that will sacrifice themselves and do all these sorts of things.&quot; Some of her photos capture a praying mantis eating the head of her mate. &quot;Civilization is a march for greater and greater and greater control over the world,&quot; she said. But nature doesn&#x27;t play by our rules.


You can more of Chalmers&#x27; collabs with ants and other insects on her website and Instagram. She&#x27;s also spoken about her work at a National Geographic Conference and at a TEDx event. (thx, andy)

                  <p>The other day when I posted about iconic hip-hop samples from the past 50 years, I noticed a name that featured prominently in the early years: Sylvia Robinson. Robinson was the CEO and co-founder of the very first rap record label, Sugar Hill Records. She produced the first rap record, Rapper&#x27;s Delight, and the seminal The Message, widely regarded as one of the best and most influential rap and hip-hop tracks ever.
From an essay written on the occasion of her induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2022:
Sylvia Robinson played many roles in the music world — artist, producer, and, most notably, record executive. But as the founder and leader of the pioneering Sugar Hill label, she revealed herself to be something even rarer. She was a visionary.
In 1979, &quot;Rapper&#x27;s Delight&quot; by the Sugarhill Gang introduced hip-hop to the global mainstream, illustrating the genre&#x27;s commercial and creative potential. Robinson had overseen the record&#x27;s backing track, assembled the group members, and arranged their vocals — but fundamentally, it was her idea that rap was even viable as recorded music. Her place in history would be secured by that track alone, though it was far from her only impact on the direction of pop.


Here&#x27;s a short video that covers the high points of her career:

It&#x27;s sad that Robinson and her achievements haven&#x27;t been more widely known — this seems like another case (as in computing and other industries) where women played an early vital role and were then forgotten.

In the game, you fly &amp; glide around, navigating different terrain to achieve various goals and objectives. I&#x27;ve been playing it for the last few days and it&#x27;s a really fun, chill game. Basically, if you loved either Alto game, you&#x27;ll enjoy this.
Laya&#x27;s Horizon is available on iOS and Android and is free to play if you have a Netflix account. Did you know Netflix had a gaming service? (thx, patrick)

                  <p>The Illustrated Book of Poultry by Lewis Wright, first published in 1870 and revised several times in the decades following, was &quot;regarded as the most desirable of the English poultry books&quot;. Poultry was very popular in Victorian England and the book housed a tremendous amount of practical poultry knowledge. From a Harvard Library blog post:
&quot;Hen Fever&quot;, as it became known during the Victorian Age, was an unprecedented obsession with owning, breeding, and showing the finest chickens in the world. The genesis of the poultry fancier owes much to Queen Victoria and her royal menagerie. In 1842, she acquired exotic chickens from China, and whatever the Queen did, the public would soon try to imitate and incorporate at home. The Illustrated London News reported &quot;Her Majesty&#x27;s collection of fowls is very considerable, occupying half-a-dozen very extensive yards, several small fields, and numerous feeding-houses, laying-sheds, hospitals, winter courts, &amp;c.&quot;. From this point forward, poultry was no longer viewed as common farmyard critters, but valued and appreciated throughout the classes of Victorian Britain. The import and breeding of poultry was not just a leisurely hobby, but a profitable endeavor with sky rocketing price tags for the finest examples.

	
But the books also contained many wonderful illustrations of the finest examples of chickens and other poultry in the style of Audubon. The different breeds have amazing names like Buff Orpingtons, Plymouth Rocks, Dark Dorkingtons, and Gold Pencilled Hamburghs.
I pulled the images above from a 1911 edition of the book. (via @john_overholt)
Update: I removed a link to a reproduction of the book on Amazon because a reader reported that the quality was not great. (thx, alex)

                  </ul>
                  <p>Alexey Molchanov, one of the best freedivers of all time, recently set two new world records at a competition at Dean&#x27;s Blue Hole in the Bahamas:
An FIM dive that took 4m 42s and went to a depth of 133 meters (442 feet). Molchanov pulled himself down and up using a guide rope without fins.
A CWT dive that took 4m 13s and went to a depth of 133 meters (442 feet). CWT is when the diver uses a monofin and weight belt to dive and return to the surface.

His complete record-breaking dives are embedded above and are completely suspenseful to watch even though you know the outcome. They&#x27;re almost like watching someone meditate instead of compete in an extreme sport. Molchanov needs to expend some energy and oxygen getting down and back, but also can&#x27;t over-exert himself. A lot of it is just being relaxed and calm — this is truly a mind-over-matter discipline.
I&#x27;ve written about Molchanov before,1 riffing off of this profile of him in GQ.
When Alexey was younger, his mother, Natalia Molchanova, was the world&#x27;s best freediver, a distinction that she held for many years. She was a pioneer in the sport and the practitioner of a mind-and-body-control technique called &quot;attention deconcentration.&quot; She passed her secrets to her son, who perfected them and uses the regimen to reach a state of intense calm. By doing so, he can slow his heart rate, his metabolic rate, while simultaneously slowing the activity of his brain and his body. His focus deepens. He relaxes to the point of seeming asleep. He takes deep, drowsy breaths, like a summer breeze filling a sail.


I will never not be fascinated by freediving.

And his mother Natalia, who was probably the best freediver ever and taught Alexey how. Natalia disappeared while diving in 2015 and is presumed dead.↩

                  <p>Tom Scott visits the small Swiss ski town of Zermatt, where petrol cars have never been allowed. In the 1980s, the town skipped right from horse-drawn carriages to locally-built electric vehicles, which are made pretty much by hand and are expensive — but they are also easy to maintain and repair and can last for 30-50 years. Because space is at a premium, the town tightly controls who can own a vehicle and most of allowed vehicles are delivery vans, public transportation, or other vehicles with a communal use.

                  <p>In the Scope of Work newsletter, Anna and Kelly Pendergrast look at various trade secrets and secret ingredients — some that are still necessary, and others that are merely legendary.
When Chicago&#x27;s Vienna Sausage Company moved from its original premises which were &quot;put together in a Rube Goldberg kind of arrangement&quot; to a brand new state-of-the-art facility, the sausages didn&#x27;t taste as good. For a year and a half, the company tried to work out the problem to no avail. One day, workers were reminiscing about an ex-employee, Irving, who didn&#x27;t come to work at the new factory due to the long commute required. Irving&#x27;s job was to move the sausages from the filling room to the smokehouse, taking them on a half hour journey through a maze of rooms where other products were getting produced. After noting this absence, it clicked that Irving&#x27;s daily trip was the secret ingredient — on his journey the sausages were getting pre-cooked and infused with flavor. The company was eventually able to recreate the sausages&#x27; original taste, building a brand new room onto the factory which emulated the properties of Irving&#x27;s trip.

                  <p>Craig Mod has my favorite take to date on Oppenheimer: that it should have been more like Richard Rhodes&#x27; The Making of the Atomic Bomb:
My ideal version of this film would have begun in the 1900s or &#x27;10s, with flashes of Relativity and then the steps of Quantum Mechanics with Planck, Bohr, and Heisenberg. Quantum tunneling with Gamow and Gurney. The nuclear shell model with Maria Goeppert Mayer and J. Hans D. Jensen. Chadwick&#x27;s discovery of the neutron. Anderson&#x27;s positron unveiling. Hold the camera longer on Lawrence and his cyclotron. What&#x27;s going on there? (I mean, ya got Josh Hartnett&#x27;s pretty head, plaster it up!) Shoot in high-grade mega-IMAX-bokeh the oddly simple experimental setups, the beakers, the blips, the radiation tick-tick-ticks, the iterations, the step-by-step expansion of understanding the fabric of everything around us. Give us an hour of this, this arguably greatest moment of human insight. You can still call the film Oppenheimer. Let the man loom, weave him between it all as he makes his way through Europe, sets up at Berkeley, is selected to lead Los Alamos. Ramp up the Nazi threat. Show the diaspora of brilliance more clearly. Believe the audience is willing to sit through more than just &quot;Is it a wave ... or is it particle?&quot; Oh! There is so much excitement, so much incredible science to be mined, and Nolan mined so little.


Mod and I both share a love for that masterpiece of a book and I would watch the hell out of an 10-part HBO series (in the vein of Chernobyl) based on it, American Prometheus, and John Hersey&#x27;s Hiroshima.

                  <p>Produced by Venus &amp; Serena Williams and US soccer star Alex Morgan and directed by Rachel Ramsay &amp; James Erskine, Copa 71 is a forthcoming documentary about a women&#x27;s soccer tournament that took place in Mexico City in 1971 that was the first, albeit unofficial, Women&#x27;s World Cup. A short teaser trailer is above. From a piece in Variety about the film:
In August 1971, more than 100,000 football fans packed Mexico City&#x27;s Azteca Stadium for a historic tournament. Teams from England, France, Denmark, Argentina and Italy flew in for 21 days of matches alongside Mexico&#x27;s national team, while eager sponsors lined up for a piece of the action. The players, who received a hero&#x27;s welcome wherever they went, might as well have been the Rolling Stones.
They were, in fact, a group of around 100 women — many of them teenagers — taking part in a pioneering unofficial Women&#x27;s World Cup. And just as quickly as they tasted fame, it was snatched away as the tournament was all but erased from football history.


Many of the competitors were just teenagers — from Wikipedia:
England&#x27;s team included 13-year-old Leah Caleb, 14-year-old Gill Sayell, and 15-year-old Chris Lockwood; their captain was 19-year-old Carol Wilson and they were accompanied by referee Pat Dunn as a chaperone and trainer. 15-year-old Susanne Augustesen scored a hat-trick for Denmark as they beat Mexico 3-0 in the final.


Copa 71 is premiering at the Toronto Film Festival in September and then hopefully will find its way into theaters and onto streaming. (thx, meg)

                  <p>From Greg Maletic, glamour shots of his collection of calculators from 1968-1983 (and here).
In the 1970s, calculators weren&#x27;t just for calculating. They were luxury items. In a world before iPods and iPhones, calculators were the first aspirational personal electronics.
Calculators 1968-1983 showcases these remarkable design objects, along with stories behind why they look and operate the way they do. And how, in just a few decades, one of the world&#x27;s most important products went from indispensable to irrelevant.


You can see the collection in person next weekend in Portland...details are here.
Oh, and if the design of the calculator in the last photo above looks somewhat familiar, the Calculator app on the original iPhone was based on a similar model from Braun. (via @cabel)

                  <p>I started using Mastodon back in November, and it’s the Twitter alternative
where I’ve been spending most of my time recently, mostly because the Fediverse
is where a lot of the Linux nerds seem to be right now.
I’ve found Mastodon quite a bit more confusing than Twitter because it’s a
distributed system, so here are a few technical things I’ve learned about it
over the last 10 months. I’ll mostly talk about what using a single-person
server has been like for me, as well as a couple of notes about the API, DMs
and ActivityPub.
I might have made some mistakes, please let me know if I’ve gotten anything
wrong!
what’s a mastodon instance?
First: Mastodon is a decentralized collection of independently run servers
instead of One Big Server. The software is open source.

With dozens of the tiny birds buzzing overhead, along walls and the window of her bedroom, Lattouf explained that she began caring for them a year after surviving colon cancer in 2011. It started with one hummingbird that had an eye injured by another bird.
A veterinarian friend encouraged her to try to help it. She named it Gucci after the brand of the glasses case she kept it in. The bird became her inseparable companion, perching on her computer screen while she worked.
&quot;It wrote me a new life,&quot; she said of the nine months the bird lived with her.


I&#x27;m not entirely sure I&#x27;d like 60 hummingbirds constantly flitting around my house, but I&#x27;m not entirely sure I wouldn&#x27;t like that either.

                  <p>I think this might be my favorite Every Frame a Painting yet: Taylor Ramos and Tony Zhou explore how a film editor does what she does. Or as Zhou puts it, &quot;how does an editor think and feel?&quot; The point about emotions taking time is especially interesting, as is the accompanying comparison between similar scenes from The Empire Strikes Back and Ant Man.
Emotions take time. When we watch people onscreen, we feel a connection to them. And that&#x27;s because we have time to watch their faces before they speak and time to watch them afterwards. Editors have to decide, &quot;how much time do I give this emotion?&quot;

                  <p>Madeline Miller (Circe, Song of Achilles) got sick in February 2020 with what turned out to be Covid, which then turned into Long Covid. It has profoundly affected her life (gift link).
I reached out to doctors. One told me I was &quot;deconditioned&quot; and needed to exercise more. But my usual jog left me doubled over, and when I tried to lift weights, I ended up in the ER with chest pains and tachycardia. My tests were normal, which alarmed me further. How could they be normal? Every morning, I woke breathless, leaden, utterly depleted.
Worst of all, I couldn&#x27;t concentrate enough to compose sentences. Writing had been my haven since I was 6. Now, it was my family&#x27;s livelihood. I kept looking through my pre-covid novel drafts, desperately trying to prod my sticky, limp brain forward. But I was to…</p>

                  <p>A short TED-Ed video on the flow state of creativity and how you might enter it more easily.
Flow is more than just concentrating or paying attention; it&#x27;s a unique mental state of effortless engagement. And those who more frequently experience flow report higher levels of positive emotions, creativity, and feelings of accomplishment. But what exactly is flow? And how can we find it in our daily lives? Explore steps you can take to increase your chances of finding flow.


While I am not feeling particularly in the groove today, over the past several weeks I&#x27;ve been in the flow state a lot, working on a couple of projects for the site. It&#x27;s been a long time since I&#x27;ve had that feeling for more than a couple of hours every few months and booooooy does it feel good. There is almost nothing that fills me with as much joy as the &quot;effortless engagement&quot; of being in the flow state. I&#x27;m very glad it&#x27;s back in my life — I&#x27;d been afraid it was gone forever. (via open culture)

They&#x27;re from a series called 33 Spaceships for Another Planet but she&#x27;s been doing these diagrammatic/picographic paintings and drawings for some time now. It&#x27;s fun to back through Knight&#x27;s older work and see how her ancient yet futuristic style evolved. Here&#x27;s my best stab at a succinct description of her aesthetic: imagine Hilma af Klint as the production designer for Wes Anderson&#x27;s Stargate.

                  <p>This short, relaxing, mesmerizing video of an Martian impact crater called Aram Chaos was taken by the HiRISE camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The images were run through an enhanced color red-green-blue filter, which tends to highlight the structure and geology rather than the true color. For example, the blue in the video often represents basalt, an igneous rock of volcanic origin.

                  <p>You know me; I love a good book cover. The AIGA&#x27;s annual roundup of the best designed books and covers is usually aces and the results of the 2022 competition (announced at the beginning of July 2023) is no exception. Here are a few I picked out that I didn&#x27;t feature in The Best Book Covers of 2022 back in December.




Uh, I guess I&#x27;m really into orange today? Anyway, these covers are from:
Butts: A Backstory by Heather Radke.
Sound Within Sound: Radical Composers of the Twentieth Century by Kate Molleson.
Sabit Fikir by Paul Valéry.
No hay nadie en casa by Isabel Díaz Alanís.

                  <p>Sometimes I talk to friends who need to use the command line, but are
intimidated by it. I never really feel like I have good advice (I’ve been using
the command line for too long), and so I asked some people on Mastodon:
if you just stopped being scared of the command line in the last year or
three — what helped you?
(no need to reply if you don’t remember, or if you’ve been using the command
line comfortably for 15 years — this question isn’t for you :) )
This list is still a bit shorter than I would like, but I’m posting it in the
hopes that I can collect some more answers. There obviously isn’t one single
thing that works for everyone – different people take different paths.
I think there are two parts to getting comfortable: motivation and resources. I’ll

                  <p>Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&amp;M, says that the most likely way people will be impacted by the climate crisis won&#x27;t be with some big disaster but with a bunch of small changes that add up to something unmanageable.
Let me give you an example of a tiny impact that I just heard about. My wife told me about a new group of members at her gym: active 70-ish-year-olds who used to go on walks around their neighborhood. Due to the unbearable heat in Texas, though, they joined a gym and now walk indoors on treadmills. This story embodies several aspects of climate impacts that everyone should understand.
First, this is an example of non-linear climate impacts. Although temperatures have been rising gradually over the last century, it was only recently that they crossed a critical th…</p>

                  <p>David Zipper, who researches and writes about mobility and transportation, recently did a big thread on Mastodon (and Bluesky) about car bloat: the way in which cars and trucks have gotten much bigger and heavier in the US over the past few decades and how it&#x27;s bad for society. The whole thread is worth a read...here are a couple of Zipper&#x27;s points:
Tall vehicles have bigger blind spots and are more likely to strike a person&#x27;s torso or head. Heavier vehicles exert more force crashing into a person, bicycle, or smaller car. They also have longer braking distances.



Heavier cars exert more pressure on tires, eroding them faster. Tire particles are absorbed into water, where they damage ecosystems. They also float through the air, harming human health when ingested.


For further reading, Zipper links to a number of pieces he&#x27;s written in recent months: The Blatant Greenwashing of SUVs, EVs Are Sending Toxic Tire Particles Into the Water, Soil, and Air, Carry That Weight, and The Car Safety Feature That Kills the Other Guy. Zipper&#x27;s solution to these problems is government action: for example, taxing vehicles by weight, testing vehicles for pedestrian and cyclist safety, or requiring drivers have commercial driver&#x27;s licenses for larger vehicles.

                  <p>Scrabble is one of those games where pro/expert gameplay differs so much from amateur/novice gameplay that it might as well be a totally different game. In this entertaining recap of the finals of the 2023 Scrabble World Championships, former US champ Will Anderson explains how finalists David Eldar and Harshan Lamabadusuriya think and strategize throughout the best-of-seven series.
Gameplay aside, the thing that stood out for me is how many of the words played I&#x27;d just never heard of before. Like, at least 60% of them. Like I said, it&#x27;s just a completely different game at the expert level, with a shit-ton of memorization required. I don&#x27;t play Scrabble for this reason — because if you don&#x27;t have a bunch of two-letter words and Q,Z, &amp; X words memorized and you&#x27;re playing against someone who does, it&#x27;s not fun. But it is fun to see two heavyweights of the game go at it on equal terms. (via peterme)

                  <p>Someone recently asked me – “how do you deal with writing in public? People on
the internet are such assholes!”
I’ve often heard the advice “don’t read the comments”, but actually I’ve
learned a huge amount from reading internet comments on my posts from strangers
over the years, even if sometimes people are jerks. So I want to explain some
tactics I use to try to make the comments on my posts more informative and
useful to me, and to try to minimize the number of annoying comments I get.
talk about facts
On here I mostly talk about facts – either facts about computers, or stories
about my experiences using computers.
For example this post about tcpdump contains some basic facts about how to use tcpdump,
as well as an example of how I’ve used it in the past.
Talking about facts means I get…</p>

I’m writing this post sleepless and with a headache, which I find is the best way to write posts, because it removes all the verbal guardrails, so, be forewarned.
Back in 2016, a year before recorded history, I stole a simple idea: What if I wrote a bot to reply to spammers, pretending to be interested in their wares, and wasting their time?
After some creating this, it turned out that it was possible, and Spamnesty was born.
Spamnesty was cleverly disguised as a company, Mnesty, LLC, Asia’s premier maritime logistics company, strategically located in the land-locked Mongolia.
Of course, this didn’t tip spammers off that the whole thing was fake, because why would they even care to look at the site?
This resulted in untold amounts of entertainment, whiling the small hours of the morning away, reading about the likes of the hapless Abdullah Ishaq, whose attempt of selling LedTrading.com to my bot did not</p>

(This goes double and triple for Instagram and TikTok.) Alan Becker has over 23 million subscribers and makes videos pitting animated characters against various other entities. His latest video is Animation vs. Math and it is super nerdy and engaging. You might have to be a bit of a math nerd to enjoy this fully, but even if you only get the gist of what&#x27;s going on (like I did for at least half of the video), it&#x27;s still pretty entertaining. You can check the comments for an explanation of the math or this illustrated explainer.

                  <p>Today I was thinking about – what happens when you run a simple “Hello World”
Python program on Linux, like this one?
print(&quot;hello world&quot;)

Here’s what it looks like at the command line:
$ python3 hello.py
hello world

But behind the scenes, there’s a lot more going on. I’ll
describe some of what happens, and (much much more importantly!) explain some tools you can use to
see what’s going on behind the scenes yourself. We’ll use readelf, strace,
ldd, debugfs, /proc, ltrace, dd, and stat. I won’t talk about the Python-specific parts at all – just what happens when you run any dynamically linked executable.
Here’s a table of contents:

                  <p>In a June piece for The Guardian and the video above from just a few days ago, Robert Reich outlines five crises — including wokeness, the trans panic, and critical race theory — that Republicans have manufactured in order to deflect from their true agenda. 
Virginia governor Glenn Youngkin&#x27;s &quot;day one&quot; executive order banned the teaching of critical race theory. DeSantis and Greg Abbott, the Texas governor, have also banned it from schools.
Here again, though, there&#x27;s no evidence of a public threat. CRT simply teaches America&#x27;s history of racism, which students need to understand to be informed citizens.
Banning it is a scare tactic to appeal to a largely white, culturally conservative voter base.


However, I would argue that Reich needed to go a bit further. While the crises are inventions, their consequences go beyond mere distraction and into the territory of active harm, particularly of queer and trans people, Black people, and people of color. That&#x27;s why I modified the title from his original.

                  <p>In the 1994 Caribbean Cup qualifying group stage match between Barbados and Grenada, the 90 minutes of normal time ended with an intentional own goal by Barbados and then with Grenada trying to score either a goal or an own goal and Barbados defending both nets. Say what?! How did this happen?
Well, it was the confluence of a few things:
The match would go into overtime in case of a tie.
The &quot;golden goal&quot; rule was in effect for overtime...the first goal wins and the match is immediately over. Oh, and the goal is worth 2 goals, not just one.



To qualify for the next round, Barbados not only needed to win the match, they needed to win it by two goals...a one-goal difference would not be enough.

I found out about the match by reading this SBNation article but Wikipedia does a better job in…</p>

                  <p>From Adam Kovacs&#x27; YouTube channel Adam Something comes this brisk 10-minute video essay on why European malls are doing better than their American progenitors. I thought his third point, about poor urban planning, was particularly interesting: malls tend to fail in America because they are not integrated into the fabric of towns and cities (because very little is integrated into the fabric of cities and towns in many places these days).
Malls, hell, all commerce has to be an organic part of towns and cities. People should be able to get to them by means other than a car, and conveniently. Such integrated commercial spaces are far more resilient. If your commercial spaces aren&#x27;t resilient — if you just plop a big box outside the town — don&#x27;t be surprised when it goes bust in a few years. And then it&#x27;s bulldozed for the next thing to be put up for it to go bust the same way and then get bulldozed and then the next thing and the next and the next so on and so forth.

                  <p>As you may know, this summer I am leading the design of the inaugural State of HTML survey.
Naturally, I am also exploring ways to improve both survey UX, as well as all questions.
Shaine Madala, a data scientist working on the survey design team proposed using numerical inputs instead of brackets for the income question.
While I was initially against it,
I decided to explore this a bit further, which changed my opinion.
There are actually four demographics questions in State of X surveys where the answer is essentially a number, yet we ask respondents to select a bracket:
age, years of experience, company size, and income.
The arguments for brackets are:
They are more privacy preserving for sensitive questions (e.g. people may feel more comfortable sharing an income bracket than their act…</p>

                  <p>Starting with Jaws, his first big blockbuster movie that defined the genre, Steven Spielberg has filled the audiences of his films with a sense of wonder, that alchemical mix of fear and astonishment of the unknown. No other director does it better and this video essay explores how he does it.

                  <p>The music for Sinéad O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s 1990 smash hit Nothing Compares 2 U is already pretty stripped down to emphasize the vocals, but in this video, the vocals are almost fully isolated so you can really hear the clarity and emotion in that wonderful voice of hers.
The song was apparently recorded in one take:
&quot;I actually think the intensity of Sinéad&#x27;s performance came from the breakup of her latest relationship,&quot; opines Chris Birkett, who co-produced and engineered the track as well as the accompanying, Grammy Award-winning album, I Do Not Want What I Haven&#x27;t Got, which topped the Billboard 200 for six weeks and sold seven million copies worldwide. &quot;She had been dating her manager, Fachtna O&#x27;Ceallaigh, who&#x27;s a really good guy and had been instrumental in getting her deal with Ensign Records. However, their relationship had gone pear-shaped and they were in the process of breaking up when we recorded &#x27;Nothing Compares 2 U&#x27;, so that&#x27;s probably why she did such a good vocal. She came into the studio, did it in one take, double-tracked it straight away and it was perfect because she was totally into the song. It mirrored her situation.&quot;

                  <p>A NYC DJ named Dwells released this mashup of Radiohead&#x27;s Everything In Its Right Place and Kendrick Lamar&#x27;s N95 back in March and I love it:

You can also find it on Soundcloud and Bandcamp. I ran across it when Radiohead shared a snippet of it on TikTok.
FWIW, Dwells seems to be the same DJ Dwells that won the NYC regional of the prestigious DMC DJ competition when he was just 13 years old. (via @jessicabrillhart)

Heather Cox Richardson lays it out in plain English:
The Trump team used lies about the election to justify organizing fraudulent slates of electors in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Allegedly with the help of Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel, they attempted to have the legitimate electors that accurately reflected the voters&#x27; choice of Biden replaced with fraudulent ones that claimed Trump had won in their states, first by convincing state legislators they had the …</p>

                  <p>Cruise ships are a relatively new human invention that look quite different from other ships. Oh, and they are absolutely massive. How did they get that way?
The predecessor of today&#x27;s cruise ships was the ocean liner: big, beautiful ships that sailed across the Atlantic. But ocean liners had a totally different purpose from cruise ships: They were for transportation. Everything about them was designed to facilitate an ocean voyage from one continent to another.
But air travel changed that. Planes eliminated the main reason to take a ship somewhere, and ocean liner business plummeted. So the industry pivoted and began selling a ship as the destination itself. The cruise ship was born. But the ocean liners, built for a voyage, weren&#x27;t ideal for the purposes of a cruise, and over the next few decades, the cruise ship began its evolution. And it has culminated in the behemoths we see today.


Cruise ships always make me think of David Foster Wallace&#x27;s classic piece, Shipping Out (which you might know as A Supposedly Fun Thing I&#x27;ll Never Do Again).

                  <p>[Note: If you&#x27;re reading/watching this, I assume you&#x27;ve watched season two or don&#x27;t care about spoilers; they abound.] The Bear is an intense show about a group of intense people doing an intense job. It can be tough to watch sometimes because people often communicate by screaming and yelling at each other. As Evan Puschak observes in this perceptive video essay, the second season delves into where some of those behaviors came from (surprise: childhood trauma) and offers a counterbalancing force: tenderness, listening, and paying attention.

                  <p>I have said previously that &quot;even on my busiest day, I will drop everything to watch a video of pencils being made&quot;. Still true! This video from Process X of a Tokyo pencil factory really hits the spot. My favorite part of watching pencils get made is always the sharpening of the finished pencils by belt sander.

We spent many quiet days in Roscoe Bay, and then wandered over to melanie cove for a few days before moving to our favorite anchorage in Desolation Sound, Hathayim Marine Park. This inlet is quiet, and not overly busy, it is ideal for focusing on projects. We walk the 3 km trail to Squirrel Cove everyday.
We have been hard at work reviewing Wiktopher, and we&#x27;re happy to announce that we&#x27;ve finished the first pass of corrections! We&#x27;ll be doing many more passes, but this was a very big step. Rek has been drawing(Mastodon) a lot, and Devine has been working on their presentation for Strange Loop 2023.

                  <p>I&#x27;ve gotta say that I was a little skeptical when Phil Edwards started out this video saying that he wasn&#x27;t going to talk about Pac-Man&#x27;s gameplay as a vital component of why it was such a huge success when in came out in 1980. He allows that, of course, the gameplay was very compelling but other factors truly pushed the game beyond the competition and into its own category, including the decline of pinball (profit per square foot), its family friendliness, and some legal &amp; financial maneuverings.
Oh, and here&#x27;s the playable keychain-sized Pac-Man that you can see in the video. Didn&#x27;t even know that was a thing!

                  <p>Mastodon is easy and fun except when it isn&#x27;t. Erin Kissane asked folks why they had disengaged from Mastodon; they described reasons like a hostile response from regulars, poor discoverability, and too serious/boring.
A bleak account of a Greyhound bus ride across the US. &quot;Gone are the small, clean, cheap motels in the centre of cities, gone are public spaces where anyone can find a water fountain, a bathroom, a place to nurse a cheap cup of coffee and human company.&quot;

Rules for design in the real world: &quot;If it looks neat, people will want to take a photo with it. If it looks comfortable, people will want to sit on it. If it looks fun, people will play around on it.&quot;

                  <p>The roots of hip-hop and rap are various and stretch back in time to the antebellum South and from there to Africa. But by some accounts, a song called Noah by gospel group The Jubalaires was the first instance of recorded music that sounded like rap. Listen for yourself...the relevant bit is right around the 35-second mark:

I&#x27;m not a music historian by any stretch, but that sounds 30 years ahead of its time. There are several bad remixes of Noah on YouTube...this one is maybe the best at pairing their singing with a rap beat.

                  <p>Designed by Olson Kundig Architects, the Maxon House features a studio that&#x27;s attached to the main house but can be rolled away on railroad tracks to be closer to the trees. From Dezeen:
The two-storey structure was based on the design of the &quot;traditional caboose&quot;. A workspace sits on the first level while the second, accessible via a steel ladder, serves as a cupola for taking in views and functions as a &quot;calmer zone for creative exploration and restoration&quot;.
The control panel that operates the rails was taken from a Burlington Northern locomotive, while the door colour and the wood used were directly informed by colours and materials commonly found on American trains.
The railroad ties for the track were repurposed from the Great Northern Railroad line, though the studio noted the steel tracks &quot;are a much larger gauge than is typically used&quot;.


There&#x27;s even a Wes Anderson connection (because of course there is):
Inspired by Wes Anderson&#x27;s love of trains in cinema, Maxon Railway takes some visual cues in the form of on-board artifacts and props from The Darjeeling Limited.


You can read lots more about the house and the railway, including more than you&#x27;d probably want to know about the history of rail travel and commerce in the Pacific Northwest.

                  <p>In 2006, photographer Mark Preuschl recreated Georges Seurat&#x27;s famous impressionist painting A Sunday on La Grande Jatte in Beloit, WI with a group of volunteers. Here&#x27;s the original for reference:

From My Modern Met:
In conceiving this tableau vivant, the organizers wanted to keep things modern. Thus, all participants are wearing contemporary clothes with umbrellas substituted in for the 19th-century parasols. Though the team was organized, they weren&#x27;t quite prepared for what mother nature threw their way the day of the shoot. Preuschl recalls winds of 20 to 25 mph coming off the river, as well as clouds that didn&#x27;t allow for the shadows they were so desperately looking for. Luckily, there was a window of about 25 minutes when the sun came out and cast those shadows.


He really couldn&#x27;t have scouted that location any better...it matches the original pretty well. Who knew you could find Belle Époque Paris in southern Wisconsin?

                  <p>Rebecca Solnit, writing for The Guardian on the climate crisis:
Many things that were once true — that we didn&#x27;t have adequate solutions, that the general public wasn&#x27;t aware or engaged — no longer are. Outdated information is misinformation, and the climate situation has changed a lot in recent years. The physical condition of the planet — as this summer&#x27;s unprecedented extreme heat and flooding and Canada&#x27;s and Greece&#x27;s colossal fires demonstrate — has continued to get worse; the solutions have continued to get better; the public is far more engaged; the climate movement has grown, though of course it needs to grow far more; and there have been some significant victories as well as the incremental change of a shifting energy landscape.


I don&#x27;t think of myself as a climate doomer, but I certainly feel less hopeful about the situation than Solnit does. She asserts that the main obstacles to meaningful action on the climate crisis in the West are politics and capitalism, which is supposed to make readers feel hopeful. But that&#x27;s the part that often fills me with despair. The unpopular extremist party that controls more than half of the political apparatus in the country with the biggest responsibility to fix the planet is not only not interested in doing so, they are actively working against it. And they&#x27;ve built up such a wall against public accountability that I don&#x27;t know if protest (which they will make illegal if they can) or even voting (which they&#x27;ve fought to make more difficult) are meaningful levers with which to try and change the situation.
Ok, maybe I am a climate doomer. But this piece by Solnit is good medicine for folks in despair about the climate. And I&#x27;m putting Not Too Late: Changing the Climate Story from Despair to Possibility (edited by Solnit and climate activist Thelma Young Lutunatabua) on my reading list as well.

                  <p>This is pretty cool: in collaboration with the British Museum, a team led by woodblock printmaker David Bull (who I first wrote about back in 20051) is carving woodblocks and creating prints from a series of previously unpublished drawings by legendary Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai.
The Museum has in their possession a group of drawings by Hokusai that were apparently intended for use in the production of a series of books. For reasons unknown to us now that project was cancelled, but the drawings survived, and we have selected 12 of them for a new subscription series.
For more details of the collection of images, please refer to this page of the British Museum website. But here, we can simply note that the drawings fall into a number of categories, and our set will reflect that diversity. Hokusai&#x27;s series was intended to take his readers through aspects of Japanese historical culture, and we will meet Buddhist deities, warriors from ancient China, and historical landscapes, along with more prosaic scenes of the natural world.


The print shown above was the first one to be sent out in January. But look at this original drawing from the collection:

Wow. That is shockingly modern — like a 60s superhero comic or a still from 60s anime. I hope they reprint this one!
Here&#x27;s a video from the British Museum of Bull talking about the project:

If you make woodblock prints for a living, you know the name Hokusai, and if you&#x27;re a woodblock carver and you hear about original drawings from Hokusai that have never been carved into prints you would most likely do a little happy dance.


(via open culture)

Hooo boy, there are parts of that post that did not age well. Bull, however, is still doing his thing.↩

                  <p>In 1910, a group of inexperienced climbers claimed to have summited Denali, the highest peak in what is now the United States. Their story was greeted with skepticism.
So when I found out that the first people to reach the highest point in North America (Denali, the mountain formerly known as McKinley) were just a bunch of Average Joes with no climbing experience who went up on a bet, I was flabbergasted. How had I never heard this story? The more I looked into it, the more fantastic the story became. When these guys descended from the mountain, nobody believed they really even made it. And they wouldn&#x27;t be the first people to fraudulently claim to have reached the top, with no evidence to offer that they succeeded. This story has all the makings of a blockbuster action comedy. It&#x27;s almost unbelievable.


But later evidence suggests that they just might have made it to the top.

                  <p>I write a lot about technologies that I found hard to learn about. A
while back my friend Sumana asked me an interesting question – why are these
things so hard to learn about? Why do they seem so mysterious?
For example, take DNS. We’ve been using DNS since the 80s (for more than 35 years!). It’s
used in every website on the internet. And it’s pretty stable – in a lot of
ways, it works the exact same way it did 30 years ago.
But it took me YEARS to figure out how to confidently debug DNS issues, and
I’ve seen a lot of other programmers struggle with debugging DNS problems as
well. So what’s going on?
Here are a couple of thoughts about why learning to troubleshoot DNS problems
is hard.
(I’m not going to explain DNS very much in this post, see Implement DNS in a Weekend or my DNS blog post…</p>

                  <p>In 1842, a French artist and scholar named Joseph-Philibert Girault de Prangey set out on a tour of the eastern Mediterranean to document sights and architecture via the brand new medium of photography. He started off in what is now Italy and continued on to Greece, Egypt, Turkey, Syria, and the Levant (which includes modern-day Lebanon, Israel, and Palestine). The daguerreotypes he took are the oldest surviving photos of those locations (aside from Italy). It&#x27;s incredible to time travel back 180 years to see what these places looked like. (via aeon)

                  <p>Vox talked to four television writers about how streaming and prestige TV have changed the financial picture for writers over the past 15 years, contributing to the writers strike that&#x27;s been going on since early May.
Companies like Netflix, Hulu, Apple TV+, and more have given consumers an unprecedented array of films and TV shows and opened the door to new voices that don&#x27;t have to adhere to mainstream network formats. On the other hand, streaming has also changed how television gets produced, the role writers play, and how they get paid. We interviewed four television writers and showrunners about how streaming has changed how they work, how their incomes have taken a hit, and why it has become harder than ever to build a career.

                  <p>You have likely participated in several Devographics surveys before,
such as State of CSS, or State of JS.
These surveys have become the primary source of unbiased data for the practices of front-end developers today
(there is also the Web Almanac research, but because this studies what is actually used on the web, it takes a lot longer for changes in developer practices to propagate).
You may remember that last summer, Google sponsored me to be Survey Design Lead for State of CSS 2022.
It went really well: we got 60% higher response rate than the year before, which gave browsers a lot of actionable data to prioritize their work.
The feedback from these surveys is a prime input into the Interop project,
where browsers collaborate to implement the most important features for developers inte…</p>

                  <p>I just really love the hell out of these iterative Lego build videos from Brick Experiment Channel and Brick Technology. In this one, a car is repeatedly modified to roll perfectly on an increasingly inclined treadmill. I started watching and in 10 seconds I was 100% invested.
They&#x27;re not even really about Lego...that&#x27;s just the playful hook to get you through the door. They&#x27;re really about science and engineering — trial and error, repeated failure, iteration, small gains, switching tactics when confronted with dead ends, how innovation can result in significant advantages. Of course, none of this is unique to engineering; these are all factors in any creative endeavor — painting, sports, photography, writing, programming. But the real magic here is seeing it all happen in just a few minutes.

                  <p>Traditionally, the subjects depicted in Western art were either religious or rich — wealthy patrons paid for paintings of themselves or of their religions. As Evan Puschak explains in this brief video essay, that began to change in the 16th century as revolution, reformation, and the development of a merchant class shifted who was worthy of depiction and who could pay.

Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been watching, reading, listening to, and experiencing over the last two months.

                  <p>Stephanie Shih is a Brooklyn-based ceramic artist who makes painted sculptures of ordinary objects like food, shoes, hats, and signs. A recent exhibition focused on the overlap of immigrant communities of Asians and Jews on NYC&#x27;s Lower East Side and Chinatown.
A few yards from where the Bernstein-on-Essex sign hangs is a long table that displays Shih&#x27;s sculpted takes on other iconic food and drink, like a bilingual bottle of Soy Vay Veri Veri Teriyaki, roast pork on garlic bread, Golden Plum Chinkiang Vinegar, and a can of Dr. Brown&#x27;s Cel-Ray Soda.
&quot;A lot of my solo shows are about this idea of authenticity,&quot; says Shih, who has been working in ceramic full-time since 2015. &quot;There are no cultures that are untouched by other cultures. These are two communities that grew up alongside each other. It was not always friendly, but simply from proximity and the fact that they were the two largest non-Christian immigrant groups, they had commonalities.&quot; For example, she says, the tradition of Jews eating Chinese food on Christmas began right near Harkawik, on the Lower East Side.

                  <p>When you apply power with higher-than-normal voltage to electric kids toys, they tend to move faster. When you apply 30V instead of the usual 2.5V or 5V, they move really fast:

This reminds me of when I was in grade school. Does anyone remember Stompers? They were battery-operated cars and trucks that were bigger than HotWheels and, while not remote-controlled, were able to move around under their own power. But they weren&#x27;t that speedy...maybe they could do 1-2 mph.
Anyway, some kid at school figured out that you could remove the AA battery, connect wires to the battery terminals, and then connect those wires to as many C- and D-cell batteries as you could gang together in a series. So instead of the usual 1.5V, you could pump 4.5V, 6V, 7.5V, or even 9V into those tiny cars. And boy, did they go. We could barely keep up as we raced them against each other down the halls, running behind them holding our battery packs. But the thrills were short-lived — I think the school banned them and all that current burned the tiny Stomper motors out after awhile. Fun while it lasted though! (via waxy)

                  <p>For the past 13 years, former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich has taught a class called Wealth &amp; Poverty at UC Berkeley. He retired from teaching this year and has uploaded his lectures from the course to YouTube. 
Welcome to my final UC Berkeley course on Wealth and Poverty. Drawing on my 40+ years in politics, including my time as secretary of labor, I offer a deeper look at why inequalities of income and wealth have widened significantly since the late 1970s in the United States, and why this poses dangerous risks to our society.
This course also offers insights into the political and public-policy debates that have arisen in light of this inequality, as well as possible means of reversing it.


Here&#x27;s the first lecture, What&#x27;s Happened to Income &amp; Wealth:

Reich has also published an abbreviated syllabus for each of the classes; links can be found in his course introduction (here&#x27;s class #1).

                  <p>In our community, it&#x27;s so common for developer projects to be open-source. I&#x27;m breaking with this trend for my blog, but I have good reasons! In this article, I&#x27;ll share my reasoning, as well as a workaround in case you _really_ want to see the source. If you&#x27;re considering whether a project should be open-source or not, I hope you&#x27;ll find it valuable.</p>

Every Christopher Nolan movie, ranked by the AV Club. Oppenheimer is a surprise #1. My #1 would be Dunkirk or maybe Inception. But I&#x27;ve always preferred The Dark Knight Rises to The Dark Knight so grain of salt and all that.

                  <p>To help celebrate 50 years of hip-hop, Cypress Hill visited NPR&#x27;s studios to perform a Tiny Desk Concert.
While the term &quot;pioneer&quot; is used loosely in pop culture today, few terms describe Cypress Hill&#x27;s impact over the past three decades more adequately. They are the first Latino hip-hop group to achieve platinum and multi-platinum status. B Real, Sen and producer DJ Muggs crafted a sound in the &#x27;90s that stretched beyond regional boundaries. It was dark, psychedelic and at times directly addressed mental health before the topic was commonplace. Many dismissed the group as &quot;stoner rappers,&quot; yet the members were fervent advocates for the legalization of weed long before it came to fruition.


Really enjoyed this one...I&#x27;m not a particular fan of Cypress Hill but after this, maybe I am?

I saw Oppenheimer last night (great!) and the first thing I did when I got home was to order the book on which it&#x27;s based, the Pulitzer-winning American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer.

                  <p>It&#x27;s always fun to see what the former President is planning on reading over the summer. Here&#x27;s his full list:
Poverty, by America by Matthew Desmond.
Small Mercies by Dennis Lehane.
King: A Life by Jonathan Eig.
Hello Beautiful by Ann Napolitano.
All the Sinners Bleed by S.A. Cosby.
Birnam Wood by Eleanor Catton.
What Napoleon Could Not Do by DK Nnuro.
The Wager by David Grann.
Blue Hour by Tiffany Clarke Harrison.


I&#x27;ve read The Wager (so good!) and have been wanting to dig into Matthew Desmond&#x27;s book but most of the rest of these are new to me.
Right now, I&#x27;m reading Hugh Howey&#x27;s Wool (after inhaling the first season of Silo) and American Prometheus (after seeing Oppenheimer last night) — I&#x27;m sensing a pattern here...

                  <p>WordPress has been with me since my very first post in 2009.
There is a lot to love about it: It’s open source, it has a thriving ecosystem, a beautiful default theme, and a revolutionary block editor that makes my inner UX geek giddy.
Plus, WP made building a website and publishing content accessible to everyone.
No wonder it’s the most popular CMS in the world, by a huge margin.
However, for me, the bad had started to outweigh the good:
Things I could do in minutes in a static site, in WP required finding a plugin or tweaking PHP code.
It was slow and bloated.
Getting a draft out of it and into another medium was a pain.
Despite having never been hacked, I was terrified about it, given all the horror stories.
I was periodically getting “Error establishing a database connection” errors, w…</p>

                  <p>Long-time readers will recall that I used to link to Flash games pretty regularly. They were typically easy to play and hard to put down — I collected them under the addictive Flash games tag. The collective time and energy spent by kottke.org readers playing these games over the years is, well, I don&#x27;t even want to take a guess. So, it is with regret for the rest of your workday that I pass along this site that contains playable versions of tens of thousands of Flash games, including many of the ones I&#x27;ve collected. Here are several that you might remember:
Cyclomaniacs
Fantastic Contraption 2



Hedgehog Launch



Desktop Tower Defense



Solipskier



Gimme Friction Baby



BridgeCraft



Idleplex



Axon



Wonderputt



Love



Alphabet Shoot



Bubble Tanks Tower Defense



Perfect Balance



Don&#x27;t Shoot the Puppy

Good luck with all that...I only escaped after an hour of poking around. 😬 (via waxy)

                  <p>François Vautier installed an ant colony in his scanner and scanned it each week for five years. This is the resulting time lapse video.
Five years ago, I installed an ant colony inside my old scanner that allowed me to scan in high definition this ever evolving microcosm (animal, vegetable and mineral). The resulting clip is a close-up examination of how these tiny beings live in this unique ant farm. I observed how decay and corrosion slowly but surely invaded the internal organs of the scanner. Nature gradually takes hold of this completely synthetic environment.

                  <p>54 years ago today, on July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong &amp; Buzz Aldrin landed on the Moon and went for a little walk. For the 15th year in a row, you can watch the original CBS News coverage of Walter Cronkite reporting on the Moon landing and the first Moon walk on a small B&amp;W television, synced to the present-day time. Just open this page in your browser today, July 20th, and the coverage will start playing at the proper time. Here&#x27;s the schedule (all times EDT):
4:10:30 pm: Moon landing broadcast starts
4:20:15 pm - 10:51:26 pm: Break in coverage
10:51:27 pm: Moon walk broadcast starts
Set an alarm on your phone or calendar! Also, this works best on an actual computer but I think it functions ok on phones and tablets if necessary.
Back in 2018, I wrote a bit about what to look out for when you&#x27;re watching the landing:
The radio voices you hear are mostly Mission Control in Houston (specifically Apollo astronaut Charlie Duke, who acted as the spacecraft communicator for this mission) and Buzz Aldrin, whose job during the landing was to keep an eye on the LM&#x27;s altitude and speed — you can hear him calling it out, &quot;3 1/2 down, 220 feet, 13 forward.&quot; Armstrong doesn&#x27;t say a whole lot...he&#x27;s busy flying and furiously searching for a suitable landing site. But it&#x27;s Armstrong that says after they land, &quot;Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.&quot;. Note the change in call sign from &quot;Eagle&quot; to &quot;Tranquility Base&quot;. :)
Two things to listen for on the broadcast: the 1201/1202 program alarms I mentioned above and two quick callouts by Charlie Duke about the remaining fuel towards the end: &quot;60 seconds&quot; and &quot;30 seconds&quot;. Armstrong is taking all this information in through his earpiece — the 1202s, the altitude and speed from Aldrin, and the remaining fuel — and using it to figure out where to land.

                  <p>After my post about Soap Bubble Worlds yesterday, several people sent me this video of the rainbow colors that can be seen on the surface of and in the steam above a swirling cup of hot water. I was expecting a straight-forward visual display accompanied by some relaxing music (and that version does exist) but it also includes a fascinating explanation of where all these colors and swirls come from.
Scientific investigations into beautiful phenomena always makes me think of physicist Richard Feynman&#x27;s thoughts on beauty:
I have a friend who is an artist, and has sometimes taken a view which I don&#x27;t agree with very well. He&#x27;ll hold up a flower and say &quot;Look how beautiful it is&quot; and I&#x27;ll agree. And he says, &quot;you see, as an artist I can see how beautiful this is, but you as a scientist take this all apart and it becomes a dull thing.&quot; And I think that he&#x27;s kind of nutty.
First of all, the beauty that he sees is available to other people, and to me too, I believe - although I may not be quite as refined aesthetically as he is, but I can appreciate the beauty of a flower. At the same time, I see much more about the flower than he sees. I could imagine the cells in there, the complicated actions, which also have a beauty. I mean, it&#x27;s not just beauty at this dimension of one centimeter, there&#x27;s also beauty at smaller dimensions. The inner structure, also the processes, the fact that the colors and the flower are evolved in order to attract insects to pollinate it is interesting. It means that insects can see the color.
It adds a question: Is this aesthetic sense also exist in the lower forms that... why is it aesthetic... all kinds of interesting questions which the science, knowledge, only adds to the excitement, and mystery, and the awe of a flower. It only adds. I don&#x27;t understand how it subtracts.


(thx, everyone)

Migrating was a good opportunity to rethink the information architecture of my site,
especially around categorization.
Categories vs Tags
Just like most WP users, I was using both categories and tags, simply because they came for free.
However the difference between them was a bit fuzzy, as evidenced by how inconsistently they are used, both here and around the Web.
I was mainly using Categories for the type of article (Articles, Rants, Releases, Tips, Tutorials, News, Thoughts),
however there were also categories that were more like content tags (e.g. CSS WG, Original, Speaking, Benchmarks).
This was easily solved by moving the latter to actual tags.
However, tags are no panacea, there are several is…</p>

                  <p>This advertisement from Orange, the French telecom company, about the French national football team is one of the best commercials I&#x27;ve seen recently. I don&#x27;t want to tell you too much about it because the impact of it comes from watching it, so just watch it and you&#x27;ll see. And afterwards, you can read more about the ad here.

                  <p>Cutting to the chase: text editors *and* tabs vs. spaces!  Ooooh!


I&#x27;ve had this thing called &quot;e&quot; for a while now.  It&#x27;s a stupid little 
script which serves to do a couple of things.  It starts my 
editor
with a given file, and it kicks it with the right arguments to make it 
disable line wrapping and to make the [TAB] key actually put in two 
spaces.


So, my dumb script would use &quot;-w -E -T 2&quot; most of the time, except when it 
was running on a Makefile, at which point it would skip those args.  
Simple enough, right?


pico is back?  Yes indeed, on Macs, as of 12.3, pico is in fact back.  To 
make sure I wasn&#x27;t imagining things, I tracked down a machine that hadn&#x27;t 
been upgraded yet and checked there.  Sure enough, it was in fact nano and 
not pico.


macOS 12.3 has nano as a symlink... pointing to pico!


At some point, I switched from literal tab characters in my source code to 
blobs of spaces, probably due to using that style at work and not hating 
it.  So, somewhere along the line I actually started depending on nano 
behavior without realizing it.


As for the lack of a feature in pico itself, it&#x27;s kind of strange, really.  
If you go digging into the source, they have this random.c with a function 
called tab which claims to &quot;simulate tab stop&quot; using spaces.  That said, I 
can&#x27;t find any place where it would be called with the magic values which 
would make it behave that way.


It wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if this switch is just more of Apple removing 
GPLed things from their OS - pico seems to use the Apache license.  They 
dumped bash for zsh (MIT license) at some point (Big Sur, I think), and 
now this?  Okay then.</p>

                  <p>Here&#x27;s a very old and stupid trick you could do with some filesystems in 
some situations back in the day... and might still be able to do in a 
few places today.


The problem is that while version X might eventually have an exploit, 
it&#x27;ll get removed and it&#x27;ll be replaced by version Y without that
particular hole.  By the time you get your hands on a tool to break into 
X, it&#x27;ll be gone.


What you&#x27;d do is create a hard link pointing at the file you wanted to 
preserve, storing it in a spot which was writable by your account.  
Then, say, /usr/bin/sudo (because that never has security 
issues...) gets replaced at some point with a new file and you get to 
keep the old version.  When you get the tool to pop it, off you go!


Of course, these days, it&#x27;s not quite so easy on the more modern systems 
you find.  Debian 11 here won&#x27;t let me do it - it&#x27;s EPERM city.  Rocky 8 
(so CentOS 8 and RHEL 8 too) also won&#x27;t do it.  They both have some gunk
in /usr/lib/sysctl.d to lock this down.  But, my old Slackware 14.2 
install of my workstation let me do it the last time I tried about 
a year ago.  How about that, huh?  I bet it&#x27;d still work if I dug out 
the old drives and booted them up.


Incidentally, this is the magic sauce: /proc/sys/fs/protected_hardlinks
Read the man page for proc(5) to learn more about it.

here it is,
the thread I read a long time ago.  It&#x27;s interesting to note that as far 
as I can tell, nothing actually changed upstream.  This left paranoid 
admins like me with no option but to use the (most excellent) Openwall 
patches to lock down this kind of stuff.  I used that on my machines at 
work which had non-staff users... just in case.


This whole situation is scary.

                  <p>Back in January, you might have seen my
post
about a very large BBS which seemed to solve for the problem of &quot;how do 
we host a bunch of users&quot; by having one physical box per user.  It might 
have been one physical box per *two* users, maybe, but it&#x27;s hard to say.


Now, keep in mind digital cameras weren&#x27;t easy to come by, so I have 
very few actual pictures.  I&#x27;ll have to do a lot of explaining to make 
up for the lack of detail and alternate angles.  Clearly, I had no 
notion of ever using these pictures to tell stories 25+ years later.


Some friends at a local company had some bandwidth to spare (a T1 to 
Alternet somewhere, as I recall), so they parked a Zoom modem on one of 
their boxes and plugged it into a phone line.  We got an identical model 
to avoid cross-brand issues (Zoom m…</p>

brought about this whole notion of &quot;microkitchens&quot;.  This is where

                  <p>One of the fun things I used to do at a prior job was to dig through the 
raw data points which were collected from the *many* servers we had.  I 
could just pick an interesting-sounding metric and then would just ask 
the system to show me the top 10 or bottom 10 out of a population of 
thousands or more.


To get my feet wet with the whole &quot;investigations&quot; thing that we&#x27;d do, I 
started looking into this one day and chose one of the many temp sensors 
which were being logged by the servers.  I forget exactly which one it 
was, for there were many.  The CPUs logged it, the chassis logged it, 
the power supply logged it, and so on.  There were so many choices.


I went looking for a reason.  What could possibly explain this?  First 
off, it didn&#x27;t line up with any obvious pattern in the host names.  The 
hosts were named for whichever team owned them, followed by a sequence 
number that was bumped any time a new one was provisioned.  There was no 
signal to be found in that.


There was more, though.  You could also see a &quot;rack position&quot; in this 
data, and now it started getting interesting.  It seems that all of the 
really hot machines had a rack position of something low, like 04 or 05, 
and never anything higher than that.  In fact, when looking at a whole 
rack, it was always the lowest number of all of the positions that were 
being used.  Now this was worth chasing!


It&#x27;s good that I asked, since they told me something surprising: 
position 04 or 05 or whatever was the *bottom* of the rack.  Yes, 
somehow, the lowest machine in the rack was the hottest!  They found 
this interesting, too, and wound up digging into it.  Given that I was 
far away in a distant office, this was the best way for us to proceed.


The problem was that the bottommost server would have nothing below it 
but just open space until it got to the floor.  That space would not 
move air efficiently, and it obviously mattered.


This rolled out and my hot spots disappeared.  Fantastic!</p>

                  <p>Another day, another bit of local flavor, but this time it&#x27;s something I 
wish I didn&#x27;t have to write about.

wrote
about seeing a maintenance truck rolling down the Caltrain line in 
Mountain View.  It had a special attachment to let it stay on the rails.  
At no point did the arms come down for the crossing.  It managed to 
approach, then the people inside looked around and went through, and the 
arms never budged.  There were no flashing lights or bells.




caught fire.  A bunch of people were hurt.  More were shaken 
up.


I&#x27;m assuming their construction trucks don&#x27;t trigger the &quot;short the 
rails together to signal various things&quot; logic, either.  This would 
mean that crossing arms stay up... and I have to assume it also means 
the signals along the way stay green instead of going red.

We will presumably hear more about whatever the signals said, and 
whether the train went past a red signal or not.  I just have a bad 
feeling that they saw a green and kept on going.</p>

                  <p>Here&#x27;s a little bit of Silicon Valley local flavor for a change.  We 
have this freeway that runs from San Jose to San Francisco called US 
101, or around here, just &quot;101&quot;.  (Southern California has it too, but 
they call it &quot;the&quot; 101.  That&#x27;s how we detect invaders.)  Anyway, this 
thing is usually eight or more lanes up and down the peninsula, and it&#x27;s 
had a &quot;diamond&quot; or car pool lane on the #1 (innermost/&quot;fast&quot;) lane for 
many years.  You had to have a certain number of people in the car (or 
some other conditions met) during certain hours (AM and PM rush, 
weekdays), or you&#x27;d be in for a hefty ticket.


How does the system know what to charge you?  Well, you either have an 
old-style toll transponder that always bills you as a solo driver, or 
you have a new-style transponder with a 1/2/3+ switch that tells the 
road how to handle you.


Think about what this does to enforcement.  Now, instead of just &quot;is 
there a vehicle in the lane&quot;, &quot;is it the right time during a weekday&quot;, 
and &quot;how many people are in the car&quot;, now it&#x27;s also a matter of &quot;do they 
have their transponder set properly&quot;.

they wanted to provide a service to other things running on the same

that would go through release processes and all of that good stuff, they 
went for a different design entirely.

to poll it from time to time.  Actually doing that poll like a good

Given the reality of the situation, does it make sense to poll every 10 
seconds?  Probably not, right?  Someone set up something like that and 
left it running for a couple of months until I finally noticed it and 
dealt with it myself.


Given this, you can keep track of the &quot;Last-Modified&quot; header when you 
get a copy of the feed.  Then, you can turn around and use that same 
value in an &quot;If-Modified-Since&quot; header the next time you come to look 
for an update.  If nothing&#x27;s changed, the web server will notice it&#x27;s 
the same as what it already has, and it&#x27;ll send you a HTTP 304 co…</p>

                  <p>Here&#x27;s a concept: &quot;ssh to prod and edit directly on the machine&quot; is 
generally bad news.


I should point out that I didn&#x27;t know this person and had no idea how 
they would respond to such feedback - it might have been fine!  They 
might be a well-adjusted person who can take a request like that and not 
turn it around into a full-on nuclear attack.  But, I didn&#x27;t know either 
way.


At some point, I actually had a meeting with this developer for some 
other reason, and what happened was kind of amazing.  First thing, he 
brought it up and asked me about it.  I said something like, &quot;well, I 
didn&#x27;t want to get into it, but since you asked&quot;, and proceeded into 
something along the lines of &quot;obviously it would be best if you didn&#x27;t 
do that - sshing in and twiddling Python files on the actual production 
AWS instance of the service&quot;.


&quot;But... I suspect you are doing it for some reason?&quot;


My response was... I hope... reasonable: &quot;So as much as I would love to 
say &#x27;don&#x27;t do that!!!&#x27;, I&#x27;m not going to stand in the way of you 
literally doing your job.  So please proceed with care, and keep an eye 
open for some day when (first dumb thing) and (second dumb thing) aren&#x27;t 
problems any more and you need not do this any more.&quot;


It was either &quot;edit in prod&quot; or endure DAY LONG development cycles: make 
a change, wait 24 hours, come back tomorrow, and try it again.  That&#x27;s 
how broken it was.


The best part about this was that we had a totally reasonable 
conversation about it.  It&#x27;s the kind of thing which had become a rare 
commodity in those days at that place.


Would I expect someone else to go to that level of insanity every single 
time they just want to get their job done?  Absolutely not.

Editing files in prod to develop them?  That&#x27;s bad news.  Deliberately 
rigging tunnels to spoof a connection from prod?  That&#x27;s also bad news.  
Having to do them to get your job done?  You might be in the bad place.</p>

                  <p>Quite a while back, I wrote a post that basically went like this: if 
someone has a problem with someone else or something that person is 
doing, they&#x27;re going to find a way to get to &quot;no&quot;.  They will find some 
reason, some excuse, or some problem with it.  They&#x27;ll bring up a point 
and you&#x27;ll show that this is not in fact a thing.  They will then pivot 
again and again.


But, as I said, that was back then, and this time I&#x27;m talking about 
something else: when it happens in person with a coworker.  I had an 
experience like this a few years back, and figured I&#x27;d share how it goes 
for the sake of others who might not have encountered it yet, or who 
have and thought they were alone in this.

                  <p>This is a short one since it&#x27;s somewhere between a random bit of 
&quot;grab some popcorn&quot; amusement and a &quot;huh, that might be a problem some 
day&quot;.  In short, it looks like every Raspberry Pi filesystem installed 
from any given release image probably ends up with the same
UUID.


For instance, if you downloaded the &quot;lite&quot; version of Raspbian between 
roughly November 8th and January 28th, you probably got a file called 
2021-10-30-raspios-bullseye-armhf-lite.zip.  Inside, there&#x27;s an image, 
and the idea is that you dump that straight to your SD card, cram it in 
the Pi, and off you go.  The second partition on that image is an ext4 
filesystem which was created on some build machine somewhere.  The UUID 
on it never gets &quot;evolved&quot; to something else after the install.


You can see it inside the image itself here:


Or, if you actually installed a few of these things like I did over the 
past couple of months, you can just &#x27;tune2fs -l /dev/mmcblk0p2&#x27; and see 
the same value in there.


Don&#x27;t end up with a pile of SD cards on your desk and think &quot;I know, 
I&#x27;ll use the filesystem UUIDs to track which one goes where&quot;, in other 
words.


If it&#x27;s not breaking anything for you, it&#x27;s probably best to just let it 
be.  Untangling a boot mess on these weird little boxes is anything but 
fun.

Note: if you&#x27;re actually on a recent Raspberry Pi, odds are good that 
your /etc/fstab will be using *partition* UUIDs (PARTUUID&#x3D;...) and not 
those of the filesystem.  If in doubt, use blkid to see what&#x27;s what.</p>

                  <p>There are some interesting implications to the way that you have to 
handle references to other bits of code when you write a C++ header 
file.  There are things you can do which turn out to be suboptimal, and 
until or unless you work someplace with a coding style document or get 
some mentor who&#x27;s already been there, you&#x27;re likely to make some
mistakes.


Anyway, a common way to do this is to set up the outer class such that 
it has a pointer to the inner one.  You *could* have it just own it 
directly, but then that introduces problems.

  Bar bar_;



Of course, bar.h probably has its own dependencies which get #included, 
and so now you end up with this evil web of slow compiles.  It sucks.

                  <p>Yesterday, I
put forth
a bunch of API possibilities for the problem of needing to return a 
value but also indicating the lack of a value and being able to comment 
on why.  In it, the notion of a &quot;wrapper&quot; around a string was presented, 
such that it might look like &quot;Result&quot;, and those brackets 
started looking like a pain.  There was also the possibility of having 
something like &quot;ResultString&quot;, but didn&#x27;t that open the door to having a 
bunch of code duplication?


After this had existed for a while, the general happy feeling of having 
this stuff in place became infectious.  I wanted it to cover other 
things with it, too.  I wanted it to handle something a bit more 
complicated than a mere string, and so decided to try my hand at the

                  <p>If you agree with the notion that you need to be able to tell the 
difference between the absence of a value and a value itself, then this 
has some impacts on the code you write.  If you want to keep &#x27;em 
separated (so they can come out and play), then it gets you looking at 
your API designs in certain ways.


Imagine we&#x27;re talking about a helper function that is intended to be run 
inside a program that&#x27;s handling the access to a web page.  It&#x27;s 
probably a CGI program, but it could also be buried inside some much 
bigger thing, too.  This is all about C++ styles, but you can probably 
see slices of other languages in here, too.

I mentioned taking my old Mac Mini out of the OS X/macos ecosystem and

attempted to install a Javascript linter (and it tried to drag in 180+

have been going in the past few years.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s still biting 
people all over the place.  There are far too many posts asking people 
to upgrade their software, or restart things, or do any number of 
useless rubber-chicken-waving techniques which ultimately will 
accomplish nothing.

When you see a funny-looking number, figure out where it comes from.
That&#x27;s the only way to have any chance of understanding what&#x27;s actually 
going on.</p>

                  <p>Yep, it&#x27;s time for another round of reader feedback.

&quot;process infection&quot; story:

https://lwn.net/Articles/883547/):


If you do privileged execution of specific operations via IPC you get 
the guarantee that whatever is done, is done from a well-defined, 
pristine execution environment, without leaking context implicitly. The 
IPC message is the *full* vulnerable surface, and that&#x27;s as minimal as 
it can get. And that&#x27;s great.




Oh wow, thank you for mentioning that, unnamed reader!  I definitely 
read that post on LWN at some point in the past couple of days when the 
pkexec thing started going around.  It must have really worked its way 
into my head, and then eventually stirred up the memory of everything 
getting &quot;nicely infected&quot; at $OLD_JOB.

                  <p>I once worked at a place that had an interesting little problem stemming 
from the way they managed machines and some of the fun side-effects 
processes can have on each other.  This is back in the pre-systemd days 
of running services, such that things tended to be started or restarted 
by someone or something that itself ran as root.  That is, if you 
started something, it might inherit one or more things from your 
environment.  Likewise, if you ran something with an unusual 
environment, it might bestow those &quot;gifts&quot; onto anything it happened to 
touch.


After locking themselves out of machines too many times, people 
generally learned that after you mess with a glibc upgrade, you restart 
the sshd listener on port 22.  Of course, they also had to learn to not 
whack EVERY sshd at the…</p>

                  <p>Nearly 30 years ago, I was given this picture.  I wanted to present it 
in a post all by itself to give it a chance to &quot;sink in&quot; before I went 
and used it in an analogy.  First, I&#x27;ll just show the image and explain 
what you&#x27;re looking at here.




I do remember the description from the back: this is a picture of *part 
of* something that was called the Software Creations BBS.  It was a 
multi-line bulletin board system where you could dial up and send 
messages to people, upload and download files, and (presumably) play 
online games (&quot;doors&quot;) and anything else they cared to offer.

64 machines in a little space.  I have to assume 
they are at least 
286s (ATs, more or 
less), but it&#x27;s impossible to tell from just this picture.  They could 
have been 386s or even 486s by that point, but …</p>

                  <p>Okay, so yesterday I 
posted
a picture of an old multi-line bulletin board system which had 
apparently taken over an entire bedroom with dozens of computers.  I 
mentioned that I intended to come back to the topic to throw in my own 
two cents, and so here we go.


Or, were you someone who found it horrific and wished there was a 
simpler way?  Did you wonder if it would be possible to pack all of that 
into one or maybe two boxes, instead?  Did you want a way to negate all 
of that complexity while still providing the same level of service?


Now, things are different.  I look at that and just sigh at the lost 
opportunities.  The actual amount of work being done on behalf of any of 
the users who are connected is tiny.  If we ignore the fact that the 
actual BBS software and related acc…</p>
