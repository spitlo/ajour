But how do we create AI that serves society without disempowering some of us? How can we make sure these innovations are fair and trustworthy? Those are the questions we asked last May […]

                  <p>In this video from Architectural Digest, architect Michael Wyetzner runs us through why American diners look the way they do. Early diners took their cues from trains:
So let&#x27;s take a look at a typical American diner. So the outside has a shape that&#x27;s reminiscent of a train. In fact, that&#x27;s how diners got their name. They&#x27;re named after the dining car on a train.
Many of the design elements in a diner are based on the necessities of dining on a train in a railroad car, like booth seating and counter seating, and an open kitchen.
So I like these two photos because they show all the elements that go into the classic American diner. On the exterior, you have that stainless steel smooth curvature, you&#x27;ve got that Art Deco typography. And then on the interior you have the checkered floor, you have the booths, you have the globes, and you have the jukebox.
In the early part of the 20th century, trains were the dominant form of travel. If you look at some of the earliest diners, they were in fact, actual train cars that were placed permanently on the ground.


Later, cars and space travel provided inspiration in the diner&#x27;s evolution.

You can only be secure from some threat. A fire alarm won&#x27;t protect you from burglaries. A condom won&#x27;t protect you from mass shootings. It seems obvious, but how often do we hear about &quot;security&quot; without any mention of who is being made secure, and from which threat? Take the US welfare system. It is very …</p>

                  <p>The Friar&#x27;s Club was founded in 1904 and, like other private social clubs of the era, their membership was male-only. Women could visit as guests but only after 4pm and the club didn&#x27;t admit its first woman as a member until Liza Minnelli in 1987.
One of the club&#x27;s biggest traditions was its closed-door luncheon roasts of celebrities, which over the years included roasts of Humphrey Bogart, Johnny Carson, Milton Berle, Redd Foxx, and Bruce Willis.1 A few women were roasted before 1987 (Lucille Ball, Martha Raye, Barbra Streisand) but they were not allowed as guests. They even sent the waiters out of the room for the roasts.
In 1983, after months of planning, Phyllis Diller dressed up as a man (named Phillip Downey) and attended the roast of Sid Caesar (she&#x27;s on the left in the photo above with her co-conspirator, Howard Rosen). Here are a pair of videos of Diller talking about her infiltration. To be fair, the Friar&#x27;s Club didn&#x27;t seem that mad at her because they roasted her just two years later.

In 2004, the club roasted Donald Trump (roastmaster was Regis Philbin) and the next year Trump served as roastmaster for Don King. What a weird time/place/thing.↩

                  <p>This is great: The Cut asked 100 people to scream as loud as they could in front of a camera. For some, it was cathartic while others found it uncomfortable. Some folks didn&#x27;t know how to scream which I don&#x27;t entirely understand?
This video reminded me a lot of Ten Meter Tower, one of my all-time favorite short documentaries, in which dozens of people are filmed jumping from a 10-meter diving platform for the first time. Both videos deal with inner vs. outer selves and people&#x27;s comfort with expressing vulnerability. (via colossal)

                  <p>I&#x27;ve been branching out from my usual Game Boy folly and have been tinkering with the Wonder Swan (an interesting little Japanese exclusive handheld). The original Wonder Swan can do eight shades of grey and has no backlight (very much like the original Game Boys for viewing).
Given my experience with Game Boys and recent (basic) electronics, I thought I&#x27;d try my hand at a backlight mod (where LEDs are used light up behind the display). I&#x27;m pretty happy with the final result and this is how I did it.

For the backlight, I used a faulty DS Lite display - both bottom or top screen will work as we&#x27;re only interested in the LED and filters.

From the DS Lite display, remove the metal shielding from the back, remove the front polarizer (I&#x27;m guessing) and then separate the back (whit…</p>

                  <p>For the last few years, Amazon has spent a couple of summer days putting a bunch of their most popular items on sale for their Prime members. This year, Prime Day runs from July 11-12 and includes a number of things that I can personally recommend (or are currently coveting). Keep in mind that you need to be an Amazon Prime member to take advantage of these deals: here&#x27;s where you sign up for Prime if you&#x27;re interested (there&#x27;s a free 30-day trial).
Ok first, there are a bunch of deals on Apple products, including the 2nd-generation AirPods Pro (20% off) that I am a big fan of. (That&#x27;s actually not a Prime-only deal, but it&#x27;s $50 cheaper than Apple sells them for.) The AirPods Max are $100 off, the 2nd-gen AirPods are just $90 (30% off), and the 3rd-gen AirPods are $30 off.

This short video is an excerpt from a longer livestream Finnbogason did — here&#x27;s another short excerpt that shows just how large the eruption is and how close some people are getting to it:

He&#x27;s starting another livestream of the eruption in just a few minutes here (at 2:30pm ET) if you&#x27;d like to follow along.

                  <p>There&#x27;s a small moment in second-to-last episode of the season two of The Bear (extremely mild spoilers) that I liked even though you blink and you&#x27;ll miss it. One of the new chefs is tentatively salting some steaks and Sydney says &quot;I need you to salt that like a sidewalk&quot;. Cut to Carmy, who walks up muttering &quot;Where&#x27;d you grow up, Arizona?&quot;, takes the salt, and absolutely just drenches the steaks in salt. And I was like, yeah, that&#x27;s how you salt a steak!
Several years ago, I started noticing in various cooking videos how much salt chefs put in &amp; on food, particularly meat. I already knew that ample salting was important to the flavor, but I hadn&#x27;t realized that I wasn&#x27;t going far enough. I was being timid with my salting, afraid of oversalting and ruining dinner. Around this time, I read a Wired piece by chef David Chang about his Unified Theory of Deliciousness and I&#x27;ve been following his recommendation about salting food ever since:
My first breakthrough on this idea was with salt. It&#x27;s the most basic ingredient, but it can also be hellishly complex. A chef can go crazy figuring out how much salt to add to a dish. But I believe there is an objectively correct amount of salt, and it is rooted in a counterintuitive idea. Normally we think of a balanced dish as being neither too salty nor undersalted. I think that&#x27;s wrong. When a dish is perfectly seasoned, it will taste simultaneously like it has too much salt and too little salt. It is fully committed to being both at the same time.


This is the way. You&#x27;ll screw it up sometimes and go overboard, but if you can consistently get right up to that edge, your food will taste the best it possibly can. This works particularly well with steaks and burgers...my burger went from &quot;pretty good&quot; to &quot;holy shit&quot; solely on the application of the proper amount of salt.

                  <p>Hey folks. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve read about the heavy rains and the flooding in the Northeast, particularly in New York and Vermont. My town here in central VT did not flood last night (though some area fields may have) and appears to be out of danger but other places around me were not so lucky.
In particular, I&#x27;m stunned by the several feet of water that are currently covering Montpelier, the capital of Vermont and a place that I know pretty well. This is a video from late last night and early this morning of someone paddling around downtown Montpelier, surveying the flooding and interviewing locals:

The water is not rushing, just standing, and there is almost no one around — there&#x27;s an eerie quiet that&#x27;s punctuated by the sounds of alarms going off all around. And there&#x27;s just so much water.…</p>

                  <p>Craig Mod recently finished a 16-day tour of jazz kissas in northern Japan. Jazz kissas are bar/cafes where one goes to listen to jazz, mostly on records and not live. Mod loosely defies them thusly:
Mostly defined as: Mid-20th century &quot;listening cafes&quot; for jazz music. But there is a lot of variance in this definition. Lots are coffee-focused cafes, fitting into the broader &quot;kissaten&quot; universe. But some are more bar-like, and some even jazz clubs (but for the most part, live music is rare). You can tie yourself in knots splitting hairs over this stuff. Though they&#x27;re traditionally known as &quot;jazz kissa&quot; — the shortened version of &quot;kissaten&quot; (fear not: even if you call them &quot;jazz kissaten&quot; you won&#x27;t suddenly turn into a pillar of salt). Some are seventy years old. Some forty. Some are five years old. The important defining element is simply: A presiding and effusive ever-abiding love for jazz, jazz, and more jazz.


At each stop, he recorded the ambient sounds of each kissa so that you can experience a little bit of the atmosphere at these places — here&#x27;s the full playlist. The recordings were done with a pair of microphones so that the audio is in stereo. This sounds great with a good pair of headphones!

                  </ul>
                  <p>In a piece from January, Cory Doctorow outlined the enshittification lifecycle of online platforms:
Here is how platforms die: First, they are good to their users; then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers; finally, they abuse those business customers to claw back all the value for themselves. Then, they die.
...
This is enshittification: Surpluses are first directed to users; then, once they&#x27;re locked in, surpluses go to suppliers; then once they&#x27;re locked in, the surplus is handed to shareholders and the platform becomes a useless pile of shit. From mobile app stores to Steam, from Facebook to Twitter, this is the enshittification lifecycle.


Taking note of various platforms lighting themselves on fire recently, Mike Masnick offers a list of rules for the leadership of these platforms to follow to avoid turning into dumpster fires. Here&#x27;s rule #3:
Create more value than you capture. This one is not mine, but Tim O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s, and it&#x27;s one that constantly sticks with me. As you&#x27;re developing a business model, the best way to make sure that you&#x27;re serving your users best, and not enshittifying everything, is to constantly make sure that you&#x27;re only capturing some of the value you&#x27;re creating, and are instead putting much more out into the world, especially for your community. Your investors will push you to capture more and more of that value, but again, when you start chasing that, you&#x27;re also spiraling down the enshittification curve.


IMO, some of what is going on with Twitter &amp; Reddit is not enshittification per se, but more of a pushback against the power of their users. (I always think of Tron in instances like these. &quot;I fight for the users!&quot;) I think these CEOs know on some level that they&#x27;re making their product worse, but bringing their user bases to heel is worth the short-term headaches.

                  <p>Hello! Here’s a new entry in the “cool software julia likes” section.
A little while ago I started using a Mac, and one of my biggest
frustrations with it is that often I need to run Linux-specific software. For
example, the nginx playground I
posted about the other day only works on Linux because it uses Linux namespaces (via bubblewrap)
to sandbox nginx. And I’m working on another playground right now that uses bubblewrap too.
This post is very short, it’s just to say that Lima seems nice and much simpler
to get started with than Vagrant.
enter Lima!
I was complaining about this to a friend, and they mentioned
Lima, which stands for Linux on Mac. I’d heard
of colima (another way to run Linux
containers on Mac), but I hadn’t realized that Lima also just lets you run VMs.
It was surprising…</p>

                  <p>Hello! In 2021 I released a small playground for testing nginx configurations
called nginx playground. There’s a
blog post about it here.
This is an extremely short post to say that at the time I didn’t make it open source,
but I am making it open source now. It’s not a lot of code but maybe it’ll be
interesting to someone.
Here’s the github repo. The
frontend is in static/ and the backend is in api/. The README is mostly an
extended apology for the developer experience and note that the project is
unmaintained. But I did test that the build instructions work!
why didn’t I open source this before?
I’m not very good at open source. Some of the problems I have with open sourcing things are:
I dislike (and am very bad at) maintaining open source projects – I usually
ignore basically all feature requests and most bug reports and then feel bad about it.
I handed off maintainership to both of the open source projects that I
started (rbspy and rust-bcc) to other people who are doing a MUCH better job than I ever did.
Sometimes the developer experience for the project is pretty bad
Sometimes there’s configuration in the project (like the fly.toml or the
analytics I have set up) which don’t really make sense for other people to
copy
new approach: don’t pretend I’m going to improve it
In the past I’ve had some kind of belief that I’m going to improve the problems
with my code later. But I haven’t touched this project in more than a year and
I think it’s unlikely I’m going to go back to it unless it breaks in some dramatic way.
So instead of pretending I’m going to improve things, I decided to just:
tell people in the README that the project is unmaintained
write down all the security caveats I know about
test the build instructions I wrote to make sure that they work (on a fresh machine, even!)
explain (but do not fix!!) some of the messy parts of the project
that’s all!
Maybe I will open source more of my tiny projects in the future, we’ll see!
Thanks to Sumana Harihareswara for helping me
think through this.</p>

                  <p>I just finished reading Octavia Butler&#x27;s Parable of the Sower (so good!) and while doing a little customary post-read research on it, I discovered that Butler wrote a sequel in 1998 called Parable of the Talents and, uh... (from Wikipedia):
The novel is set against the backdrop of a dystopian United States that has come under the grip of a Christian fundamentalist denomination called &quot;Christian America&quot; led by President Andrew Steele Jarret. Seeking to restore American power and prestige, and using the slogan &quot;Make America Great Again&quot;, Jarret embarks on a crusade to cleanse America of non-Christian faiths. Slavery has resurfaced with advanced &quot;shock collars&quot; being used to control slaves. Virtual reality headsets known as &quot;Dreamasks&quot; are also popular since they enable wearers to escape their harsh reality.


Well, our present reality certainly checks a remarkable number of those boxes, including an absolute bullseye on &quot;Make America Great Again&quot;.

                  <p>Not going to bury the lede here: this is a straight-up masterpiece and maybe the best thing I&#x27;ve seen all week. Hidari is a stop-motion animation of an inventive fight sequence between a lone warrior/craftsman and a boss &amp; his minions. The vibe of the animation is at once halting and buttery smooth, a combination that&#x27;s wonderfully expressive. Directed by Masashi Kawamura, the plan is to turn this into a feature-length film:
This is a pilot version of the stop-motion samurai film that tells the story of &quot;Jingoro Hidari,&quot; a legendary Edo-era craftsman. All the characters are made by wood and animated frame by frame, just like how Jingoro&#x27;s wooden sculptures came to life in his many anecdotes. We hope you enjoy this film, which mixes dynamic actions as seen in Japanimation, and the rich analog expressions of stop-motion animation.
Our intention is to use this pilot film as a starting point to create a full length feature film. We have started activities to raise the necessary partners and funding to achieve this goal.


Take my money! (P.S. Turn on subtitles if you don&#x27;t speak Japanese. Oh, and here&#x27;s a behind-the-scenes look at how they did the animation.)

                  <p>&quot;it&#x27;s what everyone wants in the year 2023: 8000 words on david foster wallace&quot; ⬅️ That&#x27;s how Patricia Lockwood shared her piece about the complicated legacy of David Foster Wallace on Bluesky. Turns out, it is what we want; this piece is brilliant. But it&#x27;s also unexplainable, so I&#x27;ll just post these three snippets and let you work out whether you want to read the rest of it or not.
As I read, I thought Wallace must have been taken by something very simple, the smallest sensual fact: that as an IRS worker you are issued a new social security number, in essence a new identity, a chance to start over. The old number, the old life, &#x27;simply disappeared, from an identification standpoint&#x27;. A whole novel could take flesh from that fact, one about the idea of bureaucratic identity as opposed to …</p>

                  <p>Yesterday I posted about the 2023 Drone Photo Awards and one of my favorite shots was of a playground/park in Poland. My curious pal Neven tracked down more information about the park and, well, it&#x27;s so cool and cute!



Here&#x27;s part of the description from the park&#x27;s creators, SLAS Architects:
&quot;Activity zone&quot; is a multifunctional public space which is the first phase of regeneration and integration of the University of Silesia campus with the urban tissue of Chorzów City.
The site is located in the place of the demolished military building with a number of old existing trees. &quot;Activity zone&quot; is designed as concrete platform strongly perforated and filled with a diverse programme that includes: students leisure zone, children&#x27;s play devices, fitness, individually designed elements of street furniture and greenery including all existing trees. Some parts of the garden are possible to develop by local seniors. The platform connects the diverse program, intensifies the use of the place and becomes itself an element of play. Variety of attractions enhance interactions between users of all age groups and integrates academic community with local inhabitants and the surrounding nature.


My only complaint: it&#x27;s maybe a little too small? But otherwise: top marks.

                  <p>Oh boy. I thought the teaser trailer was good, but the full trailer for Martin Scorsese&#x27;s Killers of the Flower Moon just dropped and I am. So. Excited. To. SEE. THIS!
At the turn of the 20th century, oil brought a fortune to the Osage Nation, who became some of the richest people in the world overnight. The wealth of these Native Americans immediately attracted white interlopers, who manipulated, extorted, and stole as much Osage money as they could before resorting to murder.


Once again, it&#x27;s based on David Grann&#x27;s Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI, which I highly recommend. Grann + Scorsese appears to be a potent combination — the latter is already signed on to adapt Grann&#x27;s latest bestseller, The Wager.

                  <p>I am a sucker for aerial photography, so I had a lot of fun looking through all the winners and runners-up of the 2023 Drone Photo Awards. As usual, I picked out a few favorites and included them above. From top to bottom, photos by: Sebastian Piórek (a very tidy Polish playground), Gheorghe Popa (amazing abstract shot), Matias Delacroix (a border crossing between Haiti and the Dominican Republic), and Brad Weiner (surfer).

                  <p>Illustrator Kevan Atteberry created the Clippy character that was introduced in Microsoft Office 97. There was a ton of backlash when the character was introduced, but as time has passed, many people have begun to think fondly of him. 
He&#x27;s a guy that just wants to help, and he&#x27;s a little bit too helpful sometimes. And there&#x27;s something fun and vulnerable about that.

                  <p>Astrophotographer Cari Letelier caught this amazing shot of the aurora borealis over the Goðafoss waterfall in Iceland. We live in a truly magical world — if science fiction authors made something like this up, you wouldn&#x27;t believe it&#x27;d ever be real. You can check out more of Letelier&#x27;s astrophotography on Instagram or on her website.
I found this via the Astronomy Picture of the Day site, a gem of the old school web that&#x27;s been sharing astronomy photos since 1995.

                  <p>In my last few posts and talks I covered my worries about the current job market in technology. Lots of people have been laid off in the last months and it is tough to find a role without making a lot of concessions. Every big tech company is slashing budgets and trying to save money […]</p>

                  <p>Precise. Symmetric. Stylized. Controlled (often bright) color palette. Slow-motion. Lateral tracking. These are all hallmarks of Wes Anderson&#x27;s films. But as this short video from Luís Azevedo shows, there are plenty of imperfect moments in his movies as well. Anderson is a canny filmmaker and it&#x27;s the contrast between the controlled worlds he constructs and these more frenetic, off-kilter, imperfect moments that gives them their weight and impact.

                  <p>Photographs have always been an imperfect reproduction of real life — see the story of Dorothea Lange&#x27;s Migrant Mother or Ansel Adams&#x27; extensive dark room work — but the seemingly boundless alterations offered by current &amp; future AI editing tools will allow almost anyone to turn their photos (or should I say &quot;photos&quot;) into whatever they wish. In this video, Evan Puschak briefly explores what AI-altered photos might do to our memories.
I was surprised he didn&#x27;t mention the theory that when a past experience is remembered, that memory is altered in the human brain — that is, &quot;very act of remembering can change our memories&quot;. I think I first heard about this on Radiolab more than 16 years ago. So maybe looking at photos extensively altered by AI could extensively alter those same memories in …</p>

                  <p>Greek photographer Anthimos Ntagkas stalks the streets in search of visual coincidences to capture and put on his Instagram account. My Modern Met talked to Ntagkas about his process:
Nowadays, I don&#x27;t choose the place, but I make every location work for me. I combine people with elements everywhere I stand. Luckily the themes in this type of photography are endless, and I never lose interest.

                  <p>After my wrangle with getting a timezone from an IP address by reducing large databases down from several hundred megabytes down to only a few, then discovering IPv6 didn&#x27;t work (so I then applied my same logic to get 700MB to 10MB), the ever lovely Phil Hawksworth pointed out that (of course) Netlify has this data available in their edge functions.
I totally overlooked the feature (maybe I didn&#x27;t even look!). So let&#x27;s implement that and then discover the glaring bug in all of the code so far.

Netlify edge function&#x27;s geo prop
Phil kindly sent me a direct message on Space Karen&#x27;s website pointing me to the geo property provided in edge function calls.
This (of course 🤦‍♂️) means the code for the function is (for me) stupid simple:
export default async (request, context) &#x3D;&gt; {

                  <p>Hey everyone! This is the list of all the changes we&#x27;ve done to our projects and apps during the month of June. We&#x27;ll also be reporting in our on position in the world, and on our future plans.
Summary Of Changes
100r.co, added propeller maintenance, Maple Bay, Telegraph Cove, Smuggler Cove and Princess Louisa Inlet.
Wiktopher, added back the revised/corrected version of Chapter 10, back online, and Chapter 11 has been corrected but is not yet live.
UxnFor, created an uxntal code formatter.
Bicycle, added lots of little improvements.
Adelie, added speaker&#x27;s notes and a pen mode.
News
Pino spent the first few days of the month on land, having its bottom re-painted, and its various bits serviced and checked. We took our propeller apart for the first time.
We&#x27;ve added a few write-ups of our travels so far (see above entry with links under 100r.co), but the most significant one is our 46nmi sail up to Princess Louisa Inlet, a long fjord on British Columbia&#x27;s Sunshine Coast, with an incredible gem at the end. It is an amazing, and unique place. We&#x27;re glad we finally got to go. As we write this, we are in Roscoe Bay on West Redonda Island, tethering off a phone hoisted up the mast (it works quite well).
This summer we are power stable. We had issues last year because of parisitic draws due to old wiring (see DC electrical refit), but now everything is working as it should. We&#x27;re charging our computers without an inverter, and that too is working out quite well so far (see charging electronics).
Together, Hikari and Lynn made chibicc-uxn, a c compiler for Uxn, and with it also released a port of the classic software Neko(xneko, oneko sakura).
Pino book &amp; movie club
We are reading Arkady and Boris Strugatsky&#x27;s Roadside Picnic. We&#x27;ve been re-watching Kaamelott for the hundredth time.

                  <p>So, ever since I&#x27;d heard that Bill Murray had to drop out of filming Asteroid City, I&#x27;ve wondered which role he&#x27;d meant to play. After seeing the movie, I thought it was either the grandfather (played by Tom Hanks) or the hotel manager (Steve Carell) and it was Carell&#x27;s role:
Murray was originally cast as a motel manager in the desert town where the movie is set, in 1955. &quot;Normally, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s such a nice idea to tell everyone the person who didn&#x27;t end up in the movie,&quot; Anderson said recently. &quot;But Bill got covid in Ireland, and it was four days before he was supposed to work.&quot; Murray was in Ireland for a family trip (&quot;And usually golf has something to do with it,&quot; Anderson said), en route to Spain, where &quot;Asteroid City&quot; was shooting. With Murray in quarantine, Anderson scrambled t…</p>

                  <p>CSS gives us so many options when it comes to expressing color—we can use hex codes, rgb, hsl, and more. Which option should we choose? This turns out to be a surprisingly important decision! In this article, we&#x27;ll take a tour of color formats in CSS, and see which option will serve us best.</p>

                  <p>Elie Mystal writing for the Nation on the Supreme Court&#x27;s recent decision that declared affirmative action in college admissions unconstitutional.
But the death of affirmative action was not achieved merely through the machinations of Republican lawyers. While conservatives on the Supreme Court delivered the fatal blow, the policy has long been made vulnerable by the soft bigotry of parents, whose commitment to integration and equality turns cold the moment their little cherubs fail to get into their first choice of college or university. If you want to see a white liberal drop the pretense that they care about systemic racism and injustice, just tell them that their privately tutored kid didn&#x27;t get into whatever &quot;elite&quot; school they were hoping for. If you want to make an immigrant family adopt a Klansman&#x27;s view of the intelligence, culture, and work ethic of Black folks, tell them that their kid&#x27;s standardized test scores are not enough to guarantee entry into ivy-draped halls of power. Some of the most horribly racist claptrap folks have felt comfortable saying to my face has been said in the context of people telling me why they don&#x27;t like affirmative action, or why my credentials are somehow &quot;unearned&quot; because they were &quot;given&quot; to me by affirmative action.
That last bit is in some ways the most devastating: Black people are attacked and shamed simply because the policy exists, regardless of whether it benefited them or not. I&#x27;ve had white folks whom I could standardize-test into a goddamn coma tell me that I got into school only because of affirmative action. I once talked to a white guy — whose parents&#x27; name was on one of the buildings on campus — who asked me how it felt to know I got &quot;extra help&quot; to get in. The sheer nerve of white folks is sometimes jaw-dropping.


I recommended this yesterday in a Quick Link, but Scene On Radio&#x27;s episode of their Seeing White series on White Affirmative Action is great.

                  <p>From TasteAtlas, a listing of the 150 Most Legendary Restaurants in the World &amp; Their Iconic Dishes. These aren&#x27;t necessarily the best restaurants on Earth, but places that have &quot;withstood the test of time, eschewing trendy gimmicks in favor of traditional, high-quality cuisine&quot;.
Here are a few of the entries from the list that I&#x27;ve either been to or would like to go to someday (ok, almost the whole list would have qualified for that):
2. Katz&#x27;s Delicatessen (pastrami on rye)
Schwartz&#x27;s is iconic, but I think Snowdon Deli has better smoked meat. In the same vein, I&#x27;ve had good steak and not-so-good steak at Luger&#x27;s — as far as an iconic NYC steakhouse goes, I would have gone for Keen&#x27;s.
I&#x27;m sure any food fan worth their (don&#x27;t say it, don&#x27;t say it) salt (ugh) could come up with a few dozen restaurants that could/should be on this list, but 150 is certainly a good start! Soba, bratwurst, ćevapi, udon, churrasco, kofte, phở, ramen, ceviche, sushi, risotto, bouillabaisse, dim sum, BBQ, Peking duck, biryani, xiao long bao...man, I&#x27;m so hungry now!

                  </ul>
                  <p>From Rabbi Danya Ruttenberg, a piece on the still-radical teachings of Fred Rogers, who emphasized the &quot;love thy neighbor&quot; part of the Bible rather than the twisted &quot;persecute the other&quot; version that has taken hold in so-called Christian communities in America over the past few decades.
Fred Rogers was a Presbyterian minister whose life&#x27;s work was, I believe, built almost entirely (if not entirely) around Leviticus 19:18: &quot;Love your neighbor as yourself: I am God.&quot; Hence... the neighborhood. In practice it that looked like this (all of these are his words): &quot;To love someone is to strive to accept that person exactly the way [they are], right here and now.&quot; and &quot;Everyone longs to be loved. And the greatest thing we can do is to let people know that they are loved and capable of loving.&quot;


Part of his philosophy was acknowledging that, because we loved them, we needed to have truthful, difficult conversations with our children. 
When Bobby Kennedy was murdered that same year, he did something that&#x27;s pretty much impossible to our world today.
He had a puppet tiger ask an actor:
&quot;What does &#x27;assassination&#x27; mean?&quot;
He knew that small children would be hearing this word, and that they would be aware that something major had happened. And that most of the time, when adults are preoccupied with communal tragedy and trauma, children get left out-to their own detriment.
Better they should know, in an age-appropriate way, and be given the tools to cope, than to be left out in the cold, as he put it, &quot;at the mercy of their own imaginations.&quot;
Again, naming true things and simply holding space to let children deal with them — rather than trying to hide or minimize or gaslight because it seems too hard.
That&#x27;s love.

                  <p>The Verge has published a list of the 40 best nonfiction books about &quot;tech&quot; (which relates to the industry centered around Silicon Valley &amp; the internet and not technology in general). I was pleased to see Broad Band: The Untold Story of the Women Who Made the Internet by Claire Evans and Small Fry by Lisa Brennan-Jobs on there, as well as Close to the Machine: Technophilia and Its Discontents by Ellen Ullman and Neil Postman&#x27;s Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology. I&#x27;m baffled that Tracy Kidder&#x27;s amazing The Soul of a New Machine didn&#x27;t make the top 5 or even 10.
But reading through the rest of the list, it occurred to me that I don&#x27;t really read tech books — and if I did, I didn&#x27;t get a whole lot from them. When I was younger and trying to understand the industry and momentous period I was participating in, I generally looked to books outside of tech as guides. I read things like How Buildings Learn by Steward Brand, The Death and Life of Great American Cities by Jane Jacobs, Chaos by James Gleick, The Timeless Way of Building by Christopher Alexander, and Understanding Comics by Scott McCloud.
Anyway, back to the list — it seems incomplete in a way that I can&#x27;t quite articulate. I would have liked to have seen Tom Standage&#x27;s The Victorian Internet on there. What else? I would like to hear about your favorite books about tech (or non-tech books that are sneakily about tech anyway) or what you think might be missing from the list. Leave your thoughts in the comments!

                  <p>This week I decided it was time to try to revive some of the casualties from my recent Vercel incident, and though webmentions.app is the more useful, I though I&#x27;d start with the, so I thought, low hanging fruit - &quot;how many days to Christmas&quot;.
It turned into 3 days of complicated problem solving and working against systems that just didn&#x27;t want to work the way I needed.

The context
I have a little app that runs on a internet connected clock that shows the days to Christmas. A little while ago, during December and Jan, the traffic (along with traffic on webmentions.app) spiked hard enough to cause Vercel to block my entire account.
So for the short term, I disabled the countdown app. Christmas, at the time, was a full year away, so I figured it wouldn&#x27;t be missed.

                  <p>The Chickening is a surreal visual remix of Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s The Shining done by Nick DenBoer and Davy Force. It mostly defies description, so just watch the first minute or so (after which you won&#x27;t be able to resist the rest of it). The short film is playing at this year&#x27;s Sundance Film Festival.
But seriously, WTF was that?! (via @UnlikelyWorlds)

                  <p>The other day I posted about how contemporary filmmakers, Wes Anderson in particular, use miniatures in their films. The model/prop maker featured, Simon Weisse, has worked with Anderson on several films, including his latest, Asteroid City. Weisse has been posting behind-the-scenes shots of his studio&#x27;s work on Asteroid City to his under-followed Instagram account and I thought a separate post highlighting some of those props and miniatures would be fun.





This video shows a bunch more of the miniatures used in the movie:

I also ran across a few behind-the-scenes videos of the production if you&#x27;re in the mood to deep-dive (as I appear to be):




If you&#x27;re lucky enough to be in London in the next week and a half, you can go and see some of these props and sets and even eat at the diner at 180 Studios. Very. Jealous.

                  <p>From the Library of Congress, footage of the first gay pride march in NYC in 1970. The march, called the Christopher Street Liberation Day Parade, was held on June 28 to commemorate the first anniversary of the Stonewall Uprising. From Gothamist:
The Christopher Street Gay Liberation Day March started in Greenwich Village at about 2 p.m. that day in 1970, just outside the Stonewall Inn, which was then for rent, having closed the previous October.
As they gathered, the marchers were few, and brave. There were groups from Washington, DC and Boston, college organizations from Rutgers, Yale and Columbia. Some transgender people who were there at the time said that organizers asked them to march in the back, but they refused.
&quot;The trans community said, &#x27;Hell no, we won&#x27;t go.&#x27; We fought for this as much as you did, or even started it,&quot; said Victoria Cruz. &quot;And we just mingled throughout the crowd. There was no trans contingent. We just mingled.&quot;
They started walking very briskly up Christopher Street, because they were scared. There had been bomb threats. People worried they would be shot at, or harassed again by the police. Martin Boyce was there, and he says that afterwards they joked it was &quot;the first run.&quot;
&quot;I was worried about being single file, because I just watched a program on National Geographic about wildebeests and I saw how the ones on the side were picked off. So I thought I would stay in the middle — but there was no middle.&quot;


As the march went on, it gathered people &amp; momentum and they eventually made it without major incident to Central Park.

                  <p>When you write some code and put it on a spacecraft headed into the far reaches of space, you need to it work, no matter what. Mistakes can mean loss of mission or even loss of life. In 2006, Gerard Holzmann of the NASA/JPL Laboratory for Reliable Software wrote a paper called The Power of 10: Rules for Developing Safety-Critical Code. The rules focus on testability, readability, and predictability:
Avoid complex flow constructs, such as goto and recursion.
All loops must have fixed bounds. This prevents runaway code.
Avoid heap memory allocation.
Restrict functions to a single printed page.
Use a minimum of two runtime assertions per function.
Restrict the scope of data to the smallest possible.
Check the return value of all non-void functions, or cast to void to indicate the return value…</p>

Curiously, though, we do seem to be able to edit objects and arrays that are created using “const”.

The thing is, we should lean heavily into subsidies for electric bikes — now.
If Denver&#x27;s experience is any guide, it&#x27;d be a huge boon for town, cities, and even many suburbs. Ebikes can&#x27;t be used to replace all car travel, of course; but as folks who experiment with them discover, wow, you start leaving your car at home a lot. If towns and cities are smart about how they organize and issue these credits, they can also help lower-in…</p>

                  <p>Yuri Suzuki&#x27;s The Ambient Machine is a device for creating atmosphere, playing ambient sounds. The machine has 32 toggle switches on it; each switch actives a different sound (waves, running water, birds, wind, white noise) that you can blend to create your perfect aural backdrop.
The Ambient Machine provides us with a variety of sounds and music that we can use to design our own background ambience. White noise can mask unpleasant sounds around us and give us a sense of relief, Natural sounds can provide the feeling of relocating to a new environment, providing a break from the environments we have been confined to, and musical rhythms can provide patterns for us to find stability with.


Only 20 models of the original machine were created and sold, but you can preorder a slightly different version for ¥143,000 (~$1,000).

                  <p>In 1990, the US government sent $20,000 and a formal letter of apology to more than 82,000 Japanese Americans who were incarcerated in concentration camps during World War II. Morgan Ome, whose grandfather was imprisoned and got a check, looks at the effect this had on those who received it and how the reparative process might look for other communities (Black and Native Americans).
In one of the letters, the daughter of an incarceree tells how the $20,000, invested in her family&#x27;s home equity and compounded over time, ultimately enabled her to attend Yale. &quot;The redress money my family received has always been a tailwind at my back, making each step of the way a tiny bit easier,&quot; she wrote. Just as her family was able to build generational equity, she hoped that Black Americans, too, would…</p>

                  <p>Vox talks to prop &amp; model maker Simon Weisse, who made miniatures for Wes Anderson&#x27;s Asteroid City, about the perhaps surprising popularity of miniatures in contemporary filmmaking, when the technique works and when it doesn&#x27;t (e.g. when unscalable elements like rain or fire/explosions are involved), and why certain directors use it instead of CGI.
Miniatures in movies are way more common than you may realize, and one of the most stylish filmmakers keeping them alive is Wes Anderson. In this video we spoke to Simon Weisse, prop maker and model marker for some of Wes Anderson&#x27;s recent projects, like The Grand Budapest Hotel, The French Dispatch, and Asteroid City.
Older movies, like 1977&#x27;s Star Wars: Episode IV — A New Hope, had no choice but to use miniatures to make their worlds feel real. But even in the modern day of CGI, filmmakers are still using minis — just look at projects like The Mandalorian, Blade Runner 2049, Harry Potter, and The Dark Knight series. In those movies, miniatures are used for expansive sets that establish the world of a film, otherworldly vehicles like spaceships, and more.


It&#x27;s perfect for Anderson&#x27;s storybook aesthetic, of course...it looks great in Asteroid City (which I really enjoyed overall).

P.S. The book covers tag is pretty good if you want to get distracted/inspired by fantastic design for 30 minutes.

an 13-pack of all my zines here.
Here’s the cover:

Here’s the table of contents!

  
Now let’s talk about some of the motivations for writing this zine!
motivation 1: demystify binary
I wrote this zine because I used to find binary data really impenetrable. There
are all these 0s and 1s! What does it mean?
But if you look at any binary file format, most of it is integers! For example,
if you look at the DNS parsing in Implement DNS in a Weekend, it’s all about encoding and
decoding a bunch of integers (plus some ASCII strings, which arguably are also arrays of integers).
So I think that learning how integers w…</p>

                  <p>Or rather, protozoan? Toxoplasma gondii is a protozoan parasite which is transmitted from rodents to cats through a crafty mechanism...it makes mice attracted to the smell of cat urine. Mouse goes near cat, cat eats mouse, T. gondii has a new host. From cats, the parasite can jump into humans, where it may be responsible for all sorts of nastiness:
Well, the behavioral influence plays out in a number of strange ways. Toxoplasma infection in humans has been associated with everything from slowed reaction times to a fondness toward cat urine — to more extreme behaviors such as depression and even schizophrenia. And here&#x27;s the kicker: Two different research groups have independently shown that Toxo-infected individuals are three to four times as likely of being killed in car accidents due to reckless driving.

	
And maybe makes us want to invent networking technology and share cool links? In this five-minute talk, Kevin Slavin cleverly connects viral media with T. gondii:

That video was so good, I watched the whole thing twice.

                  <p>The creepy twins. Jack feverish at the typewriter. Danny riding his Big Wheel through carpeted hallways. The elevators of blood. These familiar scenes from Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s horror classic The Shining (and several more) have been recreated in this Lego stop-motion animation. The video took 50-60 hours over a three-week period to make and was an exercise in constraints:
&quot;Mostly, it came down to choosing the right pieces,&quot; he says. &quot;I made this movie only with pieces I already had in my collection, so I had to do with just what I had laying around. For instance, the famous carpet pattern in the hallway could have been more realistic, but with the pieces I had, it became a little more abstract. I went with clay for the bloody elevator scene also because I do not have thousands of red translucent pieces.&quot;

                  <p>I loved Liu Cixin&#x27;s The Three-Body Problem trilogy (read it twice!) and was excited/apprehensive when Netflix announced they&#x27;d partnered with Game of Thrones showrunners D.B. Weiss and David Benioff to adapt the books into a TV series. Well, the first trailer is here and has tipped my scales more towards excited. Really looking forward to when this premieres in January 2024 — if they get it right, this could be something really special.

                  <p>Humility, a designer’s essential value—that has a nice ring to it. What about humility, an office manager’s essential value? Or a dentist’s? Or a librarian’s? They all sound great. When humility is our guiding light, the path is always open for fulfillment, evolution, connection, and engagement. In this chapter, we’re going to talk about why.
That said, this is a book for designers, and to that end, I’d like to start with a story—well, a journey, really. It’s a personal one, and I’m going to make myself a bit vulnerable along the way. I call it:
The Tale of Justin’s Preposterous Pate
When I was coming out of art school, a long-haired, goateed neophyte, print was a known quantity to me; design on the web, however, was rife with complexities to navigate and discover, a problem to be solved. …</p>

                  <p>Using the metaphor of a cancerous tumor as an unruly village, Kurzgesagt explains how cancer develops in the human body, how the body fights against it, and how, sometimes, the cancer develops into something unmanageable.
In a sense this tiny tumor is like a rogue town. Imagine a group of rebels in Brooklyn decided that they were no longer part of New York but started a new settlement called Tumor Town, which happens to  occupy the same space. The new city wants to grow, so it orders tons of steel beams, cement and drywall. New buildings follow no logic, are badly planned, ugly and dangerously crooked. They are built right in the middle of streets, on top of playgrounds and on existing  infrastructure. The old neighborhood is torn down or overbuilt to make room for new stuff. Many of the former residents are trapped in the  middle of it and begin to starve. This goes on for a while until the smell of death finally attracts attention. Building inspectors and police show up.

                  <p>On his YouTube channel this week, Phil Edwards explores the question of why all pop music radio stations in the US sound the same. The short answer is consolidation caused by deregulation but the longer answer is worth watching. And if you want more information, Edwards&#x27; list of sources in the video description is pretty extensive.

                  <p>Kurt Vonnegut is just the bee&#x27;s knees, isn&#x27;t he? Here&#x27;s a letter he wrote in 1973 to the head of the school board at Drake High School in North Dakota after the school burned all of its copies of Slaughterhouse-Five in the school&#x27;s furnace.
If you were to bother to read my books, to behave as educated persons would, you would learn that they are not sexy, and do not argue in favor of wildness of any kind. They beg that people be kinder and more responsible than they often are. It is true that some of the characters speak coarsely. That is because people speak coarsely in real life. Especially soldiers and hardworking men speak coarsely, and even our most sheltered children know that. And we all know, too, that those words really don&#x27;t damage children much. They didn&#x27;t damage us when we were young. It was evil deeds and lying that hurt us.

                  <p>Heidi Gustafson is the curator of Ochre Sanctuary, a collection of iron-based earths that are the oldest natural pigments used by humans. In her new Book of Earth, Gustafson details where these pigments come from and how to use them to create art. Here are a few images from the book and the Ochre Sanctuary:



Looks like a gorgeous book. Check out her Instagram for more colorful photos of ochres.

                  <p>The immense scale of the factory and the intense temperatures involved (along with a musical soundtrack that sounds like Interstellar by way of Philip Glass) makes this video about how rebar is made compelling viewing. There are several scenes from this video that would not be out of place in this collection of Real-Life Infrastructure That Looks Like Sci-Fi. And there&#x27;s a color gradient moment near the end that&#x27;s really lovely. (thx, alex)

                  <p>This conversation with musician Perfume Genius about his creative process is interesting throughout. This is something I relate to 1000%:
I&#x27;m good at making things, but not talking about why. I made them because I don&#x27;t know how to talk about why. The explanation is the thing I made.


This too is something I try to hold myself to:
I also just do it, you know what I mean? I just make shit. 90% of doing anything is doing it. Not to sound self-help-y, but when people are asking me for advice, my first thought is, you should just do it. You beat so many people already if you just actually make a finished thing.


I am still a perfectionist sort of person, but when your work entails publishing 10-20 things in public every single day, you have to let go of that. Good enough is better than nothing at all.
Embrace your inner little baby (with really good taste):
I essentially have to get back to feeling like I&#x27;m a little baby to make things that are good. A baby with really good taste.

                  <p>In the 60s and 70s, Howard Johnson&#x27;s was the largest restaurant chain in the US — the restaurants and their associated hotels were ubiquitous while travelling America&#x27;s roadways. So it made sense that when Stanley Kubrick needed a hospitality brand for the Earthlight Room on the space station circling Earth in 2001: A Space Odyssey, he reached for HoJo&#x27;s.
And of course, even in 1968, you had to do some sort of cross-promotion and, bizarrely, what Howard Johnson&#x27;s came up with was a 2001-themed children&#x27;s menu.

Even more weirdly, the menu is not about the movie itself, it&#x27;s about a family that goes to see the movie. The whole opening sequence with the apes is omitted entirely, as is the HAL 9000 (arguably the film&#x27;s main character) — I suspect the HoJo&#x27;s people didn&#x27;t get to see the entire movie while putting this together (as evidenced by the &quot;preview edition&quot; graphic in the bottom right corner of the menu&#x27;s cover). 

It&#x27;s cool to see scenes from the movie rendered in comics form:


You can see the entire menu here, including the activity page — just click on one of the images to enter slideshow mode. (via meanwhile)

Great stuff. He&#x27;s also done Nirvana&#x27;s Smells Like Teen Spirit, Prodigy&#x27;s Firestarter, and Queen&#x27;s I Want to Break Free. (via @faketv)

                  <p>Using data from the ESA&#x27;s Mars Express probe, the German Aerospace Center has released an enhanced color image of Mars that shows off the planet&#x27;s geology and mineral content better than the usual dusty red photos do. Here&#x27;s part of what you&#x27;re seeing:
It is well known that most of Mars is reddish in colour, due to the high amount of oxidised iron in the dust on its surface, earning it the nickname the &#x27;Red Planet&#x27;. But it is also immediately noticeable that a considerable region of Mars is rather dark, appearing bluish in colour in image 1. These regions represent greyish-blackish-bluish sands, which are volcanic in origin and form large, dark sand layers on Mars. They were primarily piled up by the wind to form imposing sand dunes or enormous dune fields on the floor of impact craters. These unweathered sands consist of dark, basaltic minerals, of which volcanic lava on Earth is also composed. Basalt is the most widespread volcanic rock on Earth — and in the Solar System. Earth&#x27;s ocean floor is made of basalt, as are the extinct volcanoes of the Eifel, Mount Etna in Sicily and volcanoes of the Hawaiian archipelago.


In my mind, the best bit is how much clearer you can see the various geographical features of the planet. (via bad astronomy)

                  <p>According to recent research from linguists Phillip Carter and Kristen D&#x27;Alessandro Merii, a new dialect of English is forming in South Florida. The dialect, distinct from Spanglish, is spoken English that borrows lexical and semantic rules translated from Spanish. Carter writes:
For example, we found people to use expressions such as &quot;get down from the car&quot; instead of &quot;get out of the car.&quot; This is based on the Spanish phrase &quot;bajar del carro,&quot; which translates, for speakers outside of Miami, as &quot;get out of the car.&quot; But &quot;bajar&quot; means &quot;to get down,&quot; so it makes sense that many Miamians think of &quot;exiting&quot; a car in terms of &quot;getting down&quot; and not &quot;getting out.&quot;
Locals often say &quot;married with,&quot; as in &quot;Alex got married with Jos&#x27;e,&quot; based on the Spanish &quot;casarse con&quot; — literally translated as &quot;married with.&quot; They&#x27;ll also say &quot;make a party,&quot; a literal translation of the Spanish &quot;hacer una fiesta.&quot;
We also found &quot;semantic calques,&quot; or loan translations of meaning. In Spanish, &quot;carne,&quot; which translates as &quot;meat,&quot; can refer to both all meat, or to beef, a specific kind of meat. We discovered local speakers saying &quot;meat&quot; to refer specifically to &quot;beef&quot; — as in, &quot;I&#x27;ll have one meat empanada and two chicken empanadas.&quot;


I particularly liked this one:
We found that some expressions were used only among the immigrant generation — for example, &quot;throw a photo,&quot; from &quot;tirar una foto,&quot; as a variation of &quot;take a photo.&quot;

                  <p>This short video from Vox takes a look at the recent Supreme Court decision that struck down a gerrymandered congressional map in Alabama. 
In 2013, a divided Supreme Court gutted one of the major pillars of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. In the 10 years since then, the court has moved even farther to the right. So when the Voting Rights Act came before the Supreme Court again in 2022, it didn&#x27;t look good for the law. But then something completely unexpected happened: in a 5-4 decision, two of the conservative justices voted with the 3 liberal justices to preserve the Voting Rights Act. And the effects could be huge.
At stake in the case was the way that Alabama divides up its Congressional districts. Alabama has seven districts, one of which is what&#x27;s called a &quot;majority-minority district&quot; in which Black Americans are the majority of the population. In 2022, a group of Black voters sued the state, saying that under the law, Alabama should actually have two majority-minority districts. And the Supreme Court agreed.


The decision could affect recently redrawn district maps in other states, which could in turn affect the balance of power in the House of Representatives. You can read more about these gerrymandering cases at the Brennan Center for Justice: Allen v. Milligan: Gerrymandering at the Supreme Court (Formerly Merrill v. Milligan) and Redistricting Litigation Roundup.

                  <p>In roughly the time it took you to read this sentence, Max Park solved a Rubik&#x27;s Cube. With his time of 3.13 seconds, Park bested Yusheng Du&#x27;s 2018 mark of 3.47 seconds. Just watch the video above...it&#x27;s ridiculous. I love how the judge comes in to preserve the scene as everyone goes bananas.
Park was one of the subjects of the excellent documentary, The Speed Cubers (trailer).

                  <p>NASA keeps the original film negatives from the Apollo program sealed in a frozen vault in Houston, TX and rarely grants access to them. As a result, nearly all of the photos we see of those historic missions were made decades ago or are copies of copies. Recently, the film was cleaned and digitally scanned at &quot;an unprecedented resolution&quot;.
Using these new high-res scans, image specialist Andy Saunders remastered each of the 35,000 photographs, resulting in this incredible-looking book, Apollo Remastered: The Ultimate Photographic Record. From the book&#x27;s website:
The photographs from the lunar surface are as close as we can get to standing on the Moon ourselves, and for the first time, we were able to look back at Earth from afar, experiencing the &quot;overview effect&quot; — the cognitive shift that elicits an intense emotional experience upon seeing our home planet from space for the first time. The &quot;Blue Marble&quot; photograph, taken as Apollo 17 set course for the Moon, depicts the whole sunlit Earth, and is the most reproduced photograph of all time. Along with Apollo 8&#x27;s &quot;Earthrise,&quot; which depicts Earth above the lunar horizon, it was a catalyst for the environmental movement that continues today.


Saunders is also selling prints of some of these remastered photos, which look absolutely stunning.

                  <p>I was totally fascinated by this look at the absurd logistics of concert tours and now have a newfound appreciation for all the people involved who collaborate to make the magic happen (and perhaps also a little bit more forgiving about the high price of tickets (but Ticketmaster can still go to hell)).
Now, to an outsider, the load out process might look chaotic, and the pace of the tour may seem unsustainable or unmanageable. But though grueling and exhaustingly complicated, these massive, nation-wide tours function remarkably smoothly considering the variety of variables.

                  <p>After 14-year-old Preston Mutanga&#x27;s Lego version of the trailer for Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse (embedded above) went viral, the team hired him to animate a short Lego sequence for the actual film.
In the brief scene, we see a Lego version of Peter Parker as he observes a dimensional anomaly and sneaks off to the Daily Bugle&#x27;s bathroom to alert another Spider-Man about the issue. While the scene is short, it killed in my theater and it also looked as good as anything in the recent Lego films. After seeing it, a few friends of mine even commented that it must have been the same team that animated it. But nope! It was a lone teenager, actually.

                  <p>In 1979, just a few short years before she hit it big as a pop artist, Madonna was in a post-punk rock band called The Breakfast Club — she sang and played the drums. In the video above, the band rips through four demo songs in just over 8 minutes. From Dangerous Minds, some context:
Hardcore fans will also know Madonna has been known to perform versions of these songs (and other early material) live. Here&#x27;s the thing — much like the early days of the Go-Go&#x27;s, Madonna is definitely flexing her affinity for punk rock while mixing it with her own brand of spirited pop which the entire world would soon embrace and others would emulate. Now, if you&#x27;ve never heard this version of Madonna, and dig your punk with a side of pop, you are going to love these raw jams. It&#x27;s also quite compelling to hear them, knowing what was to come from Madonna in a few short years.

                  <p>The Atlas of the United States Printed for the Use of the Blind, published in 1837 before Braille was widely used, used embossed printing of lines, words, and symbols to be finger-readable.

Without a drop of ink in the book, the text and maps in this extraordinary atlas were embossed heavy paper with letters, lines, and symbols. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first atlas produced for the blind to read without the assistance of a sighted person. Braille was invented by 1825, but was not widely used until later. It represented letters well, but could not represent shapes and cartographic features.

                  <p>Icelandic filmmaker Jón Karl Helgason has made a film called Sundlaugasögur (Swimming Pool Stories) about the central role of the swimming pool in Icelandic life. The trailer is above. From Fatherly:
The swimming pool is first and foremost a communal space. &quot;The swimming pool is your second home,&quot; Helgason says. &quot;You are brought up in the swimming pool.&quot; There may be only 160, or so, swimming pools in the entire country (which is roughly 305 miles wide by 105 miles long), but every one of them is the essential social hub of a community, large or small.
The swimming pool is a public utility — as critical as the grocery store or the bank. &quot;The British go to the pub, the French go to the cafes — in our culture, you meet in the swimming pool,&quot; says Helgason. Swimmers come from all walks of life, from farmers to artists to clergymen to celebrities. &quot;You can have 10, 15, 20, 30 people [in the pool] — they&#x27;re talking about politics and about their lives.&quot;

                  <p>Astronomers believe that there&#x27;s a black hole at the center of almost every large galaxy in the universe. Some of those black holes are particularly energetic, chewing up the galaxies in which they reside and releasing massive amounts of energy out into the cosmos. Those black holes and the energy emitted from matter and gas falling towards their centers are what astronomers call quasars.
But if we look closely, we see who is actually in charge. Small as a grain of sand compared to the filaments, the centers of some of these galaxies shine with the power of a trillion stars, blasting out huge jets of matter, completely reshaping the cosmos around them. Quasars, the single most powerful objects in existence, so powerful that they can kill a galaxy.

                  <p>For the New Yorker, Louisa Thomas on major league pitcher Daniel Bard, who has struggled with the yips on and off during his career.
Many baseball players have minor control issues at one point or another. Sometimes it happens after an injury, when a player is relearning how to throw, over-attending to discrete motions that used to feel fluid and natural. &quot;Overthinking&quot; is the simple way to put it: the brain&#x27;s prefrontal cortex trips up the sensory cortex and the motor cortex. In other cases, the mind can essentially go blank. Players usually snap out of it, the way Bard had years before. But the brain can get stuck in certain patterns, and the yips can take over in a way that no one fully understands.

                  <p>We did it again, internet
If you’ll recall, once upon a time I managed to get my Wii Balance Board to connect to my computer and function as a scale.
At some point throughout the years, Linux changed, and that method broke.
It would still measure your weight fine, but you could no longer activate the balance board by tapping its front button, you had to flip it over, remove the battery compartment lid and press the red button every time.
This was too much of a hassle, so I stopped using the board, hoping that a solution to this problem would arrive one day to liberate me from the scourge of adipose tissue.
This day is today (well, a few months ago, actually, but I couldn’t be arsed writing about it until today, so).
I received an email from a reader called Jawaad Mahmood, who had read my balance board article and spent a bit of time figuring out how to get the balance board to work, and packaged his work into a library called bbev.
I was initially sceptical because many people contacted me throughout the years, but nobody managed to get rid of the red button requirement.
Talking to Jawaad for a bit, though, he confirmed that he could painlessly get the board to pair with his computer with the front button.
Apparently something had changed in the Linux Bluetooth stack, and made pairing possible again, and he managed to figure out how.
This was great news!

                  <p>I love Passkeys so much
I am unreasonably excited about Passkeys, I’ve long been looking for a better/more convenient way than passwords to do authentication, and I think Passkeys are finally it.
However, whenever I see Passkeys mentioned (for example on the recent Tailscale post about them), there are always a lot of misconceptions that surface in the debate.
I’d like to clear some of them here, and hopefully explain a bit better what Passkeys are.
A bit of backstory
Passkeys are a user-friendly name for, and an implementation of WebAuthn, which in turn is part of the FIDO2 project.
All that is basically a way to say that Passkeys are an open standard, developed by a consortium of companies that want to make authentication more secure and more usable.
My personal opinion is that Passkeys are a great solution to that problem, and that’s why I’m so excited about them.
At their core, Passkeys are just a way for a website to ask your browser for authentication.
That’s it, they aren’t tied to a specific piece of hardware or a way for that hardware to work.
I’ll expound more on this further on.

                  <p>As of June 8, 2023, we will no longer update this website (www.lowtechmagazine.com). New articles and comments will only appear on the solar-powered website of Low-tech Magazine, if the weather allows it. The old website remains online until we have moved all articles, which we plan for July 2023. Once we have finished the migration, this website disappears, and the web address will point to the solar website. Subscribers do not have to do anything: they will keep receiving newsletters and feed updates.</p>

                  <p>Noh is a classical Japanese art of dramatic dance that&#x27;s been performed since the 14th century. The masks worn by characters are an art form in themselves, and in this video, an expert craftsperson carves a noh mask out of a single block of Japanese cypress and then paints it with pigments made from crushed seashells.
I love the look of the rough texture of the mask when she&#x27;s about halfway through, before she smoothes it out with the paint — it&#x27;s like IRL low-poly. But the detail of the finished product is incredible.

                  <p>Totally loving this Chinese movie poster for Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (perhaps designed by Huang Hai).
And while we&#x27;re on the subject, I watched the movie the other day and loved it. In fact, it might be the most visually inventive movie I&#x27;ve ever seen...it&#x27;s just one mindbending visual after another, for more than two hours. (via @gray)

Talking about the news, excerpting it, linking to it, quoting it – these are all beneficial, normal news activities. If you can&#x27;t talk about the news, it&#x27;s not news – it&#x27;s a secret. But tech does steal from news. A variety of monopolistic tricks allows tech to interpose itself between reporters, publishers and outlets, and the audiences they serve.

                  <p>If you watch the video above of a front-facing camera on a moving train, the train appears to move much faster in the zoomed out view than in the zoomed in view. Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s going on:
The illusion that speed decreases when zoomed is &quot;because when one focuses on an inner portion of the movie, the optic flow angular speed is slow, and appears to fill one&#x27;s entitle visual field, which is consistent with overall lower forward speed.
Note: The more zoomed, the more densely packed the overhead rigging appears. So, even though you appear to be moving forward more slowly when zoomed in, the actual rate of rigging flowing by remains constant, consistent with same forward speed in all conditions.

                  <p>Blackstar is a relaxing and meditative 45-minute video of the Sun made by Seán Doran using footage from the Solar Dynamics Observatory. Instead of the familiar yellow, Doran has chosen to outfit our star in vivid blue and black, which lends the video a sort of alien familiarity. This looks absolutely stunning in 4K.

Four new methods allow you to change arrays without having to create a copy first. The new methods are &#x60;with()&#x60;, &#x60;toSorted()&#x60;, &#x60;toReversed()&#x60; and &#x60;toSpliced()&#x60;. No need to create a copy with &#x60;[...arr]&#x60; first. Only […]</p>

                  <p>Yesterday I posted a link to a Twitter thread by Stanley Kubrick scholar Filippo Ulivieri about a previously overlooked (*ahem*) aspect of The Shining: Jack Nicholson breaks the fourth wall by micro-glancing at the camera dozens of times during the film. It turns out that Ulivieri also made a visual essay about this and it&#x27;s really worth a watch.
Let&#x27;s go back to that glance that has been noticed by a few film critics. Some say it&#x27;s a Brechtian effect to expose the artifice of the mise en scène and have the audience reflect on the film medium. But Kubrick&#x27;s films are not intellectual, despite what the critics say. &quot;The truth of a thing,&quot; Kubrick said, &quot;is in the feel of it, not in the think of it.&quot; If this look at the camera means anything, for me it means that we are not safe from Jack&#x27;s …</p>

I used to do December holiday gift guides and really enjoyed the process, so this is me dipping my toe back into the gift guide water after a three-year absence.
Note: if you&#x27;re shopping for a fishing/hunting/golfing dad, this list might not be that useful. Read on if your dad is a tech/design/culture dork like me — this is all stuff I wouldn&#x27;t mind getting or already own myself.
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom for Nintendo Switch. This game has gotten such good reviews that the only thing holding me back from getting it is the knowledge that I have other things in my life that I cannot completely neglect for the next three weeks.

Golden Girls &#x3D; Elderly Sex and the City
Some of these would make pretty good Midjourney prompts but I will leave that as an exercise to the reader.1

Mostly because I&#x27;ve never had the patience to figure out the Rube Goldbergian process for using Midjourney. Step 1: sign up for an account on a gamers chat app??! No thank you.↩

One of my favorites is The Poggendorff Triangles, which goes to show you that straight lines aren&#x27;t always straight:

Here&#x27;s an audio illusion that sounds as though the tempo is endlessly rising (similar to the Shepard tone):

                  <p>A few years ago I gave a short talk (slides)
about myths that discourage people from blogging. I was chatting with a friend
about blogging the other day and it made me want to write up that talk as a
blog post.
here are the myths:
myth: you need to be original
myth: you need to be an expert
myth: posts need to be 100% correct
myth: writing boring posts is bad
myth: you need to explain every concept
myth: page views matter
myth: more material is always better
myth: you need to be original
This is probably the one I hear the most often – “Someone has written about
this before! Who’s going to care about what I have to say?“.
The main way I think about this personally is:
identify something I personally have found confusing or interesting
write about it
The idea is that if I found it confusing…</p>

                  <p>To effectively combat the climate crisis, we&#x27;re going to need to remove carbon from the atmosphere. But what&#x27;s the best way to do it? Two of the main solutions being considered are direct carbon capture technology and growing trees and each approach has its pros and cons.
Carbon removal is a catch-all term for anything that people do that pulls CO2 out of the air and stores it somewhere else. To meet the world&#x27;s climate goals, we would need to do this on a massive scale — anywhere from 440 billion to 1.1 trillion metric tons before the end of the century. That&#x27;s more carbon than the U.S. has emitted in its entire history.
So how do we remove all that carbon? There are two carbon removal ideas that have really captured the conversation. One is direct air capture, which involves big factories that suck in tons of CO2 from the atmosphere, chemically concentrate it, and store it deep in the ground. The other idea is to simply plant trees! After all, trees have naturally sequestered carbon for millions of years.

Written and &quot;Directed&quot; by Paul Trillo.


Kyle Chayka talked to Trillo about his process for the New Yorker:
Trillo demonstrated the process to me during a Zoom call; in seconds, it was possible to render, for example, a tracking shot of a woman crying alone in a softly lit restaurant. His prompt included a hash of S.E.O.-esque terms meant to goad the machine into creating a particularly cinematic aesthetic: &quot;Moody lighting, iconic, visually stunning, immersive, impactful.&quot; Trillo was enthralled by the process: &quot;The speed in which I could operate was unlike anything I had experienced.&quot; He continued, &quot;It felt like being able to fly in a dream.&quot; The A.I. tool was &quot;co-directing&quot; alongside him: &quot;It&#x27;s making a lot of decisions I didn&#x27;t.&quot;

                  <p>I recently did an interview about speed running Monkey Island (I&#x27;ll post a link when it&#x27;s available).
One of the topics was how speed runners dislike random events and the end of Monkey Island 2 has a lot of randomness around when LeChuck appears. I was asked how this worked and to be honest that was a long time ago and I don&#x27;t remember every little scape of code. It is also possible that I didn&#x27;t write it.  But what I do have is the SCUMM source code for Monkey Island 2 and I tracked down the code.
lechuck-appearance-chance is 4
lechuck-appearance-interval is 300
times-lechucks-appeared-recently +&#x3D; 1
foo &#x3D; (3 - times-lechucks-appeared-recently)
foo &#x3D; (random foo)
if (!foo) {     ; after he&#x27;s popped up a couple times he&#x27;s likely to disappear for a while
    times-lechucks-appeared-recently &#x3D; 0
    lechuck-appearance-chance is 10 ; that is, 1 in 10
    lechuck-appearance-interval is 500
}
if (magic-doll) {   ; speed him way up after you make the doll
    if (owner-of needle is selected-actor) {    ; and have the needle
        lechuck-appearance-chance is 2
        lechuck-appearance-interval is 120
    }
}
There are some other random conditions about what item you picked up last, etc, but this is the core of it.
P.S. If you&#x27;re wondering my SCUMM uses - in variable names, it&#x27;s because it started out as a variant of LISP.
P.P.S. It&#x27;s also worth noting that this is for the original MI2, The special editions and SCUMMVM might have changed how this works.</p>

                  <p>In this short video from the BBC narrated by Helena Bonham Carter, activist and actor George Takei talks about his imprisonment in an American concentration camp during WWII because he was of Japanese descent.
I began school in Rohwer, a real school, in a black tar paper barrack. There was an American flag hanging at the front of the classroom and on the first morning, the teacher said, &quot;We&#x27;re going begin every morning with the pledge of allegiance to the flag. I will teach it to you and you are to memorize that.&quot; But I could see right outside my schoolhouse window the barbed wire fence and the sentry tower as I recited the words &quot;with liberty and justice for all&quot;. An innocent kid, too young to understand the stinging irony in those words.


Takei has done many talks &amp; interviews over the years about his experience, including for the Archive of American Television, Democracy Now!, and a TED Talk back in 2014:

He also published a graphic novel about his time in the camps called They Called Us Enemy.

                  <p>Capture the Atlas have announced their picks for the 2023 Milky Way Photographer of the Year competition. As usual, I&#x27;ve included a few of my favorites here — from top to bottom: Jakob Sahner&#x27;s photo from the Canary Islands, Mihail Minkov&#x27;s composite shot of the Milky Way as it looks in both the summer &amp; winter, and Steffi Lieberman amongst the baobab trees in Madagascar. Here&#x27;s Minkov explaining his full-galactic view:
I&#x27;ve always wondered what the night sky would look like if we could see the two Milky Way arches from the winter and summer side by side. This is practically impossible, since they are part of a whole and are visible at different times of the day.
However, this 360-degree time-blended panorama shows us what they would look like. The two arches of the Milky Way represent one object in the starry sky, with part of it visible in winter and part of it in summer. Therefore, they are called the winter and summer arches. The winter arch includes objects that we can observe from October to March, primarily associated with the constellation Orion.
On the other hand, the summer arch features the Milky Way core, visible from March to September, which is the most characteristic and luminous part of the night sky, representing the center of our galaxy.

                  <p>Ok this is kind of incredible: Brick Technology built a solar-powered Lego clock that will keep time for a billion years. It&#x27;s got various displays in the style of an astronomical clock so you can keep track of seconds, hours, months, centuries, and even galactical years (the amount of time the Sun takes to orbit the center of the galaxy). The clock is powered by solar energy, and the solar cell is connected to the clock so that it tilts throughout the day to keep facing the sun. 
This is a) an extremely accessible explanation of how clocks work, b) the nerdiest thing ever, and c) I love it so much. Even if you&#x27;re not a Lego fan, you should watch this. (For more on how clocks work, check out Bartosz Ciechanowski&#x27;s excellent explainer on mechanical watches.)
The obvious thing that sprung to mind watching this was The Clock of the Long Now, a 10,000-year clock being constructed inside a mountain in West Texas. But I also thought of Arthur Ganson&#x27;s Machine With Concrete, which utilizes extreme gear ratios to turn an input of 200 rpm into a gear that turns only once every 2 trillion years. That&#x27;s slow enough that the final gear is actually embedded in concrete and it doesn&#x27;t affect the operation of the machine at all.

                  <p>Hey everyone! This is the list of all the changes we&#x27;ve done to our projects and apps during the month of June. We&#x27;ll also be reporting in our on position in the world, and on our future plans.
Summary Of Changes
100r.co, added propeller maintenance, Maple Bay, Telegraph Cove, Smuggler Cove and Princess Louisa Inlet.
Wiktopher, added back the revised/corrected version of Chapter 10, back online, and Chapter 11 has been corrected but is not yet live.
UxnFor, created an uxntal code formatter.
Bicycle, added lots of little improvements.
Adelie, added speaker&#x27;s notes and a pen mode.
News
Pino spent the first few days of the month on land, having its bottom re-painted, and its various bits serviced and checked. We took our propeller apart for the first time.
We&#x27;ve added a few write-ups of our travels so far (see above entry with links under 100r.co), but the most significant one is our 46nmi sail up to Princess Louisa Inlet, a long fjord on British Columbia&#x27;s Sunshine Coast, with an incredible gem at the end. It is an amazing, and unique place. We&#x27;re glad we finally got to go. As we write this, we are in Roscoe Bay on West Redonda Island, tethering off a phone hoisted up the mast (it works quite well).
This summer we are power stable. We had issues last year because of parisitic draws due to old wiring (see DC electrical refit), but now everything is working as it should. We&#x27;re charging our computers without an inverter, and that too is working out quite well so far (see charging electronics).
Together, Hikari and Lynn made chibicc-uxn, a c compiler for Uxn, and with it also released a port of the classic software Neko(xneko, oneko sakura).
Pino book &amp; movie club
We are reading Arkady and Boris Strugatsky&#x27;s Roadside Picnic. We&#x27;ve been re-watching Kaamelott(the series, book 1 though 6) for the hundredth time.

That matters, because if we create pseudo-copyrights over the facts of the news, or headlines, or snippets to help news companies bargain with tech companies, we make the news partners with the tech companies, rather than watchdogs. How does tech steal money from the news? Lots of ways! …</p>

Doctor Who&#x27;s Jon Pertwee interviews Star Trek&#x27;s William Shatner in this clip from the early 90s. Crazy crossover! Pertwee offhandedly mentions that Steven Spielberg was interested in doing a Doctor Who reboot?!

                  <p>Richard Swarbrick makes these great impressionist animations of sports events, mostly soccer but also cricket and basketball. Here&#x27;s one to get you started...the 5-0 drubbing FC Barcelona handed to Real Madrid during a 2010 Clasico:

It&#x27;s amazing how much Swarbrick&#x27;s illustrations communicate with so few strokes...Mourinho&#x27;s face is my favorite. Here&#x27;s the actual match for comparison purposes. And here&#x27;s Maradona&#x27;s sublime goal against England in the 1986 World Cup (original video):

You can find many other examples of Swarbrick&#x27;s work on his web site and on his YouTube channel. (via @dunstan)

                  <p>In 2015, artist Olafur Eliasson designed the Circle Bridge (Cirkelbroen) to span a canal in central Copenhagen. The pedestrian bridge was designed to slow people down a bit:
The bridge is made of five circular platforms, and it contributes to a larger circle that will form a pedestrian route around Copenhagen Harbour, where people — cycling, running, walking — can see the city from a very different perspective. As many as 5,000 people will cross this bridge each day. I hope that these people will use Cirkelbroen as a meeting place, and that the zigzag design of the bridge will make them reduce their speed and take a break. To hesitate on our way is to engage in bodily thought. I see such introspection as an essential part of a vibrant city.


Small boats can travel easily under the bridge but a section of the bridge also swings gracefully away to let larger boats pass. (via greg allen)

                  <p>In a Memorial Day reflection, historian Heather Cox Richardson highlights a pamphlet distributed by the US War Department to Army soldiers during World War II on the topic of fascism: what it is and how to combat it.
The War Department thought it was important for Americans to understand the tactics fascists would use to take power in the United States. They would try to gain power &quot;under the guise of &#x27;super-patriotism&#x27; and &#x27;super-Americanism.&#x27;&quot; And they would use three techniques:
First, they would pit religious, racial, and economic groups against one another to break down national unity. Part of that effort to divide and conquer would be a &quot;well-planned &#x27;hate campaign&#x27; against minority races, religions, and other groups.&quot;
Second, they would deny any need for international cooperation, because that would fly in the face of their insistence that their supporters were better than everyone else. &quot;In place of international cooperation, the fascists seek to substitute a perverted sort of ultra-nationalism which tells their people that they are the only people in the world who count. With this goes hatred and suspicion toward the people of all other nations.&quot;
Third, fascists would insist that &quot;the world has but two choices — either fascism or communism, and they label as &#x27;communists&#x27; everyone who refuses to support them.&quot;
It is &quot;vitally important&quot; to learn to spot native fascists, the government said, &quot;even though they adopt names and slogans with popular appeal, drape themselves with the American flag, and attempt to carry out their program in the name of the democracy they are trying to destroy.&quot;

                  <p>The Inouye Solar Telescope is the largest and most powerful solar telescope in the world. The telescope is still in a &quot;learning and transitioning period&quot; and not up to full operational speed, but scientists at the National Solar Observatory recently released a batch of images that hint at what it&#x27;s capable of. Several of the photos feature sunspots, cooler regions of the Sun with strong magnetic fields.
The sunspots pictured are dark and cool regions on the Sun&#x27;s &quot;surface&quot;, known as the photosphere, where strong magnetic fields persist. Sunspots vary in size, but many are often the size of Earth, if not larger. Complex sunspots or groups of sunspots can be the source of explosive events like flares and coronal mass ejections that generate solar storms. These energetic and eruptive phenomena influence the outermost atmospheric layer of the Sun, the heliosphere, with the potential to impact Earth and our critical infrastructure.
In the quiet regions of the Sun, the images show convection cells in the photosphere displaying a bright pattern of hot, upward-flowing plasma (granules) surrounded by darker lanes of cooler, down-flowing solar plasma. In the atmospheric layer above the photosphere, called the chromosphere, we see dark, elongated fibrils originating from locations of small-scale magnetic field accumulations.

                  <p>Slightly branching out from the usual western handhelds, I&#x27;ve seen WonderSwans but never played around. Then managed to pick up a faulty &quot;Color&quot; model for £40 on eBay listed as not working.
On inspection it looked, internally, very clean - no corrosion or damage. From my experience with Pokémon Mini handhelds, I was wondering if perhaps the power button wasn&#x27;t getting the signal.
So I applied a slice of kitchen tin foil, some sticky tape and voilà, it powers up! I had to also apply it to the sound and start button (and I&#x27;ll probably make this permanent with conductive paint one day), but otherwise it&#x27;s all good.
(And I snagged a flash cart so I was able to experience some translated romhacks too)</p>

                  <p>Oh this is so nerdy and great: Veritasium introduces us to Micromouse, a maze-solving competition in which robotic mice compete to see which one is the fastest through a maze. The competitions have been held since the late 70s and today&#x27;s mice are marvels of engineering and software, the result of decades of small improvements alongside bigger jumps in performance.
I love stuff like this because the narrow scope (single vehicle, standard maze), easily understood constraints, and timed runs, combined with Veritasium&#x27;s excellent presentation, makes it really easy to understand how innovation works. The cars got faster, smaller, and learned to corner better, but those improvements created new challenges which needed other solutions to overcome to bring the times down even more. So cool.

                  <p>The length of a human life is around 80 years. You might get 100 if you&#x27;re lucky. The universe is about 13.7 billion years old. The vast difference between a human lifespan and the age of the universe can be difficult to grasp — even the words we use in attempting to describe it (like &quot;vast&quot;) are comically insufficient.
To help us visualize what a difference of eight orders of magnitude might look like, Wylie Overstreet and Alex Gorosh have created a scale model of time in the Mojave Desert, from the Big Bang to the present day. This is really worth watching and likely to make you think some big think thoughts about your place in the universe and in your life.
This is a followup of the scale model of the solar system they built and a video they made about people seeing the Moon through a telescope for the first time.

                  <p>Last week, popular YouTuber, author, and science communicator Hank Green announced that he had cancer (very treatable Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma). His video announcement was part of a series of back-and-forth videos he does with his brother John Green, popular YouTuber and novelist. John replied to Hank&#x27;s video with a short one of his own, noting that humor is one way that people deal with grief but also a way in which we can accompany people through tough times.

To work, the humor has to feel like love rather than judgment, like inclusion rather than stigma, and like celebration rather than dismissal. And that&#x27;s a tough balance. Sometimes well-intentioned people, including me, get it wrong. And it also depends on, like, who&#x27;s saying it and the context.


Good luck and my warmest thoughts to the Greens and their family as they navigate this difficult time. And, you know, fuck cancer.

                  <p>Hand Talk sign language has been used by indigenous communities for thousands of years as a lingua franca between groups and tribes that didn&#x27;t share a common spoken language. Hand Talk is an endangered endangered — the US government tried to eradicate indigenous languages starting the late 1800s — but it&#x27;s still in use today.
This was fascinating. For example, as with all languages, Hand Talk vocabulary reveals how they thought about everyday concepts like time:
For example, let&#x27;s take the simple question: &quot;How old are you?&quot; First, there&#x27;s a single sign for &quot;question.&quot; So for a question about someone&#x27;s age, you&#x27;d use the motion for question with the motion for &quot;winter&quot;. How many winters are you? That&#x27;s what I ask. In PISL you measure months by moons, days by the sun. And to refer to different times of day, you would show hand placement according to the position of the sun in the sky. So this sign for morning, afternoon, or night.


Hand Talk was also one of the influences on ASL and the borrowing of vocabulary between the two language groups continues.

                  <p>Hello! Today we’re releasing a new playground called “memory spy”. It lets you run C programs
and see how their variables are represented in memory. It’s designed to be
accessible to folks who don’t know C – it comes with bunch of extremely simple
example C programs that you can poke at. Here’s the link:
Memory Spy &lt;&lt;


This is a companion to the “how integers and floats work” zine we’ve been
working on, so the goal is mostly to look at how number types (integers and
floats) are represented.
why spy on memory?
How computers actually represent variables can seem kind of abstract, so  I
wanted to make it easy for folks to see how a real computer actually represents
variables in memory.
why is it useful to look at C?
You might be wondering – I don’t write C! Why should I care how C programs

                  <p>Relying on the choices of 177 book experts from 56 different countries, BBC Culture recently chose the 100 greatest children&#x27;s books of all time. The top five are:
1. Where the Wild Things Are by Maurice Sendak
Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll
Pippi Longstocking by Astrid Lindgren
The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry
The Hobbit by JRR Tolkien
In terms of Sendak, I always preferred In the Night Kitchen to Where the Wild Things Are. Here are a few of my personal favorites from the list:
14. The Very Hungry Caterpillar by Eric Carle
Goodnight Moon by Margaret Wise Brown
The Snowy Day by Ezra Jack Keats
The Lord of the Rings by JRR Tolkien
Danny the Champion of the World by Roald Dahl
Is the Lord of the Rings a children&#x27;s book? Young adult? And I would have liked to have seen Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs and Cars and Trucks and Things That Go on the list. And perhaps some Frog and Toad?

                  <p>Crazy article from the Smithsonian about a Russian family that disappeared into the Siberian wilderness in 1936 and had no contact with other people for more than 40 years. In the process, they missed World War II, the Moon landing, and the start of the Cold War.
...beside a stream there was a dwelling. Blackened by time and rain, the hut was piled up on all sides with taiga rubbish-bark, poles, planks. If it hadn&#x27;t been for a window the size of my backpack pocket, it would have been hard to believe that people lived there. But they did, no doubt about it.... Our arrival had been noticed, as we could see.
The low door creaked, and the figure of a very old man emerged into the light of day, straight out of a fairy tale. Barefoot. Wearing a patched and repatched shirt made of sacking. He wore trousers of the same material, also in patches, and had an uncombed beard. His hair was disheveled. He looked frightened and was very attentive.... We had to say something, so I began: &#x27;Greetings, grandfather! We&#x27;ve come to visit!&#x27;
The old man did not reply immediately.... Finally, we heard a soft, uncertain voice: &#x27;Well, since you have traveled this far, you might as well come in.&#x27;

                  <p>Back in 1991, a man bought a painting at a flea market for $4 because he liked the frame. Hidden behind the painting was an envelope containing a copy of the Declaration of Independence. It turned out to be one of approximately 200 copies of the Dunlap broadside, the first published copies of the historic document. From a contemporary NY Times article:
Mr. Redden described the document, found behind the painting when the collector took the frame apart, as an &quot;unspeakably fresh copy&quot; of the declaration. &quot;The fact that it has been in the backing of the frame preserved it,&quot; he said. Of the 24 copies known to survive, only 3 are in private hands, he added.


How &quot;unspeakably fresh&quot; was this particular copy? The ink wasn&#x27;t yet dry when it was folded into the envelope:
&quot;The ink was still wet on this copy when it was folded,&quot; Mr. Kiffer said. &quot;The very first line — &#x27;In Congress, July 4, 1776&#x27; — shows up in the bottom margin in reverse, as a faint offsetting or shadow printing, one more proof of the urgency John Dunlap, the printer, and others felt in dispersing this document.&quot;


The document sold for $2.2 million in 1991 and then sold again in 2000 for $7.4 million to legendary TV producer Norman Lear (All in the Family, The Jeffersons), who mounted a three-and-a-half year tour of the it across the US. (via my modern met)

                  <p>A high school here in Vermont is located (temporarily) in an abandoned Macy&#x27;s department store. A crew from the BBC recently made a short video tour, where you can see books on shelves designed to display fine china, an absence of windows, escalators, a lack of floor-to-ceiling walls, and fashion branding that remains on the walls.
Alexandra Lange wrote about the school in 2021 for Curbed.
The genre may be nearly dead, yet the building remains. And for economic, ecological, and social reasons, those buildings should be reused. &quot;It&#x27;s amazing to think that we are standing in what used to be a department store; that we&#x27;re greeting people where we used to buy winter coats; reading books where they once sold fine china; taking phone calls in converted changing rooms; and learning science in the old suit racks,&quot; Burlington&#x27;s school superintendent, Tom Flanagan, said at the ceremony. A school in a department store doesn&#x27;t have to be a sad story. In fact, this should just be the beginning, both for the students and for a country once addicted to big boxes.


Vermont indie newspaper Seven Days published a writeup, video tour, and photo slideshow of the school when it opened two years ago.

Life is something rare and precious. There is something extraordinary about the planet that we are privileged to live on. The human species is destroying forests and we&#x27;re doing it at a rate of one acre of forest every second. We&#x27;re doing something immensely stupid.

Along the way, they namecheck a variety of artists from many genres, including Woody Guthrie, Johnny Cash, The Beatles, The Who, Pink Floyd, Stevie Wonder, Kraftwerk, Iron Maiden, De La Soul, Arcade Fire, Daft Punk, Janelle Monáe, Kendrick Lamar, and Taylor Swift.

                  <p>Writing for The Atlantic, Sarah Zhang details how some people taking Ozempic for weight loss are reporting that the drug has also curbed their addictive impulses (to drink, to shop, to smoke).
Earlier this year, she began taking semaglutide, also known as Wegovy, after being prescribed the drug for weight loss. (Colloquially, it is often referred to as Ozempic, though that is technically just the brand name for semaglutide that is marketed for diabetes treatment.) Her food thoughts quieted down. She lost weight. But most surprisingly, she walked out of Target one day and realized her cart contained only the four things she came to buy. &quot;I&#x27;ve never done that before,&quot; she said. The desire to shop had slipped away. The desire to drink, extinguished once, did not rush in as a replacement either. For the first time — perhaps the first time in her whole life — all of her cravings and impulses were gone. It was like a switch had flipped in her brain.


Not everyone experiences these effects, but there&#x27;s enough anecdotal evidence at this point that scientists are interested and investigating.

                  <p>For the NY Times, Jamelle Bouie takes a look at the legislation that Republicans around the country are pushing and, in the style of FDR&#x27;s Four Freedoms speech, outlines what goals they are attempting to achieve.
There is the freedom to control — to restrict the bodily autonomy of women and repress the existence of anyone who does not conform to traditional gender roles.
There is the freedom to exploit — to allow the owners of business and capital to weaken labor and take advantage of workers as they see fit.
There is the freedom to censor — to suppress ideas that challenge and threaten the ideologies of the ruling class.
And there is the freedom to menace — to carry weapons wherever you please, to brandish them in public, to turn the right of self-defense into a right to threaten other people.


That sounds about right, and it reminds me, as Republican &quot;governance&quot; often does these days, of Frank Wilhoit&#x27;s definition of conservatism:
Conservatism consists of exactly one proposition, to wit: There must be in-groups whom the law protects but does not bind, alongside out-groups whom the law binds but does not protect.

                  <p>Large language models like GPT-4 are becoming increasingly capable, at an alarming rate. Within a couple of years, we won&#x27;t need developers any more! …Or at least, that&#x27;s the narrative going viral on Twitter. I&#x27;m much more optimistic about what these AI advancements mean for the future of software development.</p>

I still have a long way to go, but I’m proud to be able to finally share an early look at this new BlueSuburbia.

                  <p>Earlier this week, the retired electronic duo Daft Punk released the 10th anniversary edition of Random Access Memories, their last studio album. The anniversary album includes 35 minutes of previously unreleased music.
Among the tracks is a demo of Infinity Repeating, featuring Julian Casablancas and The Voidz, which a recent interview w/ Casablancas on Daft Punk&#x27;s YouTube channel called &quot;the last Daft Punk song, ever&quot;. The music video for Infinity Repeating, embedded above, features a cool evolution-of-humanity animation (with robots!) and is highly re-watchable.

                  <p>The First Folio is a collection of 36 plays by William Shakespeare that was published in 1623. One of the most influential books ever published, only about 230 copies are known to have survived. The Victoria and Albert Museum has three copies, and in this video, they lead the viewer on a tour through one of them.
There are 36 plays by Shakespeare in this book and half of them had not been previously printed. So this book preserves really half of Shakespeare&#x27;s complete works — plays that would probably have been completely lost to us include the Tempest, Macbeth, Twelfth Night, many others that are among people&#x27;s favorites today.

                  <p>I&#x27;ve been waiting patiently on this one: the teaser trailer for Killers of the Flower Moon, directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Leonardo DiCaprio. It&#x27;s based on the fantastic book by David Grann, Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI.
In the 1920s, the richest people per capita in the world were members of the Osage Nation in Oklahoma. After oil was discovered beneath their land, the Osage rode in chauffeured automobiles, built mansions, and sent their children to study in Europe.
Then, one by one, the Osage began to be killed off. The family of an Osage woman, Mollie Burkhart, became a prime target. One of her relatives was shot. Another was poisoned. And it was just the beginning, as more and more Osage were dying under mysterious circumstances, and many of those who dared to investigate the killings were themselves murdered.


The movie will be out in theaters on October 6. Oh, and Scorsese &amp; DiCaprio have already signed on to adapt Grann&#x27;s latest book, The Wager, which I recently read and loved.

                  <p>Right now in the US, the majority of children are driven to school, even though many of them live within walking or cycling distance.
In 1969, about 48% of students walked or cycled to school in the United States. Today that figure is about 11%. And this decline wasn&#x27;t just in the US — you can find the same trend in Australia, England, and Canada: today the majority of students are driven to school in a car. One of the larger studies we have on this issue in [British Columbia] found that 58% of 4th graders and 50% of 7th graders were driven to school by their parents.


There are various reasons for this shift, including that roads are unsafe for cyclists and pedestrians because of cars, a cultural shift towards greatly increased parental supervision of children, and inflexible parental work schedules.

                  <p>In this short video, Norwegian creative director Torger Jansen explains how he designed an unofficial transit map that combines all three of Oslo&#x27;s public transportation networks (tram, metro, train) into a single diagram. His four main goals:
1. Showing all the lines on every network, thus making it easier to understand the service patterns.


As Jansen notes, this is not how a design process would work in the real world — there&#x27;s no user testing or competing stakeholders to please — but from a purely aesthetic and functional standpoint, it&#x27;s still an interesting challenge and puzzle to attempt to solve. (thx, david)

                  <p>Well, I don&#x27;t think these photos of Icelandic ice caves by Ryan Newburn need much explanation. Stunning. I found these photos via Colossal, which has more information about how they were taken.
Occupying such an ancient and always evolving space is an experience that&#x27;s difficult to photograph, Newburn shares, because the constant trickle of melting water, the roar of distant rivers, or even the unique interplay of light and glacier are impossible to depict entirely. &quot;Underneath the ice, where the sun cannot penetrate,&quot; he says, &quot;your eyes slowly adjust from the bright sun to the glowing deep blue crystal walls of the ice cave. The more that your eyes adjust, the more saturated the blue gets. It&#x27;s a surreal visual experience that you cannot get from any photo of an ice cave.&quot;


If you&#x27;d like to see some of these places for yourself, Newburn runs a tour company called Ice Pic Journeys.

                  <p>I&#x27;ve always wondered about the process for making pieces of metal that appear to fit together perfectly, so perfectly that you can&#x27;t see any sort of cut or seam. In this video, Steve Mould explains how wire EDM works, in part using cheese.

                  <p>In Japan, people who disappear from their lives are called &quot;evaporated people&quot;. People choose to drop out of their lives for different reasons, ranging from debt or abuse to mental health struggles or a lack of second chances in Japanese society. Some Japanese who want to go into hiding or relocate from domestic abuse or stalkers hire &quot;night movers&quot; to help them disappear.
For more info, here&#x27;s a long piece from Time magazine from 2017.
Sometimes a whole team works on a client&#x27;s disappearance, swiftly sweeping through an apartment in the dead of night. At TS, it costs between ¥50,000 ($450) and ¥300,000 ($2,600) depending on the amount of possessions somebody wants to flee with, how far they&#x27;re going, and whether the move needs to happen under the cover of darkness. Taking along children, or evading debt collectors, can push prices higher. Every day, TS receives between five and 10 inquiries like the one Saita described. Most people simply require counseling or legal advice but the company claims to help between 100 and 150 people to vanish annually.

                  <p>Through the little Etsy store I&#x27;ve got, I offer Game Boy game repair mostly just so I get to &quot;play&quot; on different problems, and a different problem did arrive.
This Game Boy Advance game, although worked, requires a battery for the real time clock aspects of the game (i.e. timed events). The problem was that there was a repair attempt that had taken off the entire pad for the battery, and in fact had go through the pad, through the silk screen and had gone all the way into the fibre glass insulation layer (you might be able to see in the photo the woven pattern).
Before slapping a battery on and jumping the positive leg to the right component, I wanted to check that nothing else was missing. Thankfully the community have tried to preserve a lot of the history (in this case, the PCB traces) but also published it freely on the web.
From this I also found a resistor had been lost in the previous repair. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s clear from my photo, but what I did was to bond the missing resistor in a completely different location (before it traces to a capacitor) and then use a jumper wire from the replaceable battery case. This was mostly in case the battery case was torn off again it wouldn&#x27;t cause damage to the components on the board.
Once that was all done, the game happily had its clock and was returned to it&#x27;s owner the same day.</p>

                  <p>Artist Amy Goodchild recently published an engaging article about the earliest computer art from the 50s and 60s.
My original vision for this article was to cover the development of computer art from the 50&#x27;s to the 90&#x27;s, but it turns out there&#x27;s an abundance of things without even getting half way through that era. So in this article we&#x27;ll look at how Lovelace&#x27;s ideas for creativity with a computer first came to life in the 50&#x27;s and 60&#x27;s, and I&#x27;ll cover later decades in future articles. 
I stray from computer art into electronic, kinetic and mechanical art because the lines are blurred, it contributes to the historical context, and also because there is some cool stuff to look at.


Cool stuff indeed — I&#x27;ve included some of my favorite pieces that Goodchild highlighted above. (via waxy)

Moonlight, Uncut Gems, Everything Everywhere All At Once, Aftersun, The Tragedy of Macbeth, Eighth Grade, Lady Bird, The Lobster, Amy, Ex Machina. More recently, TV shows like Euphoria, Beef, and Erma Vep.
This video from Vox charts the rise of A24 from a small distributor to an Oscar-winning powerhouse that pumps out more movies each year than much bigger studios. See also The Cult of A24 (a good companion piece to the video above) and Every A24 Movie, Ranked.

                  <p>Cutting to the chase: text editors *and* tabs vs. spaces!  Ooooh!


I&#x27;ve had this thing called &quot;e&quot; for a while now.  It&#x27;s a stupid little 
script which serves to do a couple of things.  It starts my 
editor
with a given file, and it kicks it with the right arguments to make it 
disable line wrapping and to make the [TAB] key actually put in two 
spaces.


So, my dumb script would use &quot;-w -E -T 2&quot; most of the time, except when it 
was running on a Makefile, at which point it would skip those args.  
Simple enough, right?


pico is back?  Yes indeed, on Macs, as of 12.3, pico is in fact back.  To 
make sure I wasn&#x27;t imagining things, I tracked down a machine that hadn&#x27;t 
been upgraded yet and checked there.  Sure enough, it was in fact nano and 
not pico.


macOS 12.3 has nano as a symlink... pointing to pico!


At some point, I switched from literal tab characters in my source code to 
blobs of spaces, probably due to using that style at work and not hating 
it.  So, somewhere along the line I actually started depending on nano 
behavior without realizing it.


As for the lack of a feature in pico itself, it&#x27;s kind of strange, really.  
If you go digging into the source, they have this random.c with a function 
called tab which claims to &quot;simulate tab stop&quot; using spaces.  That said, I 
can&#x27;t find any place where it would be called with the magic values which 
would make it behave that way.


It wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if this switch is just more of Apple removing 
GPLed things from their OS - pico seems to use the Apache license.  They 
dumped bash for zsh (MIT license) at some point (Big Sur, I think), and 
now this?  Okay then.</p>

some situations back in the day... and might still be able to do in a 
few places today.


The problem is that while version X might eventually have an exploit, 
it&#x27;ll get removed and it&#x27;ll be replaced by version Y without that
particular hole.  By the time you get your hands on a tool to break into 
X, it&#x27;ll be gone.


What you&#x27;d do is create a hard link pointing at the file you wanted to 
preserve, storing it in a spot which was writable by your account.  
Then, say, /usr/bin/sudo (because that never has security 
issues...) gets replaced at some point with a new file and you get to 
keep the old version.  When you get the tool to pop it, off you go!


Of course, these days, it&#x27;s not quite so easy on the more modern systems 
you find.  Debian 11 here won&#x27;t let me do it - it&#x27;s EPERM city.  Rocky 8 
(so CentOS 8 and RHEL 8 too) also won&#x27;t do it.  They both have some gunk
in /usr/lib/sysctl.d to lock this down.  But, my old Slackware 14.2 
install of my workstation let me do it the last time I tried about 
a year ago.  How about that, huh?  I bet it&#x27;d still work if I dug out 
the old drives and booted them up.


Incidentally, this is the magic sauce: /proc/sys/fs/protected_hardlinks
Read the man page for proc(5) to learn more about it.

here it is,
the thread I read a long time ago.  It&#x27;s interesting to note that as far 
as I can tell, nothing actually changed upstream.  This left paranoid 
admins like me with no option but to use the (most excellent) Openwall 
patches to lock down this kind of stuff.  I used that on my machines at 
work which had non-staff users... just in case.


This whole situation is scary.

                  <p>Back in January, you might have seen my
post
about a very large BBS which seemed to solve for the problem of &quot;how do 
we host a bunch of users&quot; by having one physical box per user.  It might 
have been one physical box per *two* users, maybe, but it&#x27;s hard to say.


Now, keep in mind digital cameras weren&#x27;t easy to come by, so I have 
very few actual pictures.  I&#x27;ll have to do a lot of explaining to make 
up for the lack of detail and alternate angles.  Clearly, I had no 
notion of ever using these pictures to tell stories 25+ years later.


Some friends at a local company had some bandwidth to spare (a T1 to 
Alternet somewhere, as I recall), so they parked a Zoom modem on one of 
their boxes and plugged it into a phone line.  We got an identical model 
to avoid cross-brand issues (Zoom m…</p>

save them in case conditions change or other things happen and make me

offices before the whole COVID lockdown thing happened and people 
largely stopped going to offices every day.  With that in mind, let&#x27;s

However, tech companies decided to go past this at some point and 
brought about this whole notion of &quot;microkitchens&quot;.  This is where 
they&#x27;d put their branding on the coolers (instead of &quot;Coca-Cola&quot; or 
&quot;Pepsi&quot;) and would load it up with every kind of fizzy sugary liquid

                  <p>One of the fun things I used to do at a prior job was to dig through the 
raw data points which were collected from the *many* servers we had.  I 
could just pick an interesting-sounding metric and then would just ask 
the system to show me the top 10 or bottom 10 out of a population of 
thousands or more.


To get my feet wet with the whole &quot;investigations&quot; thing that we&#x27;d do, I 
started looking into this one day and chose one of the many temp sensors 
which were being logged by the servers.  I forget exactly which one it 
was, for there were many.  The CPUs logged it, the chassis logged it, 
the power supply logged it, and so on.  There were so many choices.


I went looking for a reason.  What could possibly explain this?  First 
off, it didn&#x27;t line up with any obvious pattern in the host names.  The 
hosts were named for whichever team owned them, followed by a sequence 
number that was bumped any time a new one was provisioned.  There was no 
signal to be found in that.


There was more, though.  You could also see a &quot;rack position&quot; in this 
data, and now it started getting interesting.  It seems that all of the 
really hot machines had a rack position of something low, like 04 or 05, 
and never anything higher than that.  In fact, when looking at a whole 
rack, it was always the lowest number of all of the positions that were 
being used.  Now this was worth chasing!


It&#x27;s good that I asked, since they told me something surprising: 
position 04 or 05 or whatever was the *bottom* of the rack.  Yes, 
somehow, the lowest machine in the rack was the hottest!  They found 
this interesting, too, and wound up digging into it.  Given that I was 
far away in a distant office, this was the best way for us to proceed.


The problem was that the bottommost server would have nothing below it 
but just open space until it got to the floor.  That space would not 
move air efficiently, and it obviously mattered.


This rolled out and my hot spots disappeared.  Fantastic!</p>

                  <p>Another day, another bit of local flavor, but this time it&#x27;s something I 
wish I didn&#x27;t have to write about.

wrote
about seeing a maintenance truck rolling down the Caltrain line in 
Mountain View.  It had a special attachment to let it stay on the rails.  
At no point did the arms come down for the crossing.  It managed to 
approach, then the people inside looked around and went through, and the 
arms never budged.  There were no flashing lights or bells.




caught fire.  A bunch of people were hurt.  More were shaken 
up.


I&#x27;m assuming their construction trucks don&#x27;t trigger the &quot;short the 
rails together to signal various things&quot; logic, either.  This would 
mean that crossing arms stay up... and I have to assume it also means 
the signals along the way stay green instead of going red.

We will presumably hear more about whatever the signals said, and 
whether the train went past a red signal or not.  I just have a bad 
feeling that they saw a green and kept on going.</p>

                  <p>Here&#x27;s a little bit of Silicon Valley local flavor for a change.  We 
have this freeway that runs from San Jose to San Francisco called US 
101, or around here, just &quot;101&quot;.  (Southern California has it too, but 
they call it &quot;the&quot; 101.  That&#x27;s how we detect invaders.)  Anyway, this 
thing is usually eight or more lanes up and down the peninsula, and it&#x27;s 
had a &quot;diamond&quot; or car pool lane on the #1 (innermost/&quot;fast&quot;) lane for 
many years.  You had to have a certain number of people in the car (or 
some other conditions met) during certain hours (AM and PM rush, 
weekdays), or you&#x27;d be in for a hefty ticket.


How does the system know what to charge you?  Well, you either have an 
old-style toll transponder that always bills you as a solo driver, or 
you have a new-style transponder with a 1/2/3+ switch that tells the 
road how to handle you.


Think about what this does to enforcement.  Now, instead of just &quot;is 
there a vehicle in the lane&quot;, &quot;is it the right time during a weekday&quot;, 
and &quot;how many people are in the car&quot;, now it&#x27;s also a matter of &quot;do they 
have their transponder set properly&quot;.


Check this out.

could roll up on them and give them a ticket.</p>

story
about how you can hose your machine by pointing the Linux kernel at a 
custom core dump handler and then have that handler fail to function.  
This&#x27;ll clog up the pipe (really), and then everything else will just 
stack up behind it.  Pretty soon, every crashing process will be stuck 
just the same.


Once upon a time, in a big company environment, someone decided that 
they wanted to provide a service to other things running on the same 
Linux box.  But, instead of either writing Yet Another Service (tm) 
that would go through release processes and all of that good stuff, they 
went for a different design entirely.


There are so many problems with this.  You have the issue of a &quot;server&quot;

                  <p>If a web site makes an RSS or Atom feed available, it&#x27;s not a bad idea 
to poll it from time to time.  Actually doing that poll like a good 
netizen (remember that concept?) takes a little attention to detail.


Given the reality of the situation, does it make sense to poll every 10 
seconds?  Probably not, right?  Someone set up something like that and 
left it running for a couple of months until I finally noticed it and 
dealt with it myself.


Given this, you can keep track of the &quot;Last-Modified&quot; header when you 
get a copy of the feed.  Then, you can turn around and use that same 
value in an &quot;If-Modified-Since&quot; header the next time you come to look 
for an update.  If nothing&#x27;s changed, the web server will notice it&#x27;s 
the same as what it already has, and it&#x27;ll send you a HTTP 304 co…</p>

                  <p>Here&#x27;s a concept: &quot;ssh to prod and edit directly on the machine&quot; is 
generally bad news.


I should point out that I didn&#x27;t know this person and had no idea how 
they would respond to such feedback - it might have been fine!  They 
might be a well-adjusted person who can take a request like that and not 
turn it around into a full-on nuclear attack.  But, I didn&#x27;t know either 
way.


At some point, I actually had a meeting with this developer for some 
other reason, and what happened was kind of amazing.  First thing, he 
brought it up and asked me about it.  I said something like, &quot;well, I 
didn&#x27;t want to get into it, but since you asked&quot;, and proceeded into 
something along the lines of &quot;obviously it would be best if you didn&#x27;t 
do that - sshing in and twiddling Python files on the actual production 
AWS instance of the service&quot;.


&quot;But... I suspect you are doing it for some reason?&quot;


My response was... I hope... reasonable: &quot;So as much as I would love to 
say &#x27;don&#x27;t do that!!!&#x27;, I&#x27;m not going to stand in the way of you 
literally doing your job.  So please proceed with care, and keep an eye 
open for some day when (first dumb thing) and (second dumb thing) aren&#x27;t 
problems any more and you need not do this any more.&quot;


It was either &quot;edit in prod&quot; or endure DAY LONG development cycles: make 
a change, wait 24 hours, come back tomorrow, and try it again.  That&#x27;s 
how broken it was.


The best part about this was that we had a totally reasonable 
conversation about it.  It&#x27;s the kind of thing which had become a rare 
commodity in those days at that place.


Would I expect someone else to go to that level of insanity every single 
time they just want to get their job done?  Absolutely not.

Editing files in prod to develop them?  That&#x27;s bad news.  Deliberately 
rigging tunnels to spoof a connection from prod?  That&#x27;s also bad news.  
Having to do them to get your job done?  You might be in the bad place.</p>

someone has a problem with someone else or something that person is 
doing, they&#x27;re going to find a way to get to &quot;no&quot;.  They will find some 
reason, some excuse, or some problem with it.  They&#x27;ll bring up a point

again and again.


But, as I said, that was back then, and this time I&#x27;m talking about 
something else: when it happens in person with a coworker.  I had an 
experience like this a few years back, and figured I&#x27;d share how it goes 
for the sake of others who might not have encountered it yet, or who 
have and thought they were alone in this.

                  <p>This is a short one since it&#x27;s somewhere between a random bit of 
&quot;grab some popcorn&quot; amusement and a &quot;huh, that might be a problem some 
day&quot;.  In short, it looks like every Raspberry Pi filesystem installed 
from any given release image probably ends up with the same
UUID.


For instance, if you downloaded the &quot;lite&quot; version of Raspbian between 
roughly November 8th and January 28th, you probably got a file called 
2021-10-30-raspios-bullseye-armhf-lite.zip.  Inside, there&#x27;s an image, 
and the idea is that you dump that straight to your SD card, cram it in 
the Pi, and off you go.  The second partition on that image is an ext4 
filesystem which was created on some build machine somewhere.  The UUID 
on it never gets &quot;evolved&quot; to something else after the install.


You can see it inside the image itself here:


Or, if you actually installed a few of these things like I did over the 
past couple of months, you can just &#x27;tune2fs -l /dev/mmcblk0p2&#x27; and see 
the same value in there.


Don&#x27;t end up with a pile of SD cards on your desk and think &quot;I know, 
I&#x27;ll use the filesystem UUIDs to track which one goes where&quot;, in other 
words.


If it&#x27;s not breaking anything for you, it&#x27;s probably best to just let it 
be.  Untangling a boot mess on these weird little boxes is anything but 
fun.

Note: if you&#x27;re actually on a recent Raspberry Pi, odds are good that 
your /etc/fstab will be using *partition* UUIDs (PARTUUID&#x3D;...) and not 
those of the filesystem.  If in doubt, use blkid to see what&#x27;s what.</p>

This is actually a story about somewhere I used to work, and someone who

the people in a far-away office had created some kind of tool that would

                  <p>There are some interesting implications to the way that you have to 
handle references to other bits of code when you write a C++ header 
file.  There are things you can do which turn out to be suboptimal, and 
until or unless you work someplace with a coding style document or get 
some mentor who&#x27;s already been there, you&#x27;re likely to make some
mistakes.


Anyway, a common way to do this is to set up the outer class such that 
it has a pointer to the inner one.  You *could* have it just own it 
directly, but then that introduces problems.

  Bar bar_;



Of course, bar.h probably has its own dependencies which get #included, 
and so now you end up with this evil web of slow compiles.  It sucks.


What used to happen next is that someone would say, okay, let&#x27;s make it

                  <p>Yesterday, I
put forth
a bunch of API possibilities for the problem of needing to return a 
value but also indicating the lack of a value and being able to comment 
on why.  In it, the notion of a &quot;wrapper&quot; around a string was presented, 
such that it might look like &quot;Result&quot;, and those brackets 
started looking like a pain.  There was also the possibility of having 
something like &quot;ResultString&quot;, but didn&#x27;t that open the door to having a 
bunch of code duplication?


After this had existed for a while, the general happy feeling of having 
this stuff in place became infectious.  I wanted it to cover other 
things with it, too.  I wanted it to handle something a bit more 
complicated than a mere string, and so decided to try my hand at the 
template-wrangling metaprogramming cruft t…</p>

                  <p>If you agree with the notion that you need to be able to tell the 
difference between the absence of a value and a value itself, then this 
has some impacts on the code you write.  If you want to keep &#x27;em 
separated (so they can come out and play), then it gets you looking at 
your API designs in certain ways.


Imagine we&#x27;re talking about a helper function that is intended to be run 
inside a program that&#x27;s handling the access to a web page.  It&#x27;s 
probably a CGI program, but it could also be buried inside some much 
bigger thing, too.  This is all about C++ styles, but you can probably 
see slices of other languages in here, too.

I mentioned taking my old Mac Mini out of the OS X/macos ecosystem and 
bringing it into Debian, and then what kind of hilarity followed when I 
attempted to install a Javascript linter (and it tried to drag in 180+ 
node-related packages).

here.

My relative inexperience with Debian systems means I&#x27;m constantly being 
delighted to discover that such and such has already been packaged up

accomplish nothing.

&quot;process infection&quot; story:

https://lwn.net/Articles/883547/):


If you do privileged execution of specific operations via IPC you get 
the guarantee that whatever is done, is done from a well-defined, 
pristine execution environment, without leaking context implicitly. The 
IPC message is the *full* vulnerable surface, and that&#x27;s as minimal as 
it can get. And that&#x27;s great.




Oh wow, thank you for mentioning that, unnamed reader!  I definitely 
read that post on LWN at some point in the past couple of days when the 
pkexec thing started going around.  It must have really worked its way 
into my head, and then eventually stirred up the memory of everything 
getting &quot;nicely infected&quot; at $OLD_JOB.

from the way they managed machines and some of the fun side-effects 
processes can have on each other.  This is back in the pre-systemd days 
of running services, such that things tended to be started or restarted 
by someone or something that itself ran as root.  That is, if you 
started something, it might inherit one or more things from your 
environment.  Likewise, if you ran something with an unusual 
environment, it might bestow those &quot;gifts&quot; onto anything it happened to 
touch.

generally learned that after you mess with a glibc upgrade, you restart

                  <p>Nearly 30 years ago, I was given this picture.  I wanted to present it 
in a post all by itself to give it a chance to &quot;sink in&quot; before I went 
and used it in an analogy.  First, I&#x27;ll just show the image and explain 
what you&#x27;re looking at here.




I do remember the description from the back: this is a picture of *part 
of* something that was called the Software Creations BBS.  It was a 
multi-line bulletin board system where you could dial up and send 
messages to people, upload and download files, and (presumably) play 
online games (&quot;doors&quot;) and anything else they cared to offer.

64 machines in a little space.  I have to assume 
they are at least 
286s (ATs, more or 
less), but it&#x27;s impossible to tell from just this picture.  They could 
have been 386s or even 486s by that point, but …</p>

                  <p>Okay, so yesterday I 
posted
a picture of an old multi-line bulletin board system which had 
apparently taken over an entire bedroom with dozens of computers.  I 
mentioned that I intended to come back to the topic to throw in my own 
two cents, and so here we go.


Or, were you someone who found it horrific and wished there was a 
simpler way?  Did you wonder if it would be possible to pack all of that 
into one or maybe two boxes, instead?  Did you want a way to negate all 
of that complexity while still providing the same level of service?


Now, things are different.  I look at that and just sigh at the lost 
opportunities.  The actual amount of work being done on behalf of any of 
the users who are connected is tiny.  If we ignore the fact that the 
actual BBS software and related acc…</p>
