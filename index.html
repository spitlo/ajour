                  <p>Instagram I come across Harry Clarke’s stringy, spooky illustrations for the 1919 Edgar Allan Poe collection Tales of Mystery &amp; Imagination (above left) or the 1925 version of Goethe’s Faust. Poking around led me to this 2016 story in the Public Domain Review: “Harry Clarke’s Looking Glass.” As I learned, he once wrote to a friend that his publisher thought a set of his Faust illustrations were “full of stench and steaming horrors.”
50watts has more great images, and here’s a zoomable version of the “Sea Witch” (above right) from his illustrations for Hans Christian Andersen’s “The Little Mermaid.”

Since 2002, Google don’t allow “gimmicky use of words, numbers, letters, punctuation, or symbols” on AdWords. Which seems to mean text graphics, emoticons and kaomojis. But some slip through for a while anyway. Supposedly. 
SiXT made it in 2007. In 2008 there was Payday, We Are Collective, Metapeople and Logic Immo. In 2009, Worms and MotoFriends. And in 2011 a rabbit snuck through in Ukraine.</p>

                  <p>Last night my family listened to “The Wexford Carol” after my husband asked if I knew about its backstory. I didn’t, but I learned that while the song is centuries old, it was only relatively recently transcribed. 
There’s an affecting version of that story in a recent post on America: The Jesuit Review, by Maggi Van Dorn. “I have learned to take Christmas carols seriously,” she writes, “and to anticipate the epiphanies they may bear in my spiritual life as I contemplate them anew. […] As for ‘The Wexford Carol,’ it quietly survived over 400 years of British colonial suppression and was first put to paper in the small Irish village of Enniscorthy,” where she traveled to ask locals about the song. 
The above Alison Krauss and Yo-Yo Ma rendition appears on Ma’s 2008 holiday album, Songs of Joy &amp; Peace. Loreena McKennitt also has a beautiful version, as does the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, which made a cheesy music video that also made me cry.

                  <p>“I know some women who have decided to forgo motherhood altogether — not out of an empowered certainty that they want to remain child-free, but because the alternative seems impossibly daunting. Others are still choosing motherhood, but with profound apprehension that it will require them to sacrifice everything that brings them pleasure.” In Vox, Rachel M. Cohen writes about “How Millennials Learned to Dread Motherhood.”
As an old millennial, I feel compelled to say that being a mom is awesome and easily one of the most interesting and meaningful things that’s ever happened to me. But talking about how great it is can feel like tempting the gods. As Cohen notes in her piece, “When I started asking women about their experiences as mothers, I was startled by the number who sheepishly admitted, and only after being pressed, that they had pretty equitable arrangements with their partners, and even loved being moms, but were unlikely to say any of that publicly.”

                  <p>Yesterday at our library’s Story Time, the reader chose a book that knocked my socks off: Little Witch Hazel: A Year in the Woods, by Phoebe Wahl, from 2021. (Trailer above.) It’s about a tiny witch who lives in the forest, and it follows her on her adventures through the seasons. (The book is divided into four sections.) The kids in the crowd — ages two through five — were mostly entranced. 

Two of the book’s most beautiful pages are available as prints; my favorite is above.  
Wahl’s website also led me to an illustrated editorial she did for the NYT last year: “The Joys of Swimming While Fat.”

                  <p>This is a recommendation for the pattern to the delightful Pengweeno children’s cardigan, by Stephen West. I’ve made three of them — this post is probably/definitely just an excuse to share these photos — and hope to make more. 

It’s a good way to use up spare yarn, and the result is supremely cute and satisfying. There’s also an adult version — the Penguono — but for whatever reason only the Pengweeno speaks to me. (Here’s Stephen West on Ravelry, Instagram, and his website.)

                  <p>When I was collecting links to share in advance of this guest-blogging stint, Moe Tkacik’s Slate essay on Jezebel was at the top of my list. Then I saw it shared everywhere and figured it would be old news by the time I started posting. But in case anyone’s missed it, it brought me back immediately to how I felt reading Jezebel at my desk at my first office job. Namely: thrilled/in awe someone like her existed.
Mini anecdote: In 2008 I emailed Moe an idea for a Jezebel story. She wrote back saying, and I believe I quote, because I remember where I was when I got her response as well as the device I was reading it on: “I like this idea.” It never went anywhere, but the idea that she liked an idea of mine changed my life. Thanks, Moe.

                  <p>I’m not a Buddhist or a meditator, but I’ve subscribed to Buddhist magazine Tricycle for the past few years. They send a “Daily Dharma” newsletter each morning, with a single line from an archived story. I love these and maybe someday I’ll actually start meditating. Here’s one from last month:

But a story from a 2022 issue has especially stuck with me: psychiatrist (and Buddhist) Mark Epstein’s personal essay on having a speech impediment and “How Meditation Failed Me.” 
… I was instructed to read the book as perfectly as I could, without rustling or coughing, speeding up or slowing down, or messing up in any way. I had done this once before with a previous book, and I was proud of having accomplished it smoothly. …
On this occasion, however, my old speech impediment came back to haunt me. Going to Pieces begins with the word “In” — a strange sound, when one isolates it and stops to think about it and convinces oneself that it cannot be said.


Each time I’ve read this essay, the ending overwhelms me. “It seemed important, at first, to find someone or something to blame…”
My only criticism of the magazine is that I wish there were more visuals to use other than Buddhas.

                  <p>Cool “old” songs, part two? This 2021 jam was used as background music in a TikTok or Instagram reel I came across last year, and it stopped me in my tracks. I looked it up immediately and don’t understand why it hasn’t become a worldwide hit: “Mind My Business,” by Trinidadian singer Patrice Roberts. I think about it all the time. There’s also a funny music video, but I kind of prefer just imagining. [Patrice Roberts on wikipedia/instagram]

                  <p>asked for suggestions on where I might find bright, fruit-themed running clothes for adults (FTRCfA), and I was not disappointed. Commenter Seth wrote: 
As a runner myself I always found BOA Running shorts and Chicknleg running shorts to have fun patterns. Last I checked both had at least a strawberry pattern to meet your fruit needs.

strawberry women’s shorts at BOA were even on sale. They also have cute peach ones, for both men and women. At Chicknleg I went for the pineapples and sea turtles. The snails were also tempting. Thank you, and I’m looking forward to wearing these silly, cheerful clothes come summer. I only started running at the beginning of the pandemic, but it has transformed my life. I didn’t think it would change my relationship with clothing, but it’s so much easier to wear goofy, neon stuff this way, and to not feel ridiculous about it — or to enjoy feeling ridiculous.

                  <p>This is old news, but New Yorker cartoonist Roz Chast also makes embroidered tapestries (and occasional embroidered New Yorker covers), and they’re just stunning. I also liked an interview she gave earlier this year with the sewing magazine Threads:
[Threads]: What is your favorite textile piece?
RC: It’s a picture of a little girl and she’s holding a little notebook and she has a pen and she has her parents on either side of her and the border is a quote from a Polish poet, Czesław Miłosz, and the quote is, “When a writer is born into a family, the family is finished.”

An exhibition of Chast’s embroidery — “Buildings, Bananas, and Beyond” — recently closed at the Carol Corey Fine Art gallery in Kent, CT, but there are some fantastic images online (three are featured at the top of this post, but the thumbnails don’t do them justice).
I think my favorite is her “Diver” (below).

                  <p>Lots of Kottke readers probably know about the band Pere Ubu, but I only learned about them a couple years ago, through my husband. Their song “Breath” totally rules, as does their legendary 1989 performance of it (above) on the live-music show “Sunday Night,” hosted by David Sanborn (and Jools Holland — although now I’m just quoting from Wikipedia). May I someday tap into whatever he’s tapping into if I haven’t already. 
If you want more, I highly recommend the musician Cat Popper’s 2021 cover of “Breath.” (“I really like that version of ‘Breath,’” said Pere Ubu’s own David Thomas. “I like it better than mine.”)
“Breath” comes from the album Cloudland, which also contains the excellent song “Waiting for Mary,” which Pere Ubu performed on that same “Sunday Night” show. And here’s the studio version of “Breath” [spotify link] if you want a cleaner listen.

                  <p>The “Sunday Long Read” newsletter linked to two parenting-adjacent stories yesterday, on opposite ends of the spectrum. One scared the crap out of me: an account of nearly dying shortly after a c-section, by Grace Glassman in Slate (“I gave birth at 45. It was a miracle that almost cost me everything”). The other was funny: David Sedaris on modern kids, in The Free Press (“Children now are like animals who have no natural predators left”).

                  <p>Reading NYT book critic Dwight Garner’s memories of the books that he read/reviewed this past year (“I … remember making a fool of myself”) reminded me how much I also enjoyed his Grub Street Diet from a couple months ago. Without rereading it, and following the Sigrid Nunez prompt he used in the NYT book-memories article: I remember from that post that his apartment seemed creaky and comfortable, and that it seemed like he had a nice marriage. Also maybe something about oysters. […] Okay, no oysters, yes organ meat.

                  <p>Hello! The other day, I started wondering – has anyone ever made a FUSE
filesystem for a git repository where all every commit is a folder? It turns
out the answer is yes! There’s giblefs,
GitMounter, and git9 for Plan 9.
But FUSE is pretty annoying to use on Mac – you need to install a kernel
extension, and Mac OS seems to be making it harder and harder to install kernel
extensions for security reasons. Also I had a few ideas for how to organize the
filesystem differently than those projects.
So I thought it would be fun to experiment with ways to mount filesystems on
Mac OS other than FUSE, so I built a project that does that called
git-commit-folders. It works (at least on my computer) with both FUSE and NFS, and there’s a broken WebDav
implementation too.
It’s pretty experimental (I’m …</p>

                  <p>One problem with having a toddler is that there’s so much you can buy them, and it’s so easy to be tempted by all of it. Or to resist 98% of the time, but then cave and still end up having spent hundreds of dollars on sweaters and toothbrushes and sunglasses and shoes. And trampolines and socks and stuffed dragons. It’s just that my daughter likes everything right now, and it makes me feel good to give her something that she likes. Really it’s just the clothes that torment me. She loves new clothes and will put on anything that’s new to her, including all the fabulous hand-me-downs we get. But Mother magazine sometimes hits that 2% sweet (rotten) spot. A couple weeks ago, it got me to buy a little apple sweater, which I love, but which I regret buying in her size (2T) and not in a size that she’d grow into (3T), because it’s basically already too small, which is absurd because it cost $50 (on sale plus shipping and tax). I also put like $200 worth of clothing (on sale!) from Petit Pilou into a digital shopping cart before abruptly closing the tab and shutting off my phone. But I bet if I open it up again it will still be there. The pineapple dresses were really what got me. 
Maybe I just want to dress all in fruit myself, and it pleases me to live through my daughter, since she seems to enjoy it as well. Hanna Andersson has some wonderful fruit clothing, since I’m on the topic. We have their strawberry socks, swimsuit, and hat. 
If anyone knows of any running clothes with cool fruit patterns, please let me know. I’ve been hoping Janji will bust out with something good (their other patterns are often excellent), and although it would be cool if Tracksmith did something fruity, it would probably be tasteful and realistic, when I’m looking for something neon and extreme. Something cheerful. I hope Santa is listening.

                  <p>This 30-minute NYT documentary about an Irish family sheep farm was blissful and entrancing, until they started sawing (or, trimming) a ram’s horns. It was still good, it was just a different experience. I would also describe it overall as “strange.” (“Ramboy.”) [thx, Andrew!]

                  <p>I don’t have a green thumb, but I bought one of these a few months ago, and it’s still going strong. This post is purely to recommend that plant: pilea peperomioides, also known as the Chinese money plant, the coin plant, the friendship plant, and the UFO plant. It’s pleasingly goofy and, as far as I can tell, resilient. I’ve even snipped off a few of the little “babies” that sprout from its sides (above right), kept them in water for a couple weeks to let them grow roots…

… and replanted them to give to friends. 

It’s a satisfying endeavor. I will share this now before any of the little guys die.  
It’s nothing like Jason’s fiddle leaf fig, but you never know. 
Actually rereading that post is very moving. Writing this blog for even a few days has been an affecting experience. It has me remembering past lives and investigating current ones.

                  <p>“Why’d I Take Speed for 20 Years?” … asks former Reply All host PJ Vogt, in his new podcast Search Engine. “Dexedrine was like glasses, [the doctor said], but for my brain.” The episode looks at the history and rise of medical amphetamines, and I found it riveting. (Full disclosure: PJ is a friend of mine.) The podcast also has a newsletter, which I read more than I listen to the show. I’m not really a podcast person, although I also especially liked an earlier episode speculating about “what’s going on with Elon Musk?”

                  <p>“She has set her ego aside in exchange for something bigger and better.” This is maybe a little out there, but a couple years ago I bought a session with a hypnotherapist (or, a subconscious success coach). I wanted to make money through my newsletter but felt weird about it and wondered if something psychological might be getting in the way. I don’t know if there was or not, and I am not here to recommend hypnotherapy. However I have remained on the hypnotherapist’s email newsletter, and the above was a single line from one of her recent “Two-Minute Transformation” emails. I might have just been in the right zone to receive it, and/or it might need more context, but it helped me see that much of what I fear is simply having my ego dented, which made it easier to imagine a path forward. Her name is Gaby Abrams.

                  <p>Hey everyone!
This is the list of all the changes we&#x27;ve done to our projects during the month of November.
Summary Of Changes
Wiktopher, drew some new art(Mastodon), finalized a few translations(Mastodon), and released it the project on Itchio!
Thousand Rooms, translated the book(Mastodon) into Solresol.
100r.co, added a still map of our Pacific circumnavigation in where, added repair, effect of combining dissimilar metals, bikes on a boat, upholstery and updated lifelines.
Busy Doing Nothing, added GPS coordinates(Mastodon) for every listed day of travel.
Hakum, designed handwritten font for the comic and wrote a post about the process.
Elmet Brae, released a collaborative album with members of the Merveilles community and friends. Made the album cover in collaboration with Rostiger, who also
made the Varvara Zine.
Solrela, released a Solresol translator website to replace the now defunct Sidosi translator.
News
Wiktopher is finally finished. We started this book in 2017 while in French Polynesia, constrained by power limitations and hardware failures. Writing demanded less energy than drawing digitally, Rek could use the Chromebook to work (see tools ecosystem). You can read the first two chapters of the finished story here[4.1 MiB] as a PDF. If you liked what you&#x27;ve read, we hope you&#x27;ll consider reading the rest!
We treated ourselves this month to new saloon cushions(see upholstery). We sleep and live on these, it&#x27;s so nice to have plump cushions again!
IMPORTANT. You may have heard but the service we use to send our newsletter(TinyLetter) is shutting down early next year (Feb 2024). We are in the process of setting up an alternative, we&#x27;ll provide details on that in December&#x27;s  newsletter and on this website.
Pino book &amp; movie club
We are reading Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s The Crying of Lot 49, and enjoyed watching Close Encounters of the Third Kind.

Bike generator in Paris, France
A year after Low-tech Magazine built and documented a domestic bicycle generator, the Pavillon d’Arsenal in Paris asked if they could borrow it for an exhibition. We agreed to build a new one instead. The result of our work is now part of the exhibition “Énergies légères”, which runs until March 2024. The installation gives visitors an idea of how much energy they can produce as humans.

Bike generator in Rotterdam, Netherlands
In October, we built a third energy bicycle during a workshop at the House of the Future in Rotterdam. This bicycle generator is now used as an energy source in the community center. The House of the Future is open to the public, for details see their website and instagram.
In a future article, we will cover the construction process and technical details of these two new muscular power plants. These machines are based on spinning bikes and are more powerful than the first bike generator we built.

Bike generator in Barcelona, Spain
The first energy bike we made in 2022 is currently on display at AkashaHub in Barcelona. For details see their website and instagram.

Bike generator in the US
Finally, Andy Lagzdins built a pedal-powered air compressor to run the power tools in his motorcycle workshop, a project that he documented on Low-tech Magazine. We have now put a video online showing how the machine works.

asked: 
Really interested in knowing more about your writing/journaling/drawing process and practice!


And because I love being asked questions, I thought I would respond in a post!
Basically first thing each morning I drink coffee and draw for an hour or so. I usually draw whatever seems memorable from the day before. This is like three days worth of the journal comics: 

The habit started about seven years ago when I stopped drinking and found I had a lot of energy in the morning, and that I really enjoyed doing something manual while I drank a ton of coffee. So I began keeping a traditional journal, and then I started a second journal for sketching (f…</p>

                  <p>Not long ago, when I ordered a café au lait in downtown Washington, I was told my lait choices were oat, soy, or almond. “I’ll take regular whole milk,” I said. “Sorry, we don’t have that,” the barista replied. 

My mind was blown in this entertaining Natalie Angier review of a new book on milk. (“Spoiled: The Myth of Milk as Superfood,” by Anne Mendelson.)

                  <p>When Jason asked me to guest-blog for him, one of my first thoughts was, Omg I get to do a MEDIA DIET!!! However my recent book/TV consumption has mostly been straight P.D. James novels (fantastic, A+), with sides of C.J. Sansom and Sesame Street.
But I do have a mini-diet of media-diet features:
Embedded’s “My Internet” Q&amp;As, where “very online” people share what they’ve been reading/watching/doing online. A recent favorite is Amanda Hess’s.
NYT’s “By the Book” (and its wonderful portraits). However: Do people really keep such a particular and revealing stack of books on their nightstands? Or is “nightstand” a figure of speech?
The Monday Media Diets featured in the Why Is This Interesting newsletter, even if they frequently enrage me (not this one, though!).


I also read a lot of newsletters, and after years of subscribing and unsubscribing, I can wholeheartedly recommend the following, most of which will probably not be new to Kottke readers, but just in case:
Parenting
ParentData, by Emily Oster
Evil Witches, by Claire Zulkey
Culture &amp; Criticism
Today in Tabs, by Rusty Foster 
The Ruffian, by Ian Leslie 
The Browser, by Robert Cottrell and Caroline Crampton
Christian Lorentzen’s Diary, by Christian Lorentzen

                  <p>I’m enjoying sharing some of these more-recent comics on this site. This one basically picks up after yesterday’s left off. Maybe I will try to keep up a string of them until it’s time for me to go.

                  <p>How to Clean Mold From Bath Toys. In case anyone is in a similar boat, I tried the “put toys in the dishwasher” suggestion, but it didn’t work as well as I’d hoped (but it was pretty good), so I tried the “soak toys for hours in a tub with vinegar and water” suggestion. Also not an obvious success, but maybe I didn’t have enough vinegar. Or maybe I just let the toys get too moldy.

                  <p>I came across Alex Tomlinson’s work on Instagram one day in 2022 (it was featured on Audubon Society merch, which I bought immediately), and have been enjoying it ever since. I’m having one of his “Red-Eyed Birds of North America” posters framed as a gift for myself this Christmas! He also sells tons of cards, stickers, and apparel on his website.

                  <p>I’m a megafan of the newsletter The Culture We Deserve, by Jessa Crispin (formerly of Bookslut). I spent most of an entire therapy session discussing a line and a half from an installment a few weeks back: “…online creators need to start developing a healthy amount of contempt for their audiences. Because your audience has contempt for you!” Pairs well with Becca Rothfeld’s essay on condescension in the Yale Review. (“Why do public intellectuals condescend to their readers?”)

                  <p>“Anti-aging is a disappointing pursuit. … There is no point at which the anti-aging will have worked – when you look in the mirror and say, ‘I’ve done it! I’m anti-aged!’ Once you buy into the concept of anti-aging, you buy in forevermore.” That’s from the first installment of Ask Ugly, an advice column by Jessica DeFino, in The Guardian’s new Wellness section. (And in response to the question “Should I get Botox?”) DeFino’s beauty newsletter, The Unpublishable, is also great.

                  <p>“I woke up one morning and realized that all I wanted to do was drink.” That’s from the “Ask a Sober Oldster” Q&amp;A series, which is a collaboration between the newsletters Oldster Magazine, by Sari Botton, and The Small Bow, by A.J. Daulerio. (I’m biased because I do the illustrations, but I truly enjoy the interviews.) There have been six installments so far, and I think my favorite is No. 4. Or maybe No. 5. Also No. 2. Really all of them.

                  <p>Fox &amp; Geese &amp; Fences: A Collection of Traditional Maine Mittens, by Robin Hansen, and make her a pair. I did, it was a wonderful experience, and I have been knitting mittens from the book ever since (some pictured above). They are exceptionally warm and durable. A bonus is that the patterns are written with a kind of common sense that for me at least made a few steps feel like fun puzzles. (What does she mean by “K both colors, gray then red, into the st that should have been gray”?? … ohhHHhhh!!!) 
I found the book used on Amazon, but other books of Hansen’s are available on her website. My favorite pattern to make is “Sawtooth” (various above and below), but the best are maybe the “Safe Home” ones (center left), found elsewhere online. [thx Cecilia!] Oh also: Pair with Maine’s Bartlett Yarns – perfection.
Okay one more shot, these are my everyday mittens, I think I’ve been wearing these for the past five winters (Sawtooth pattern). Glorious!

                  <p>Dolly Parton on “Jolene”: “…to have someone love a man so much that she would, rather than giving him up and being mad about him having an affair, but loving him enough to understand how he would fall in love with someone else because they’re that beautiful. … People thought it was a very honest, open, and humble kind of song about the subject.” I’ve always wondered about that aspect of the lyrics. Maybe that’s something to aspire to, but I don’t really get it. Obviously I love the song.  [vulture]

                  <p>Hello, I’m Edith! I love this site, and I’m excited to be here. (Thanks, Jason!) I haven’t blogged like this for more than a decade, so I hope I’m not too rusty. Please feel free to email me any tips; I would be delighted to get them. 
As Jason mentioned, since 2019 I’ve been sending a comics newsletter called Drawing Links, although it’s been on hiatus since last fall. However, I’m going to try running some old comics here – see below – in the hopes of working up momentum to bring my newsletter back. We’ll see how it goes! 
More about me?? I’m originally from Cambridge, MA, and although I lived for 16 years in Brooklyn, a couple years ago my husband and I moved to a small town in upstate New York, not too far from Albany. We are now expecting our second daughter, due in a few weeks. 
Thanks for reading! 
…Okay, I was hoping to hide these comics behind a “read more” page-break button, but it seems Jason’s interface doesn’t have that option, so I guess I’ll be really taking over the main page. 
And so, to kick this off, here is a little story about the first time I saw a bear (from 2022):

This is the &quot;sponsored listing&quot; ad, which allows merchants to bid to be among the top-ranked items in response to your searches – whether or not their products are a good match for your query.

This is an ancient Heath-19 terminal “graphics” demo. It looks a bit rough in Lucida Console, but that’s only because it does not contain the Heath-19 special graphics characters, which were not added to Unicode until Unicode 3.1, and will take some time to find their way into Unicode fonts such as Lucida Console and Courier New.</p>

Edith was the founding editor of The Hairpin (RIP), wrote a profile of Chris Evans that broke the internet a little bit, and most recently was Drawing Links (on hiatus). You can buy greeting cards featuring her drawings on Etsy. She starts tomorrow — I’m very excited to see what she’s going to do with the site. Welcome, Edith!
Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m off to complete an item from my bucket list: going on a walk with Craig Mod and Kevin Kelly. I will see you back here in mid-December. 👋

                  <p>Itttt’s baaack… After not happening for the past three years, the Kottke Holiday Gift Guide has returned. I’ve scoured the internet and dozens of other gift guides for the best (and sometimes weirdest) stuff out there — it’s a curated meta-guide for your holiday giving. This list is US-centric, link-heavy, and you might see some tried-and-true items that have been featured in previous years. Ok, let’s get to it.
Charitable Giving
First thing’s first: charitable giving should be top-of-mind every holiday season if you can afford it. Giving locally is key. I support our area food shelf year-round, with an extra gift for Thanksgiving and the December holiday; giving money instead of food is best. The kids and I also support Toys for Tots by heading to the local toy store to get some things — …</p>

Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 quest to safe Arabella on the druid&#x27;s grove is a turning point for me. (1) You have options on how to act and what to do after you acted, (2) these choices impact the game and future choices, both in the near future and far future; and (3) when playing for the first time I didn&#x27;t feel like I had a choice, there was only thing my character would have done.

                  <p>Hello! I’ve been working on writing a zine about git so I’ve been thinking
about git branches a lot. I keep hearing from people that they find the way git
branches work to be counterintuitive. It got me thinking:  what might an
“intuitive” notion of a branch be, and how is it different from how git
actually works?
So in this post I want to briefly talk about
an intuitive mental model I think many people have
how git actually represents branches internally (“branches are a pointer to a commit” etc)
how the “intuitive model” and the real way it works are actually pretty closely related
some limits of the intuitive model and why it might cause problems
Nothing in this post is remotely groundbreaking so I’m going to try to keep it pretty short.

It’s an unofficial upload so who knows how long it will last. The three song mix by Judge Jules at the beginning of the first disc is still one of my all-time favorite mixes — I’m dancing in my chair to it right now.

                  <p>The Ministry of Sound did a show back in September at the Royal Albert Hall where they re-imagined classic 90s dance music (Fatboy Slim, Chemical Brothers, etc.) backed by a 50-piece orchestra and vocalists. I found out about this via organist Anna Lapwood’s Instagram, where she posted a clip of her participation in the show: playing Bach’s Toccata and Fugue in D minor as a lead-in to Insomnia by Faithless. I enjoyed the captions but the sound on her video is not great; I found this video on YouTube with much better sound (relevant part starts at the 4:15 mark):

I would love to have seen this live…I’d have lost my mind at this part. Sometimes I think I love remixes, mashups, and covers more than the original versions.

Last year, it was estimated that adults bought an average of nine presents and spent about $1500 on holiday gifts. Buying gifts doesn’t […]

                  <p>This entire article is a delight from start to finish, full of laugh-out-loud moments. I couldn’t decide which part to quote for you, so here are more than a few particularly delightful paragraphs.
The flight to Rome is sentient; it knows exactly where I’m going and what to provide. At my gate, I find myself sitting next to a guy eating a massive perfect panini. He smells like ten men, perhaps because of the additional paninis he is smuggling on his person. On the phone to his mother, he utters the immortal words: ‘And my sanweeches’.



Hope and I have, we have calculated, exactly 72 hours to be tourists. But the elements are against us — it’s 35°C, it’ll be 38°C tomorrow, and I forgot to bring deodorant to meet the pope. So we head to the farmacia, first things first, and buy me an Itali…</p>

                  <p>I linked to this in the recent David Bowie post, but it’s worth pulling out separately: the 100 greatest BBC musical performances. This is an incredible trove of late 20th and early 21st century musical greatness. Some selections just off the top of my head:
Blondie – Atomic/Heart of Glass (The Old Grey Whistle Test, 1979):

Talking Heads – Psycho Killer (OGWT, 1978):

Daft Punk – Essential Mix (Radio 1, 1997):

Hole – Doll Parts/He Hit Me (And It Felt Like A Kiss)/Violet (Later, 1995):

Joy Division – Transmission (Something Else, 1979):

Radiohead - Paranoid Android (Later Archive 1997):

The Jimi Hendrix Experience – Sunshine of Your Love (Happening for Lulu, 1969):

Patti Smith Group – Because the Night (OGWT, 1978):

Arlo Parks and Phoebe Bridgers – Fake Plastic Trees (Radio 1 Piano session, 2020):

Bob Dylan – live at BBC studios (BBC One, 1965), apparently Dylan’s last acoustic concert:

Dizzy Gillespie – Chega de Saudade (Jazz 625, 1965). Don’t miss the musician intro at the ~13:15 mark: 

Nirvana – Smells Like Teen Spirit (TOTP, 1991):

And Rihanna (Umbrella, 2008) and Prince (1993) and Lorde (Royals, 2013) and and and… If you’re anything like me, this list will keep you busy for a few hours.

                  <p>Climate scientist Kate Marvel is done warning people about the problems with our climate and has moved on to highlighting our success in combatting it.
The reason is that now, we have a better story to tell. The evidence is clear: Responding to climate change will not only create a better world for our children and grandchildren, but it will also make the world better for us right now.
Eliminating the sources of greenhouse gas emissions will make our air and water cleaner, our economy stronger and our quality of life better. It could save hundreds of thousands or even millions of lives across the country through air quality benefits alone. Using land more wisely can both limit climate change and protect biodiversity. Climate change most strongly affects communities that get a raw deal in o…</p>

                  <p>Apparently, Aardman Animation is running out of clay. The company that produces the clay ceased operations and they only have enough for one more feature film. Uhhh, why doesn’t Aardman just buy the clay company? Lucasfilm had ILM after all.

                  <p>I love these depictions of famous moments in psychology and cognitive science via @tomerullman. From top to bottom: the Stanford prison experiment, the marshmallow test, and the selective attention test.
These didn’t track as AI-generated at first…and then I tried to read the text — THE STANFORD PRESERIBENT. You can see the whole set on Bluesky (if you have access).

                  <p>CSS Grid is an incredibly powerful tool for building layouts on the web, but like all powerful tools, there&#x27;s a significant learning curve. In this tutorial, we&#x27;ll build a mental model for how CSS Grid works and how we can use it effectively. I&#x27;ll share the biggest 💡 lightbulb moments I&#x27;ve had in my own learning journey.</p>

                  <p>I only use Goodreads because it&#x27;s directly integrated into my Kindle (which I love) so I can easily track when I start and finish a book.
However, Goodreads itself is terrible for data, either losing the data, corrupting it or just not having it.
So I&#x27;ve fixed that.</p>

                  <p>This is the cover to the just-released United Nations Environment Programme Emissions Gap Report 2023 (full report here). Perfect title, perfect graphic, perfect subheadline. No notes.

Amazing that an official UN climate report has this much biting personality. You can just sense the no-fucks-givenness of the people who put this together. After all:
Humanity is breaking all the wrong records when it comes to climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions reached a new high in 2022. In September 2023, global average temperatures were 1.8°C above pre-industrial levels. When this year is over, according to the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service, it is almost certain to be the warmest year on record.
The 2023 edition of the Emissions Gap Report tells us that the world must change track, or we will be saying the same thing next year — and the year after, and the year after, like a broken record. The report finds that fully implementing and continuing mitigation efforts of unconditional nationally determined contributions (NDCs) made under the Paris Agreement for 2030 would put the world on course for limiting temperature rise to 2.9°C this century. Fully implementing conditional NDCs would lower this to 2.5°C. Given the intense climate impacts we are already seeing, neither outcome is desirable.


The report credits Beverley McDonald with the cover design — her website is here.

Lizzo on the flute), I Hate Myself For Loving You (feat. Joan Jett and The Blackhearts), and Every Breath You Take (feat. Sting). She also recorded a lovely rendition of Prince’s Purple Rain, embedded above. The entire Rockstar video playlist is here.

                  <p>In what’s been voted the greatest BBC musical performance of all time, David Bowie appeared on Top of the Pops in 1972 to sing Starman and changed the course of musical history.
The performance launched Bowie to stardom. Thursday 6th July, 1972, is said to be ‘the day that invented the 80’s’ as so many musicians who went on to be household names saw the performance and it changed their lives. Those watching that night included U2’s Bono, The Cure’s Robert Smith, Boy George, Adam Ant, Mick Jones of the Clash, Gary Kemp of Spandau Ballet, Morrissey and Johnny Marr of the Smiths, Siouxsie Sioux, Toyah Willcox, John Taylor and Nick Rhodes of Duran Duran, Dave Gahan of Depeche Mode and many more. 


Here’s more from Colin Marshall at Open Culture, who does a great job contextualizing the performance:
“It’s deceptively easy to forget that in the summer of 1972 David Bowie was still yesterday’s news to the average Top of the Pops viewer, a one-hit wonder who’d had a novelty single about an astronaut at the end of the previous decade,” writes Nicholas Pegg in The Complete David Bowie. But his taking the stage of that BBC pop-musical institution “in a rainbow jumpsuit and shocking red hair put paid to that forever. Having made no commercial impact in the two months since its release, ‘Starman’ stormed up the chart.” As with “Space Oddity,” “the subtext is all: this is less a science-fiction story than a self-aggrandizing announcement that there’s a new star in town.”

                  <p>Wow, what a lovely, inspiring story this is: in 2022, Gary McKee ran a marathon every single day. On weekdays, he got up early and completed his run before work. And along the way, he inspired a bunch of people to join him (one work colleague ran 92 marathons w/ him) and raised £1 million for Macmillan Cancer Support.

                  <p>Meanwhile, 100s of OpenAI employees are threatening to quit and join Altman at Microsoft unless the remaining board members resign. Turns out, if you sell AI-idealistic people on bettering the world, they don’t want to wait to do so (and get rich in the bargain).

This is my tenth such linkdump – here are the previous installments: https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/05/variegated/#nein While nostalgia is a toxic impulse (h/t John Hodgman), there&#x27;s no denying that there once existed an old, good web, and that it has given way to the enshitternet. I don&#x27;t want to bring the old, good web back, but …</p>

                  <p>Surprisingly modern for a book written nearly 100 years ago. A solid murder mystery.
Apparently one of Christie&#x27;s most (or more?) controversial books which I can believe given it was written in 1926. There&#x27;s talk of drugs and cocaine and even a dictaphone (which I didn&#x27;t even know had been invented back then).
I did somehow guess the murderer, but I suspect it&#x27;s because so many stories have come since, and it was a technique that has been employed many times since.
Still, enjoyable, and holds up well even in 2023.</p>

                  <p>This video from MoMA follows master printer Jacob Samuel as he makes his final print before he retires.
As he inks, hand wipes, and rolls his final print through the press, he reflects on his philosophy. “My goal is to leave no fingerprints,” he says. All you see is the artist’s work. I’m just another pencil. I’m just another brush. But I want the pencil to be sharpened really well. I want the brush to be sable. And to do that and be completely spontaneous, I trust the materials.”

                  <p>I love these busy, wordy, and brightly colored sweaters from Kendall Ross. From her about page:
Kendall Ross, aka “I’d Knit That”, is an Oklahoma City based fiber artist. She is best known for hand-knitting colorful, wearable art pieces. She uses intricate hand-knitting colorwork methods like intarsia and fair isle to illustrate images and incorporate her original texts into the fabric of her work. Each stitch on every sweater, vest, mural, and textile is painstakingly planned and knit over countless hours using two needles and wool.

                  <p>In the early days of the telegraph, station operators began sharing the local weather with each other. As the practice became more widespread, people started to realize that what happened in one location translated to later events in another location. Modern weather forecasting and the concept of weather systems were born.
The operators had discovered something both interesting and paradoxical, the writer Andrew Blum observes in his book The Weather Machine. The telegraph had collapsed time but, in doing so, it had somehow simultaneously created more of it. Now people could see what the future held before it happened; they could know that a storm was on its way hours before the rain started falling or the clouds appeared in the sky. This new, real-time information also did something else, Blum points out. It allowed weather to be visualized as a system, transforming static, localized pieces of data into one large and ever-shifting whole.

                  <p>This is probably the weirdest thing you’ll see all week: Bobby Fingers (who you might remember from his diorama of Michael Jackson on fire) made a rowboat shaped like the head of Jeff Bezos. The head is super-realistic and the head/boat is big enough to hold at least one person. What a delightfully odd mixture of exacting craftsmanship, performance art, comedy, and just plain WTF. Slightly NSFW (hairy butt cheeks). (via waxy)

                  <p>In their latest video, Kurzgesagt takes a break from their more serious topics to consider a scenario from the realm of science fiction: interstellar combat. Using technology that is theoretically available to us here on Earth, could a more advanced civilization some 42 light years away destroy our planet without any warning? They outline three potential weapons: the Star Laser, the Relativistic Missile, and the Ultra-Relativistic Electron Beam.
Here’s what I don’t understand though: how would the targeting work? In order for an alien civilization to hit the Earth with a laser from 42 light years away, it has to not only predict, within a margin of error of the Earth’s diameter, precisely where the Earth is going to be, but also have a system capable of aiming across 42 light years of distance with that precision. Is this even possible? How precisely do we know where the Earth is going to be in 42 years? And if you’re aiming at something 42 light years away, if you move the sights a nanometer, how much angular distance does that shift the the destination by? And how much does the gravity of matter along the way shift the trajectory and is it possible to accurately compensate for that? Maybe this should be their next video…

From wood gas to plastic waste
During the Second World War, many motorized vehicles in continental Europe were converted to drive on firewood. 1 That happened as a consequence of the rationing of fossil fuels. Wood gas vehicles were a not-so-elegant alternative to their petrol cousins, but their range was comparable to today’s electric vehicles. In Germany alone, around 500,000 wood gas cars, buses, and trucks operated by the end of WWII. An even more cumbersome alternative was the gas bag vehicle. 2
Nowadays, there’s much less firewood available than in the 1940s, especially in industrialized regions. So, what would be the solution to the disruption of gasoline or electricity in the Third World War? Dutch artist Gijs Schal…</p>

                  <p>Philip Glass is coming out with a new album early next year called Philip Glass Solo. It was recorded during the early days of the pandemic at Glass’s home on his piano.
This is my piano, the instrument on which most of the music was written. It’s also the same room where I have worked for decades in the middle of the energy which New York City itself has brought to me. The listener may hear the quiet hum of New York in the background or feel the influence of time and memory that this space affords. To the degree possible, I made this record to invite the listener in.


The video above is a lovely clip of him, in his home, playing one of the songs off the album.

                  <p>Darrin Bell, who won the 2019 Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning, wrote a graphic novel called The Talk about the conversation that parents have to have with their Black children in America about police, racism, and safety.
Darrin Bell was six years old when his mother told him he couldn’t have a realistic water gun. She said she feared for his safety, that police tend to think of little Black boys as older and less innocent than they really are. Through evocative illustrations and sharp humor, Bell examines how The Talk shaped intimate and public moments from childhood to adulthood.


Deirdre Sugiuchi talked with Bell about the book for Electric Lit. I think this question &amp; answer was particularly interesting:

                  <p>The David Rumsey Map Collection is one of the true gems of the web: a massive trove of maps &amp; related images from over 40 years of collecting.
Rumsey began building a collection of North and South American historical maps and related cartographic materials in 1980. Eventually the collection expanded to include historical maps of the entire world, from the 16th to the 21st centuries. His collection, with more than 200,000 maps, is one of the largest private map collections in the United States.


Italian filmmaker Andrea Gatopoulos has made a documentary film called A Stranger Quest about Rumsey’s passion for maps. Here’s the trailer:

And because I can’t resist, a few maps from the collection:




That last one is a screenshot of the results for “lighthouse” from their new Text-On-Maps search capability.

                  <p>This is a map of how people in different geographic regions of the US refer to athletic footwear, courtesy of Josh Katz, author of Speaking American: How Y’all, Youse, and You Guys Talk and co-creator of that NY Times dialect quiz that went viral 10 years ago.

Growing up in northern Wisconsin, we said “tennis shoes” or “tennies” most of the time (even though very little actual tennis was being played) and “gym shoes” less often. I hadn’t really heard of “sneakers” as a kid and never used it. (Shoes for sneaking? Huh?) My kids were born in NYC and they give me shit every time I tell them to put their tennies on. 🤷‍♂️
What do you call athletic shoes? Tennies? Sneakers? Kicks? Trainers? Gym shoes? Some other weird thing? (via @dens)

                  <p>The event ran last Friday and (thankfully) as usual, going by all the people I spoke to, it was a huge success.
In previous years I&#x27;ve been asked &quot;what&#x27;s the theme this year&quot;, and as far as I can remember, I&#x27;ve never had a theme. Though this year (as I&#x27;ve seen in others) a theme did emerge by itself: the theme of connecting people.</p>

                  <p>This fascinating and well-produced video from Vox introduces us to what happens to materials that are put under vast amounts of pressure — I’m talking center of the Sun pressures upwards of 100 billion atmospheres. Scientists are just beginning their explorations of the strange things that happen “when you keep squeezing”.
Tens of thousands of kilometers below Jupiter’s surface, physicists think hydrogen will go through another change becoming a shiny conductor of electricity. It’s thought that a lot of Jupiter is made up of this metallic hydrogen.
We think of high energy density materials as completely inverting the periodic table. So your metals become transparent and your transparent materials become metals. And all these gases become solids…


Water transforms into ice that conducts electricity: Black, Hot Ice May Be Nature’s Most Common Form of Water. Hydrogen can be compressed into a metal: Metallic hydrogen finally made in lab at mind-boggling pressure. Sodium can turn clear: Metal Discovered To Become Transparent Under High Pressure. So weird and interesting!

                  <p>I love this otherworldly shot of Stonehenge from Reuben Wu. It’s a variant of his cover image for the August 2022 issue of National Geographic. The monument is lit from above and behind with drones, which created some logistical issues:
[We] had to call the Royal Air Force each time we launched the drone, and spent months getting permits and approval to do this. Even then we still couldn’t fly it above the stone circle (for fear of damaging the stones).


They had to call the RAF because the monument is in military airspace. This short behind-the-scenes video has more:
While we were making these images, something that was always very present was the sound of the traffic on the nearby A303 highway, and I was certain that passing motorists would have been alarmed to see what looked like an alien spacecraft flitting around above the 5,000 year old megalith.

In parliamentary democracies, the coalitions are visible, when they come together to form the government. In a dictatorship, the coalitions are hidden to everyone except infighting princelings and courtiers (until a general or minister is executed, exiled or thrown in prison.) In a two-party system, the coalitions are inside the parties – not quite as explicit as the coalition governments in a multi…</p>

                  <p>About ten years ago, after a long campaign by Navajo Nation member Manny Wheeler, Disney/Lucasfilm released the first Star Wars movie dubbed into the Navajo language. In this clip from the PBS series Native America, the Navajo version of Star Wars is shown at a drive-in in Arizona, with some of the voice actors who contributed to the dub in attendance. Some Navajo feel a strong connection to some of the themes in the movie:
The Force and the universe is all interconnected. When you put that in the Navajo language, especially for an elder to hear that, they’re going to just be thinking, like, yeah, of course. It’s not just a movie. That’s stuff we really believe.


You can watch the Navajo version of Star Wars on Disney+ (Finding Nemo too!) and catch the second season of Native America on PBS. Oh, and here’s a movie poster for the film:

                  <p>I’ve been using nix for about 9 months now.
For all of that time I’ve been steadfastly ignoring flakes, but everyone keeps
saying that flakes are great and the best way to use nix, so I decided to try
to figure out what the deal is with them.
I found it very hard to find simple examples of flake files and I ran into a
few problems that were very confusing to me, so I wanted to write down some very
basic examples and some of the problems I ran into in case it’s helpful to
someone else who’s getting started with flakes.
First, let’s talk about what a flake is a little.
flakes are self-contained
Every explanation I’ve found of flakes explains them in terms of other nix
concepts (“flakes simplify nix usability”, “flakes are processors of Nix
code”). Personally I really needed a way to think ab…</p>

                  <p>To mark the 10th anniversary of their YouTube channel, Kurzgesagt has released a video timeline of the Earth’s evolution, all 4.5 billion years of it. The video is 60 minutes long, which means that each second shows about 1 million years. And it’s kind of a music video…of sorts? There’s talking but there are definitely stretches of just music and visuals…it’s not your usual science explainer video.
Hop on a musical train ride and experience how long a billion years really is. It’s the perfect background for your next party, a great way to take a break from studying, or a fascinating companion while you’re on the go.

                  <p>Before the iPod, before the Walkman, there was the Mikiphone, a portable record player that folded up into a case that you could fit in your pocket. Invented circa 1924, this portable phonograph was powered by a hand-crank and could play 10-inch records. 
At first glance, the closed Mikiphone appears quite compact, easily fitting inside a purse.
However, it requires some assembly, with its components stored within the case, which, when shut, measures just 11.5 cm in diameter and 4.7 cm in thickness.
The recording head and a two-piece Bakelite resonator had to be connected to the foldout tone arm before the shellac disc could be placed on the turntable’s central pin.
This precision engineering feat was awarded first prize at an international music exhibition in Geneva in 1927.

                  <p>An incredible deep dive into the golden age of gadget catalogs. Love the bloggy voice…somehow I had never heard of any of these. These names though: “Our Space-age Product Catalog” &amp; “Products That Think”. 😍

                  <p>I watched David Fincher’s The Killer last night (loved it, actually) and enjoyed Max Read’s take: “…it reminds us that throughout his career Fincher has been in dialogue with the concerns of 4chan and the rest of Loser Internet”.

                  <p>The premiere date for the Netflix adaptation of Liu Cixin’s Three-Body Problem trilogy by Game of Thrones showrunners D.B. Weiss and David Benioff inches ever closer and, well, I just really want this to be good (because I enjoyed the book series so much). Between the teaser trailer and the clip above, I am cautiously optimistic. 3 Body Problem is out on Netflix on March 21, 2024.

                  <p>At the beginning of the ninth episode of his 13-part series Cosmos: A Personal Voyage, Carl Sagan says:
If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe.


Taking a page from Sagan’s book, Zack Scholl made a site called Recursive Recipes, which allows you to drill down into the ingredients of some common foods, replacing them with other recipes.
A recursive recipe is one where ingredients in the recipe can be replaced by another recipe. The more ingredients you replace, the more that the recipe is made truly from scratch.


Here’s what the apple pie recipe looks like when you make everything you can from scratch:

You don’t quite begin at the Big Bang, but if you start with soil, a cow, and some seawater, it’s still going to take you almost 8 years to make that pie. The wheat needed for the flour, for instance:
Plant winter wheat in fall to allow for six to eight weeks of growth before the soil freezes. This allows time for good root development. If the wheat is planted too early, it may smother itself the following spring and it could be vulnerable to some late-summer insects that won’t be an issue in the cooler fall weather. If winter wheat is planted too late, it will not overwinter well.


This reminds me of Thomas Thwaites’ Toaster Project, in which he built a toaster from scratch:

Thwaites reverse engineered a seven dollar toaster into 400 separate parts and then set about recreating steel from iron ore rocks, plastic from microwaved potatoes and copper from homemade bromide mush.

                  <p>I just found out today that they made a movie version of Ian Frazier’s classic 1990 New Yorker piece Coyote V. Acme, in which Wile E. Coyote files a product liability lawsuit against the Acme Company.
Mr. Coyote states that on December 13th he received of Defendant via parcel post one Acme Rocket Sled. The intention of Mr. Coyote was to use the Rocket Sled to aid him in pursuit of his prey. Upon receipt of the Rocket Sled Mr. Coyote removed it from its wooden shipping crate and, sighting his prey in the distance, activated the ignition.

                  <p>Hello! I was trying to explain to someone how git cherry-pick works the other
day, and I found myself getting confused.
What went wrong was: I thought that git cherry-pick was basically applying a
patch, but when I tried to actually do it that way, it didn’t work!
Let’s talk about what I thought cherry-pick did (applying a patch), why
that’s not quite true, and what it actually does instead (a “3-way merge”).
This post is extremely in the weeds and you definitely don’t need to understand
this stuff to use git effectively. But if you (like me) are curious about git’s
internals, let’s talk about it!
cherry-pick isn’t applying a patch
The way I previously understood git cherry-pick COMMIT_ID is:
calculate the diff for COMMIT_ID, like git show COMMIT_ID --patch &gt; out.patch
Apply the patch to t…</p>

                  <p>Nearly everything about Fortnite’s popular Battle Royale mode is geared towards creating conflict between its players. In this episode of Pop Culture Detective, Jonathan McIntosh explores whether you can be a pacifist in a virtual world filled with war and, beyond that, whether you can make friends with your fiercest enemy. As a Fortnite player who has qualms about even the cartoony violence in the game, I loved this video. It reminded me of Robin Sloan’s piece in the Atlantic from 2018: I Played Fortnite and Figured Out the Universe.
When they’re successful, these negotiations are honestly more nervy and exciting than the game’s most intense shoot-outs. I’m not the only one who thinks so. In forums dedicated to Fortnite Battle Royale, some players share clips of chance alliances, and others reply glumly: “Super rare to find someone [who] won’t shoot you when you emote.” I dream of a Political Fortnite in which victory goes not to the twitchiest sniper but the most charismatic organizer, with factions forming and dissolving… I imagine the fear and thrill of seeing not one but a dozen tiny silhouettes on the far ridge-a war band sweeping fast down the hillside. I’m outnumbered; can I convince them to let me join them?


(thx, andy)

Sitting at my desk is always right. I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about how to make good work. There are millions of tips and tricks and manifestos out there. But at the end there’s only one single truth for me: sit down and start drawing.

                  <p>A quick and breezy introduction to some basic wayfinding techniques from Fran Scott and BBC Earth Kids. Unless you went to camp as a kid or have spent a bunch of time outdoors, at least some of these techniques will be new to you. I’d never heard of trees growing in a check mark shape. From natural navigation expert Tristan Gooley:
Obviously, all green plants need sunlight. So it’s logical that plants will, all things being equal, tend to grow more abundantly on the side the light comes from. In the northern parts of the world, where the sun is due south in the middle of the day, that means plants are growing more abundantly on the south side.
Try noticing this in a tree the next time you take a walk outside. You should see that there’s more tree on the south side, unless there are other factors-for instance there are amazing examples of glass buildings that can make trees grow the wrong way. But generally speaking, there should be more of the tree on the south side.


Gooley is the author of The Lost Art of Reading Nature’s Signs: Use Outdoor Clues to Find Your Way, Predict the Weather, Locate Water, Track Animals — and Other Forgotten Skills and several related books. (via the kid should see this)

                  <p>Using a custom hydrogen alpha solar telescope, Jason Kurth took a collection of high-resolution photographs of the recent annular solar eclipse and arranged them into an 8K video of the event. The level of detail here is incredible — you can see solar flares and features on the surface of the Sun pulsing and shifting as the Moon moves across it. You can see a bit of Kurth’s setup on Instagram.

                  <p>A few decades ago, Chérie Carter-Scott devised a list of 10 Rules for Being Human, which was published in her 1998 book If Life Is a Game, These Are the Rules. These rules are often presented on social media as being “handed down from ancient Sanskrit” but their more recent origin shouldn’t keep us from learning what we can from them. Here they are:
You will receive a body. You may love it or hate it, but it will be yours for the duration of your life on Earth.
You will be presented with lessons. You are enrolled in a full-time informal school called ‘life.’ Each day in this school you will have the opportunity to learn lessons. You may like the lessons or hate them, but you have designed them as part of your curriculum.



There are no mistakes, only lessons. Growth is a process of experimentation, a series of trials, errors, and occasional victories. The failed experiments are as much a part of the process as the experiments that work.



A lesson is repeated until learned. Lessons will be repeated to you in various forms until you have learned them. When you have learned them, you can then go on to the next lesson.



Learning does not end. There is no part of life that does not contain lessons. If you are alive, there are lessons to be learned.



“There” is no better than “here”. When your “there” has become a “here”, you will simply obtain a “there” that will look better to you than your present “here”.



Others are only mirrors of you. You cannot love or hate something about another person unless it reflects something you love or hate about yourself.



What you make of your life is up to you. You have all the tools and resources you need. What you do with them is up to you.



Your answers lie inside of you. All you need to do is look, listen, and trust.



You will forget all of this at birth. You can remember it if you want by unraveling the double helix of inner knowing.

Update: Chris Glass had a lovely experience with Carter-Scott’s book recently.

If you want a default layout for all pages there&#x27;s a few ways you can do this (which is why I found it hard to determine from the docs), but since I almost always have an .eleventy.js configuration file, putting it there is (what I think) the cleanest solution:
// assumes that &#x60;base.njk&#x60; lives inside _includes/
eleventyConfig.addGlobalData(&#x27;layout&#x27;, &#x27;base.njk&#x27;);</p>

                  <p>The Nature Conservancy has announced this year’s winners of their annual photo contest. Collectively, the winning photographs “gave voice to nature and showed us the power and peril of the natural world”. As usual, I selected a few of my favorites and included them above. From top to bottom:
Jaime Daniel Fajardo Torres: “This is a species of spider known as ogre spiders, of the genus Deinopis. The photograph was taken at night in the middle of a mature forest in northern Ecuador in the tropical rainforest of the Ecuadorian Chocó, a place considered a hotspot. The spider photographed was generating its egg sac with its own web.”
HJ Yang: An orca attacks two seals in the morning on the beach.



Jeanny Tang: “The holes dug by fish for spawning can be seen after the pond has dried up.”

                  <p>The four members of the Beatles, assisted by machine learning technology, come together one last time to record a song together, working off of a demo tape recorded by John Lennon in the 70s.
The long mythologised John Lennon demo was first worked on in February 1995 by Paul, George and Ringo as part of The Beatles Anthology project but it remained unfinished, partly because of the impossible technological challenges involved in working with the vocal John had recorded on tape in the 1970s. For years it looked like the song could never be completed.
But in 2022 there was a stroke of serendipity. A software system developed by Peter Jackson and his team, used throughout the production of the documentary series Get Back, finally opened the way for the uncoupling of John’s vocal from his piano part. As a result, the original recording could be brought to life and worked on anew with contributions from all four Beatles.


Here’s the result, a song called Now and Then:

I enjoyed Ben Lindbergh’s take on the new song and its recording.

The idea that a company can do anything to create or perpetuate a monopoly so long as its prices go down and/or its quality goes up is directly to blame for the rise of Big Tech.

                  <p>Hello! While talking with folks about Git, I’ve been seeing a comment over and
over to the effect of “I hate rebase”. People seemed to feel pretty strongly
about this, and I was really surprised because I don’t run into a lot of
problems with rebase and I use it all the time.
I’ve found that if many people have a very strong opinion that’s different from
mine, usually it’s because they have different experiences around that thing
from me.
So I asked on Mastodon:
today I’m thinking about the tradeoffs of using git rebase a bit. I think
the goal of rebase is to have a nice linear commit history, which is something
I like.
but what are the costs of using rebase? what problems has it caused for you
in practice? I’m really only interested in specific bad experiences you’ve had
here – not opinio…</p>

How close are we to the Speakularity today? Or is it still in the distance?

                  <p>In 2011, Robin Sloan wrote “Blessed Are the Toolmakers.” It’s a (light) rejection of the urge to make general-purpose software and platforms in favor of something smaller yet more productive.
“I wish more people were making tools for a specific creative purpose rather than for general consumer adoption. I wish more people were making tools that very intentionally do not scale—tools with users by the dozen. Tools you experience not through a web signup form, but through pathbreaking creative work.
“I guess I want fewer aspirational Apples and more Pixar wannabes.”</p>

                  <p>Tomorrow, November 4th, 2023, is my first wedding anniversary. I married Karen McGrane at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia in 2022. We walked down the aisle to Gonzo’s “I’m Going To Back There Someday.” It was one of the best days of my life.
To celebrate our anniversary, I’m reposting what I wrote shortly after I moved into Karen’s house (which also, somewhat unusually, was the first time we met in person). It’s also the most recent — and since we haven’t renewed our WordPress license, quite possibly the last — post on Snarkmarket.com. I hope Kottke.org readers enjoy it.
Why write a blog post somewhere nobody has published in five years, in a new WordPress interface where you recognize… yeah, nothing? Where somehow you can’t even upload a JPG or PNG file you downloaded from another …</p>

                  <p>As front-end developers, we often learn CSS by focusing on individual properties. Instead, we should focus on how the language uses those properties to calculate layouts. In this blog post, we&#x27;ll pop the hood on CSS and see how the language is structured, and how to learn it effectively.</p>

                  <p>Somehow Snarkmarket contains no links to one of my favorite essays of all time, “As We May Think,” by Vannevar Bush. Our esteemed host has linked to it, of course, because Kottke.org is an unparalleled collection of fine hypertext products. But I think it’s worth a repeat. Many people know this essay, but most still don’t.
Bush was part of the Oppenheimer set; he was an engineer whose work was critical to the creation of the atomic bomb. By the time this essay was published, Mussolini and Hitler were dead, and World War II was almost over. He begins from a perspective I find cold and alienating, that of a scientist exhilarated by an intellectual pursuit that has left millions dead and more devastated. He doesn’t reckon with this even as he writes a paean to what science has accomplished:

                  <p>Earlier this week, Dave Winer (the inventor of RSS and lots of other notable software, and one of the earliest bloggers) made a podcast for me. He posted it publicly, so it wasn’t sealed like a letter, but it was addressed to me and responding to something I wrote on Threads. I don’t think I’ve ever been the personal addressee of a podcast before: like an @-reply, but in audio.
For some reason, it reminded me of the poet Frank O’Hara’s “Personism” manifesto:
[Personism] was founded by me after lunch with LeRoi Jones on August 27, 1959, a day in which I was in love with someone (not Roi, by the way, a blond). I went back to work and wrote a poem for this person. While I was writing it I was realizing that if I wanted to I could use the telephone instead of writing the poem, and so Personism…</p>

                  <p>By the end of 2015, Snarkmarket had slowed way, way down. But its writers would still pop by from time to time to revisit the site and write something for its community. (“A hardy desert ecosystem,” Robin once called it.) This post, “Unforgotten,” by Matt Thompson reflects on blogging a decade after its peak.
“Blogs like this one are speakeasies now, not raucous pubs. I don’t actually know if fewer people are ‘reading blogs’ or if it’s that the web has grown so much larger that the boutique communities of yesteryear merely feel less significant. But I will say, I find enduring and immense value in this place, in the fact that you’re here, reading these words, however you’ve found them. Speakeasies can be marvelous spots.”</p>

But first, we did a year-long online seminar to prepare how we wanted to rethink the site.</p>

Flow is the feed. It’s the posts and the tweets. It’s the stream of daily and sub-daily updates that reminds people you exist.

Stock is the durable stuff. It’s the content you produce that’s as interesting in two months (or two years) as it is today. It’s what people discover via search. It’s what spreads slowly but surely, building fans over time.</p>

                  <p>Once, Kottke.org’s tagline was “Liberal Arts 2.0.” It’s a terrific description of everything the blog covers and how Jason covers it; unpacking the web with a humanist lens, looking for noteworthy specimens and bigger connections. 
It also chimed with “Web 2.0,” which was a popular descriptive and prescriptive phrase at the time. Tim Berners-Lee famously derided “Web 2.0” as “jargon,” claiming that the web was always intended to be a social and collaborative medium and that the things the proponents of a web renewal wanted to emphasize were there from the start. Which is… basically accurate!
But the liberal arts badly needed (and still badly need) an update for the age of the web. So many of the big Web 2.0 projects (social networking and commerce, folksonomies, the web as a development pl…</p>

                  <p>Today, November 3rd, is my 44th birthday. Tomorrow, the 4th, is my first wedding anniversary. But today is also an important day in my personal history of the web, and I’d argue, in the history of blogging, or at least our corner of it. It’s the twentieth anniversary of Snarkmarket, founded by Robin Sloan and Matt Thompson. It’s also the fifteenth anniversary of the day I joined as the site’s third blogger, or Snarkmaster, after five years of being part of the site’s community (the Snarkmatrix). (Coincidentally, Obama was first elected President that November 4th. It was a really good couple of days.)
If you didn’t have the good fortune to read Snarkmarket while it was active, I’ll give you a quick précis. Robin and Matt both graduated college in 2002, then completed a year of journalism s…</p>

                  <p>It’s a pleasure to be here in Jason’s esteemed garden of links and digressions, celebrating 20 years since we created Snarkmarket. In keeping with our host’s splendid curatorial style, most of what I’ll post here are not little bloggy essays like this one. But there’s one thing I especially wanted to ask this crowd about.
Few people would ever have known about Snarkmarket if not for the short video Robin and I made, EPIC 2014 (and then, a year later, 2015), that went viral in an era of the internet in which virality was difficult. To make a video viral in 2004 meant people mirroring a file on their private servers, linking to it on their blogs, and emailing links to friends and colleagues. But the video itself imagined that friction as a thing of the past. YouTube didn’t yet exist, but we’…</p>

                  <p>In the past few decades, we’ve found out a great deal about pre-Columbian civilizations &amp; inhabitants of the Americas, including those in the Amazon rainforest, where settlements were larger and more numerous than previously believed.
When European colonizers arrived in the 16th century, they were captivated by rumors of a golden city, hidden somewhere in the rainforest. Their search for “El Dorado” lasted more than a century, but only resulted in disaster, death, and further conquest of the indigenous people there.
Experts thereafter looked at the Amazon and saw only a desolate jungle; too harsh for extensive agriculture and therefore sparsely populated. They believed that it had always been this way.
Until recently.
Beginning in the late 20th century, archaeologists began looking more closely at the forest floor. Working with the indigenous people who still remained there, they excavated long ditches and mounds. After mapping them, they could see that these were the markings of large settlements; walls, moats, plazas, and roads that connected even more settlements. And they were all over the Amazon.

Medieval dachshund - Or: drawing with words
Here are three examples of a technique called “micrography”: decorative scenes that are drawn with words written in a tiny script. While there are examples from Latin books made in the West (here is one), the technique is particularly common in medieval Hebrew manuscripts. The drawings are usually found in biblical manuscripts and they appear to be commentaries to the text. The technique, whereby a scribe wrote in the smallest handwriting possible, goes back to the 9th century AD. The examples here, from the 13th century, shows just how entertaining the word-made drawings can be: they are an opportunity for the scribe to frolick in the margins of the page - like drawing a creature that looks like a dachshund.

                  <p>Hello everyone, I’ve got a bit of a treat for you. Tomorrow (Nov 3) marks the 20th anniversary of Snarkmarket, a quietly influential group blog that featured the writing of Tim Carmody, Matt Thompson, Robin Sloan, and a few other contributors. There hasn’t been much activity over there for several years, but it was a must-read for me back in the day (with a lively comments section) — you may remember the EPIC video that Robin and Matt made (oh, seeing that old design brings back memories!) or Robin’s evergreen classic on stock &amp; flow.
Anyway, tomorrow Matt, Robin, and Tim are taking over kottke.org to celebrate their anniversary, reminisce about the Good Old Days, and perhaps opine a bit about how people relating to each other online has changed in the 20 years since the formation of the Snarkmatrix. Comments will be on and they’ll be in there mixing it up with you.
So then: I hereby declare November 3, 2023 Snarkmarket Day on kottke.org. Bake it away, toys!

                  <p>Using survey data, responses from community boards &amp; city council members, and over 37,000 responses from NYC residents, a team at the NY Times has made a detailed map of the 350+ distinct neighborhoods in NYC. From a companion article:
It’s a New York pastime to gripe that neighborhoods are invented and defined by real estate brokers, developers and other city gatekeepers. But the more interesting truth may be that they are also reinvented and reinforced, refracted through race and class, by us: by the air traffic controller who lives in Little Yemen, by the Manhattan community manager who’s sure his constituents live in East Harlem — and not “Upper Carnegie Hill” — and by the Brooklyn residents who decided to name a relatively flat piece of land Boerum Hill.
A name has power. It can foreshadow who will be moving in. By itself, it can conjure so much: gentrification, displacement, inequality, status. When we argue over names, or even invent new ones, we may be trying to exert some of that power — or lamenting that others have more power than we do.
We asked New Yorkers themselves to map their neighborhoods and to tell us what they call them. The result, while imperfect, is probably the most detailed map of the city’s neighborhoods ever compiled.


The article is interesting throughout:
Our map reveals two main kinds of divisions: sharp ones and fuzzy ones.
The fuzzy ones often reflect areas in transition or dispute, where there’s no consensus or where gentrification is rewriting boundaries in real time.
The sharp ones often reflect features of the landscape itself: wide avenues, highways, remnants of canals. When you cross the street, you know you’re in another neighborhood.


Next time I’m in NYC, I’m definitely going to Little Yemen for lunch.

                  <p>Usability and aesthetics usually go hand in hand.
In fact, there is even what we call the “Aesthetic Usability Effect”:
users perceive beautiful interfaces as easier to use and cut them more slack when it comes to minor usabiity issues.
Unfortunately, sometimes usability and aesthetics can be at odds, also known as “form over function”.
Simplicity, and knowing when to stop
A common incarnation of form-over-function, is when designers start identifying signifiers and affordances as noise to be eliminated,
sacrificing a great deal of learnability for an — often marginal — improvement in aesthetics.
Aesthetic and Minimalist Design is one of the Nielsen/Norman core usability heuristics (and all other heuristics taxonomies have something similar).
More poetically, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry said …</p>

                  <p>I know I always say this, but I didn’t mean for so much time to elapse since the last installment of the media diet. But I have a slightly different reason for the delay this time: I have been really busy with work and family stuff, so much so that I haven’t been reading or watching as much as I usually do. So I needed to wait a couple of months to collect enough stuff.
Anyway. Here’s my recent media diet, a roundup of what I’ve been reading, watching, listening to, and experiencing over the past few months. ✌️

                  <p>If you look closely at a rainbow made from sunlight (e.g. through a prism or an actual rainbow), you’ll notice that some of the colors are missing. It turns out that these absent colors (called Fraunhofer lines) have something to do with the types of elements that are present in the Sun (and the Earth’s atmosphere). Dr. Joe Hanson explains in the video above.
Over 200 years ago, scientists were looking at sunlight through a prism when they noticed that part of the rainbow was missing. There were dark lines where there should have been colors. Since then, scientists have unlocked the secrets encoded in these lines, using it to uncover mind-boggling facts about the fundamental nature of our universe and about worlds light-years away.


Science is fascinating…Fraunhofer lines can tell us something about objects and processes all along the Powers of Ten scale, from the inner workings of the atom to the composition of the Earth’s atmosphere to how quickly the universe is expanding or contracting.
If you’d like to check out the missing parts of the rainbow for yourself, you can make this DIY spectroscope using a CD or DVD and a few other items. (via the kid should see this)

                  <p>Hello! I’m slowly working on explaining git. One of my biggest problems is that
after almost 15 years of using git, I’ve become very used to git’s
idiosyncracies and it’s easy for me to forget what’s confusing about it.
So I asked people on Mastodon:
what git jargon do you find confusing? thinking of writing a blog post that explains some of git’s weirder terminology: “detached HEAD state”, “fast-forward”, “index/staging area/staged”, “ahead of ‘origin/main’ by 1 commit”, etc
I got a lot of GREAT answers and I’ll try to summarize some of them here.  Here’s a list of the terms:
HEAD and “heads”
“detached HEAD state”
“ours” and “theirs” while merging or rebasing
“Your branch is up to date with ‘origin/main’”
HEAD^, HEAD~ HEAD^^, HEAD~~, HEAD^2, HEAD~2
.. and …
“can be fast-forwarded”
“refere…</p>

                  <p>YouTube channel Polyphonic (whose videos I’ve featured before) has taken on an ambitious project: tracing the history of the electric guitar solo from its origins in blues and country music in the American South all the way up to the present day. The series is called Axe To Grind and the first three episodes are available on YouTube (the first two are embedded above). People are sharing their favorite early electric guitar players in the comments of the first video.
The series is also available on the subscription-only Nebula — episodes appear there first and the music excerpts are longer because Nebula doesn’t trample all over creators’ fair use rights like YT does. (via open culture)

                  <p>Fungi: Web of Life is an upcoming IMAX documentary on mushrooms &amp; their fungi brethren narrated by Björk and presented by Merlin Sheldrake.
Join acclaimed British biologist, Dr. Merlin Sheldrake, on a quest to find an incredibly precious blue mushroom, against the backdrop of Tasmania’s ancient Tarkine rainforest. Merlin will show us some the grandest and strangest organisms ever discovered, showcased through jaw-dropping time-lapse cinematography, in a landscape largely unchanged from the time of the dinosaurs. Fungi have important lessons to teach humanity about survival through cooperation. Indeed, these incredible lifeforms may hold the key to solving some of humanity’s most urgent problems. With millions more species to discover, our journey into the secret world of fungi has only just begun.


Sheldrake is the author of Entangled Life: How Fungi Make Our Worlds, Change Our Minds &amp; Shape Our Futures.

                  <p>Based on the bestselling book Stamped from the Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America by Ibram X. Kendi (also available as a graphic novel), this documentary explores the mythology of American racism and how it still shapes the world today. The director is Oscar-winner Roger Ross Williams and in preparing for the film, he decided that only Black women would appear in it:
“When we started looking at historians and scholars, we came up with a long list. I noticed the pattern that most of the people doing the work around racism in America were Black women,” Williams told Netflix. “I asked them in pre-interviews, ‘Why do you do this work?’ And many of them said the same thing — that they had no choice. This was their experience and their life. And if they’re going to dedicate their life to something, it’s going to be about changing and understanding racism in America because they can’t escape racism in America. I said to everyone, ‘We’re going to have only Black women in this film.’ It was an important statement to make.


Stamped From the Beginning comes out on Netflix on November 20.

                  <p>Lego master Jumpei Mitsui spent over 400 hours building a 3D version of Hokusai’s Great Wave off Kanagawa out of 50,000 Lego bricks — you can watch a time lapse of the construction in the video above. The build was included at an exhibition of Hokusai’s work at the MFA in Boston:
In order to create Hokusai’s Wave in three dimensions, he made a detailed study of rogue waves and their characteristics. He also drew on childhood memories of waves near his family home at Akashi on the Inland Sea.


The video slows down to realtime in spots, so you can see how fast he’s actually building (quite fast). And you can also see the level of trial and error involved as he builds and then un-builds the waves until he’s happy with them. (via the kid should see this)

                  <p>The surprising scientific weirdness of glass. “Glass is so much weirder than a very slow-moving liquid. […] The simplest explanation for how glass forms is that it’s a liquid that cools too quickly for those crystals to form.”

Also good from the same episode: a soul food cooking competition:

                  <p>There are only a couple of things I like about Halloween: 1. Heidi Klum’s costumes (last year she dressed up as a worm), and 2. the relatively recent Japanese tradition of mundane Halloween costumes. From Spoon &amp; Tamago and Nick Kapur (here too), here are a few of my favorite mundane costumes:

“Factory worker who wore a helmet all day”

“Person who was about to be late for work, but then their train got delayed and now they are taking their time since they got a proof-of-delay ticket from the station”

“Person taking a hearing test at the doctor’s office”
See also 2021’s best costumes, including “guy who leans in as his Mario Kart character turns a curve”.

                  <p>My friend&#x27;s son had a kid&#x27;s kindle that wasn&#x27;t charging any more. They were going to buy a replacement, but then asked me whether I thought it was fixable. Definitely!
I&#x27;d not fixed a Kindle before, but my guess was the USB port was probably at fault. Inspecting it under the microscope (and looking at the mouth of the port) I could see it was definitely the problem. It&#x27;s understandable that a young child isn&#x27;t always going to connect the USB cable cleanly and the port had eventually given up the ghost.
Opening the Kindle Fire is the process of unclipping the edge - there&#x27;s no screws on the outside. Once open, the main board can be lifted off, on the reverse side (to my photos) is a ribbon cable that can&#x27;t be disconnected right next to the USB port.
Using a hot air gun and lots of constant movement, I was able to free the USB port without melting the ribbon cable or the FPC connector (which is entirely plastic). By keeping the airflow moving it protects plastics from heating up but allows the solder to melt, but it takes practise and a careful hand.
Once free, I had a replacement from eBay and once re-installed the Kindle Fire charged up just like old times.
One more bit of tech saved from landfill 💪</p>

                  <p>Just hit play on this one and watch it. Absolutely magical…it sent shivers down my spine. The organization that arranged this is called Choir! Choir! Choir! and they also did a version of this in Dublin with 1000 people singing in tribute:

I’ve previously featured the group singing David Bowie’s Heroes with David Byrne, who said this of the experience:
What happens when one sings together with a lot of other people?
A couple of things I immediately noticed. There is a transcendent feeling in being subsumed and surrendering to a group. This applies to sports, military drills, dancing… and group singing. One becomes a part of something larger than oneself, and something in our makeup rewards us when that happens. We cling to our individuality, but we experience true ecstasy when we give it up.

                  <p>I enjoyed reading Ted Gioia’s list of 12 problems that he’s devoted his life to answering. Many of them go to the heart of how to lead a life of creativity and compassion, things which are often at odds in our culture.

It’s a scale for measuring how people visualize objects in their heads. I’m between 4 &amp; 5, which means I have a condition called aphantasia. Marco Giancotti recently wrote about this for Nautilus; he underwent an MRI scan to test what was going on in his head:
A few seconds pass, then a synthetic female voice speaks into my ears over the electronic clamor: “top hat.” I close my eyes and I imagine a top hat. A few seconds later a beep tells me I should rate the quality of my mental picture, which I do with a controller in my hand. The voice speaks again: “fire extinguisher,” and I repeat the routine. Next is “butterfly,” then “camel,” then “snowmobile,” and so on, for about 10 minutes, while the system monitors the activation of m…</p>

We’ll keep waking up, stuck in the same reality of oppression, carnage, and ruined lives until we can figure out how to effect meaningful change.

The home was a living world where you could discover books that were like doorways into poetic realms. The animation style was like Disney’s Fantasia meets late 90’s goth.

                  <p>Lego is coming out with a huge new set that’s based on Denis Villeneuve’s two-installment adaptation of Dune (or, as it’s know around these parts, DUNC). OMG, the Baron Harkonnen minifig!! It reminds me of something…ah yes:

Longbaron is looooooooong.
Anyway, it’s coming out in February and the main build is a 1369-piece model of the Atreides Royal Ornithopter with “fold-out, flappable wings, deployable landing gear and an opening cockpit”. Baron Harkooooooooooooonnen. I can’t stop! I, uh, may have pre-ordered this the second I saw it. (via polygon)
Update: Absolutely perfect:

                  </ul>
                  <p>From 1913 to 1944, amateur mycologist Hans Walty created hundreds of fantastic watercolor illustrations of mushrooms, which are available to peruse in very high-resolution at Wikimedia Commons. There’s not a great deal of information about Walty or his drawings online,1 but I did find this piece from the Swiss National Library. 
His images depict the colours and shapes of the mushrooms’ fruiting bodies and sometimes also include drawings of microscopic views. The fungi are usually depicted from the side and often from the top and bottom as well. Walty also frequently documented the characteristics of the stems, spores and undersides of the caps. The hobby mycologist also produced an explanatory book to accompany his illustrations that contains descriptions of the mushrooms, with each specimen being assigned a family and genus. His illustrations often contain notes about the time and date the mushroom was found and whether it was edible, inedible or poisonous.


Walty’s illustrations were published in multiple editions of a Swiss mushroom guide from the 40s through the 70s. According to the German version of Wikipedia (translated): “For decades, 500 of his illustrations on mushrooms were considered a standard work on mushroom identification, especially in Switzerland.”
Again, you can browse through hundreds of Walty’s mushroom illustrations at Wikimedia Commons. (thx, christoph)

Not in English at least; Walty was born in Italy and lived in Germany and Switzerland for much of his life. A biography is available on the German version of Wikipedia. ↩

                  <p>Papercraft artist Charles Young has been sourcing color combinations from this book and using them to construct extremely tidy and precise little buildings.
Starting in May 2020 I used Sanzo Wada&#x27;s Dictionary of Colour Combinations as inspiration for a new project introducing colour to my paper work for the first time. The book is made up of two, three and four colour combinations drawn from Japanese design and publishing in the early 20th century.


Check this out to get a sense of the scale — they&#x27;re really tiny. You can see many more of these on Instagram. It is actually hard to believe these are made out of paper and not computer generated. (via present &amp; correct)

                  <p>This story is a few years old but it charmed me too much this morning to let it slide. In 2017, four years after its grand reopening, Amsterdam&#x27;s Rijksmuseum welcomed its 10-millionth visitor, a man named Stefan Kasper. His lucky timing resulted in getting to spend the night in the museum, where he dined and slept underneath Rembrandt&#x27;s the Night Watch.

Here&#x27;s a short video of Kasper&#x27;s time in the museum:

I still can&#x27;t believe it. I discovered characters that I have never seen before. They came to life in front of me. It&#x27;s an experience that is forever etched in my memory.


Not the same, but I got to go to a press preview when the MoMA reopened a few years ago after renovations and it was quite an experience to wander those familiar galleries pretty much by myself. I stood in front of Starry Night and One: Number 31, 1950 for a really long time that morning.

                  </ul>
                  <p>In a piece about how English and North American robins (two unrelated species that don&#x27;t even share a biological genus or family) got their names, Robert Francis shares how some English birds were given people names...and some of them stuck.
During the 15th century, the English had an endearing practice of granting common human names to the birds that lived among them. Virtually every bird in that era had a name, and most of them, like Will Wagtail and Philip Sparrow have been long forgotten. Polly Parrot has stuck around, and Tom Tit and Jenny Wren, personable companions of the English countryside, are names still sometimes found in children&#x27;s rhymes. Other human names, however, have been incorporated so durably into the common names that still grace birds as to almost entirely obscure their origin. The Magpie, a loquacious black and white bird with a penchant for snatching shiny objects, once bore the simple name &quot;pie,&quot; probably coming from its Roman name, &quot;pica.&quot; The English named these birds Margaret, which was then abbreviated to Maggie, and finally left at Mag Pie.[2] The vocal, crow-like bird called Jackdaw was also once just a &quot;daw&quot; named &quot;Jack.&quot; 
The English also gave their ubiquitous and beloved orange-bellied, orb-shaped, wren-sized bird a human name. The first recorded Anglo-Saxon name for the Eurasian Robin was ruddoc, meaning &quot;little red one.&quot; By the medieval period, its name evolved to redbreast (the more accurate term orange only entered the English language when the fruit of the same name reached Great Britain in the 16th century). The English chose the satisfyingly alliterative name Robert for the redbreast, which they then changed to the popular Tudor nickname Robin. Soon enough, the name Robin Redbreast became so identified with the bird that Redbreast was dropped because it seemed so redundant.


I found this list of other people names for birds as well — other examples include jays and martins. (via @gretchenmcc)

                  <p>I am currently reading1 Lauren Groff&#x27;s The Vaster Wilds, so I was interested to read about her writing process, which includes:
When Groff starts something new, she writes it out longhand in large spiral notebooks. After she completes a first draft, she puts it in a bankers box — and never reads it again. Then she&#x27;ll start the book over, still in longhand, working from memory. The idea is that this way, only the best, most vital bits survive.
&quot;It&#x27;s not even the words on the page that accumulate, because I never look at them again, really, but the ideas and the characters start to take on gravity and density,&quot; she said.
&quot;Nothing matters except for these lightning bolts that I&#x27;ve discovered,&quot; she continued, &quot;the images that are happening, the sounds that are happening, that feel alive. Those are the only things that really matter from draft to draft.&quot;


And also this:
In the afternoon, Groff deals with the business of being an author, responding to emails, doing publicity, writing blurbs. And she reads. A lot. In just the past few days, she said, she finished &quot;Living and Dying With Marcel Proust,&quot; completed a reread of &quot;Moby Dick,&quot; and started a graphic novel called &quot;Roaming.&quot; She estimates she reads about 300 books a year.
Groff will drop quotes into casual conversation, citing, say, Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s take on form and function, but she manages to do this in an entirely unaffected way, just tossing out an interesting nugget for consideration. Her editor, McGrath, said that Groff reread all of Shakespeare so she could write a version of &quot;The Vaster Wilds&quot; in iambic pentameter &quot;just for fun,&quot; as a way for her to master Elizabethan rhythms.


All of Shakespeare, just for fun. Yep.

Or at least, trying to read. I&#x27;ve been super busy with work and at the end of the day, the last thing I want to do is read more. But I will get back to it!↩

                  <p>One of the things I was thinking about doing with the comments is having posts on Fridays that are specifically participatory. So let&#x27;s try it out today. Currently, there&#x27;s no profile information available for commenters...you can&#x27;t click on a name to visit their Instagram acct or whatever. That feature is on my to-do list but it might be awhile before I get to it. But I know folks are curious about who reads the site...
So, in the meantime, if you feel comfortable sharing, you can use this thread to introduce yourself: maybe where you live, what you&#x27;re into, your social accounts. I think many of us smartly err on the side of not sharing too many specific details about ourselves online (myself included, but it&#x27;s obviously complicated 🙃) due to safety issues, but I think it&#x27;s possible to get to know each other a little bit without spilling too many beans. (thx to Russell for the idea)

                  <p>Hey everyone. I rolled out a new comments system (in beta!) on Monday and it seems to have been well-received so far. I&#x27;ve fixed some of the most egregious bugs and rolled out some tweaks and it seems to be holding up pretty well. 🤞 (Is there a knock-on-wood emoji?)
It&#x27;s early days and I&#x27;m rolling things out slowly (only ~10 posts were open for comments this week out of about 50), but commenting activity waned as the week went on. Discovery is still poor (there&#x27;s no list of open comment threads) and there aren&#x27;t any notifications — even as an admin user, I have to go to the front page of the site and click into individual threads to see if there&#x27;s anything new. That&#x27;s an obvious hinderance to participation and I&#x27;m gonna make a first pass at fixing it next week.
I also recognize that it&#x27;s …</p>

                  <p>I’ve been very slowly working on writing about how Git works. I thought I
already knew Git pretty well, but as usual when I try to explain something I’ve
been learning some new things.
None of these things feel super surprising in retrospect, but I hadn’t thought
about them clearly before.
The facts are:
the “index”, “staging area” and “–cached” are all the same thing
the stash is a bunch of commits
not all references are branches or tags
merge commits aren’t empty
Let’s talk about them!
the “index”, “staging area” and “–cached” are all the same thing
When you run git add file.txt, and then git status, you’ll see something like this:
$ git add content/post/2023-10-20-some-miscellaneous-git-facts.markdown
$ git status

                  <p>The influential Whole Earth Catalog, along with a number of related publications, has been uploaded to The Internet Archive and is now available online for free at the Whole Earth Index. From Wired:
The Whole Earth Catalog was the proto-blog — a collection of reviews, how-to guides, and primers on anarchic libertarianism printed onto densely packed pages. It carried the tagline &quot;Access to Tools&quot; and offered know-how, product reviews, cultural analysis, and gobs of snark, long before you could get all that on the internet.
At the time of its initial publication in the late 1960s, the periodical became a beacon for techno-optimists and back-to-the-land hippies. The Whole Earth Catalog preached self-reliance, teaching young baby boomers how to build their own cabins, garden sheds, and geodesic domes after they had turned on, tuned in, and dropped out — well before they grew wealthy enough to buy up all the three-bedroom single-family homes. The catalog also had a profound impact on Silicon Valley&#x27;s ethos, and is credited with seeding the ideas that helped fuel today&#x27;s startup culture.

                  <p>Even if you haven&#x27;t seen Stop Making Sense, you are likely familiar with the herky jerky dance moves of Talking Heads&#x27; frontman David Byrne. In this video, which has only recently been made public, you can see Byrne practicing his now-iconic moves.
40 years ago, David Byrne rehearsed dances for Talking Heads&#x27; upcoming Speaking in Tongues tour by recording video of himself to determine which moves worked better than others, which developed into many of the iconic moves seen in the Stop Making Sense movie, filmed at the end of 1983 and released in 1984. It was recently rereleased by A24 in restored 4K. These videos, recorded in David Byrne&#x27;s loft, have been mentioned before in interviews and now after 40 years the footage is finally available!


If you don&#x27;t want to sit through the full 25-minute video, here&#x27;s an hors d&#x27;oeuvres version:

                  <p>For the New Yorker, Daniel Immerwahr reviews a new book, Steven Conn&#x27;s The Lies of the Land: Seeing Rural America for What It Is — and Isn&#x27;t (Bookshop.org), which makes the case that what we typically think of as rural America or &quot;real America&quot; is a mirage.
A piercing, unsentimental new book, &quot;The Lies of the Land&quot; (Chicago), by the historian Steven Conn, takes the long view. Wistful talk of &quot;real America&quot; aside, Conn, who teaches at Miami University, in Oxford, Ohio, argues that the rural United States is, in fact, highly artificial. Its inhabitants are as much creatures of state power and industrial capitalism as their city-dwelling counterparts. But we rarely acknowledge this, Conn writes, because many of us — urban and rural, on the left and the right — &quot;don&#x27;t quite want it to be true.…</p>

Therefore, we will award government-backed monopolies – patents – to pharma companies so they will have an incentive to invest their shareholders&#x27; capital in research. There&#x27;s plenty wrong with this argument. …</p>

                  <p>One of the best uses of technology is to make people laugh. In this three-part series, the Numerical YouTube channels uses some simple editing to increase the size of the goal until some laughably off-the-mark strikes by professional footballers Ousmane Dembélé, Harry Kane (his penalty miss vs France), and Nicolas Jackson finally find their targets. The misses just get more and more funny as the goal gets bigger.

                  <p>One of my recent favorite YouTube channels is James Payne&#x27;s Great Art Explained, which does exactly what it says on the tin, showcasing works of art like Starry Night, the Great Wave, and A Sunday on La Grande Jatte. Payne recently launched a new channel in the same vein: Great Books Explained. Here&#x27;s a trailer, featuring a short clip of his exploration of Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland.

Being an avid reader, I always wanted to do a book channel as well, but did not have the time, so these films are collaborations with different writers who are passionate about certain books, and the first release will be James Joyce&#x27;s Ulysses (in this case co-created with Henry Mountford). This will be followed by Alice.


The video on James Joyce&#x27;s Ulysses is out now:

The optic nerves of a rodent by Hassanain Qambari &amp; Jayden Dickson.
A heart shape is visible amongst breast cancer cells shot by Malgorzata Lisowska.



Sunflower pollen on an acupuncture needle by John-Oliver Dum.

And I love a good slime mold photo too. (via ars technica)

                  <p>At their recent creativity conference, Adobe showed off Project Primrose, in the form of a dress that changes colors and patterns at the click of a button. The garment could also display animations, including ones that respond to the wearer&#x27;s movements. From The Kid Should See This:
Created with small scales or petals that are programmed with Adobe software, the futuristic &#x27;fabric&#x27; can be used for clothing, handbags, curtains, furniture, and endless other surfaces.
Research Scientist Christine Dierk and her team designed and programmed everything about it. Dierk also stitched it together.

                  <p>From illustrator Pablo Carlos Budassi, this is a circular map of the universe.
The solar system is located in the center. Towards the edges, the scale is progressively reduced to show in detail the most distant and biggest structures of the observable universe sphere.


There are several other representations of the universe on Budassi&#x27;s site, including links to prints, posters, and other products.

                  <p>This is a heck of a time capsule: back in 2011, Chris Floyd photographed 140 people that he followed on Twitter over the course of a year and made a video featuring their portraits and audio of them &quot;talking about Twitter and it&#x27;s effect on the way we communicate and form relationships in the modern era&quot;. It&#x27;s almost quaint hearing people talk about the site in the time before Gamergate, 4chan, and other factors helped twist it into a very different place.

You can check out more of Floyd&#x27;s photographs and people&#x27;s stories on the One Hundred &amp; Forty Characters blog. (via noah kalina)

                  <p>A.V. Club has taken on the task of ranking the best 50 music videos, from the first video ever played on MTV (Video Killed the Radio Star by The Buggles, featuring none other than soundtrack composer Hans Zimmer on keys) to Thriller, Sabotage, Addicted to Love, and Sledgehammer. You can watch the whole list via this playlist on YouTube.

I loved the video for Sledgehammer. I was 12 years old the summer it came out. We didn&#x27;t have cable TV then, but I&#x27;d turn on MTV anywhere I could, hoping for a glimpse of it. My dad used to take my sister and me on roadtrips all over the country and I vividly remember the rare times we got to stay in a motel (they had to have a swimming pool with a diving board), turning on MTV, and catching that Sledgehammer video a few times every hour. It was only years later, after becoming a Wallace and Gromit fan, that I learned that — of course! — Aardman had done the animation for Sledgehammer.

                  <p>This is great and I loved it to bits: a 15-minute video from the Life Where I&#x27;m From YouTube channel about a tiny izakaya (13 seats!) in Tokyo owned and operated by a woman called &quot;Mama&quot; by her regulars.
When Mama is busy, regulars at this izakaya will serve themselves, get their own beers, get their &quot;bottle-keep&quot; and make their own drinks. They&#x27;ll also help out Mama-san by serving other customers as well. [...] Bottle keep is when a customer buys a bottle and the shop holds on to it for them. Then the next time they visit they can drink from that bottle again.


I&#x27;ve got lots of thoughts about this and connections to make! The izakaya&#x27;s casual help-yourself atmosphere reminded me of a post I made here more than 20 years ago called Business Lessons From the Donut and Coffee Guy.

                  <p>Name Sans is a typeface based on the tile mosaic lettering found in NYC subway stations.
The architects and craftworkers who designed &amp; laid these tiles used a letter construction that was part geometric and part grotesque, with typographic optical corrections often either exaggerated or totally missing. Name Sans interprets these ideas into an extensive type system that is at once anonymous and full of personality, useful for everything from branding to wayfinding to digital interfaces.


Lovely. I like this a lot.

                  <p>For the past few months, I&#x27;ve been working on a new commenting system for kottke.org and today I&#x27;m launching it in beta. If you&#x27;re a kottke.org member, you can try it out by heading to the comment section of this very post. (More on this in a bit but: comments are public but only members can post them.) I wrote up some community guidelines; I&#x27;d appreciate you reading them before participating.
So why comments? And why now? Blog comments have been long since left for dead, a victim of spam, social media, toxicity, and neglect. But there are still plenty of sites out there with thriving communities. My particular favorite is Cup of Jo, which has some of the best comment threads on the web:
They are always good, often great, and occasionally sublime. Years and even decades after most websites…</p>

                  <p>I loved this letter in the recent Metropolitan Diary from the NY Times (gift link). It begins:
My friend Tom runs a popular whale watch cruise out of Sheepshead Bay. Recently, an avid whale watcher and good friend, Buddy, died. One of Buddy&#x27;s wishes was that Tom spread his ashes on the ocean he loved so much.
So, on a beautiful summer evening, Tom canceled his usual nightly cruise and organized a private memorial service. More than 80 of Buddy&#x27;s friends and family members came to say a last goodbye.
A serious-looking young woman who sat quietly by herself was among the passengers. None of the other people, including the crew members, knew who she was.


I won&#x27;t spoil the ending...you&#x27;ll have to click through to read.
I&#x27;ve never been to any memorial services at sea, but I did go whale watching in Alaska once. The extremely salty captain of the boat had two prosthetic hands with hooks on them (as Tom Nash demonstrates in this video). After we got underway, he left his first mate in charge and came out on the windy deck, got a cigarette and a matchbook out of his shirt pocket, tore off a match, and, with a single try, lit the cigarette. In, like, whipping 20 mph winds with the boat heaving in the waves. He was standing right in front of me when as he did it and it remains one of the most physically impressive things I have ever seen a person do. The man was so perfectly in his element that it was almost magical.</p>

There is an entire little universe of people using Patreon to be funded to do good works in the world. These may be open source contributors. They may be activists. They may be journalists or bloggers. They do not make things that they exchange for money with the people who pledge them on Patreon.
Their patrons do not pay these creators to give things to them. Their patrons pay these creators to give things to the world: to release code for anyone to use, to engage in activism that changes the world for the better, or to write things that anyone can read.
I&#x27;m one of them. The number one reason I signed up for Patreon as my funding platform nin…</p>

                  <p>This is a great overview and review by Teri Kanefield of Heather Cox Richardson&#x27;s new book, Democracy Awakening.
She opens with: &quot;America is at a crossroads.&quot; 
But crossroads aren&#x27;t new. We&#x27;ve been at them before.
She shows how this moment is part of an ongoing struggle between a small group of white people who think that America was founded on principles of white supremacy and should remain that way, and the rest of us.


Throughout US history, the white supremacists have seized power and implemented minority rule: secession, Jim Crow &amp; anti-immigration laws. Then the majority pushes back: the Civil War &amp; Reconstruction, The New Deal.
The current GOP is a backlash against Brown v Board of Education (the Supreme Court case that declared racial segregation in schools unconstitutional.)
Richardson traces in detail how that backlash happened, and how today&#x27;s backlash echoes the language and attitudes of the Confederacy.
She shows Nixon and others tied taxes to &quot;redistributing wealth&quot; to &quot;undeserving&quot; people as a way to get lower income racists aboard an economic agenda that hurt them.


I really have to make time to read this book!

                  <p>Last month we got a glimpse of the newest season of the Apple+ series For All Mankind (&quot;Imagine a world where the global space race never ended.&quot;) in the form of a teaser trailer that did not give a whole lot away. Well, a proper trailer has dropped and it looks like the gang will be colonizing Mars and harvesting precious metals from asteroids. as I wrote last month:
Is it just me or, if you tilt your head and squint, can you see For All Mankind as a prequel/origin story for The Expanse?


It is maybe too much to ask of a prestige drama these days, but it would be cool to see the birth &amp; development of a Belter-like language a la the beginnings of an Antarctic accent.

                  <p>How do I navigate grief and hopelessness after a tragedy? How can I get through my grief and sadness? Sitting with grief can feel like we&#x27;re frozen in shock or being pulled between heavy feelings and numbness. In this calming visualization, Headspace Meditation and Mindfulness Teacher Dora Kamau teaches us that grief is non-linear and how to practice self-compassion throughout each phase of grief. We&#x27;ll learn ways to be present with our grief or intense sadness so that we can allow our emotions to move through us instead of feeling stuck.

                  <p>Over 130 animators, actors, filmmakers, and even puppeteers joined forces to remake a 1994 episode of the TV show Frasier called My Coffee With Niles. The episode was split into 185 sections, each 6-12 seconds long, and a different animator or filmmaker took charge of each section. Love this...just an incredible array of styles on display here.

I was hoping it would be eligible for one of the exhibits or just get into Night Games. IndieCade announced that Night Games would be an in person event, making that the first since the pandemic hit.

                  <p>I ran across this Slate piece by George Saunders yesterday and thought it was worth reposting. (Content warning: this article lists many violent acts, none of which are performed.)
At precisely 9 in the morning, working with focus and stealth, our entire membership succeeded in simultaneously beheading no one. At 10, Phase II began, during which our entire membership did not force a single man to suck another man&#x27;s penis. Also, none of us blew himself/herself up in a crowded public place. No civilians were literally turned inside out via our powerful explosives. In addition, at 11, in Phase III, zero (0) planes were flown into buildings.
During Phase IV, just after lunch, we were able to avoid bulldozing a single home. Furthermore, we set, on roads in every city, in every nation in the world, a total of zero (0) roadside bombs which, not being there, did not subsequently explode, killing/maiming a total of nobody. No bombs were dropped, during the lazy afternoon hours, on crowded civilian neighborhoods, from which, it was observed, no post-bomb momentary silences were then heard. These silences were, in all cases, followed by no unimaginable, grief-stricken bellows of rage, and/or frantic imprecations to a deity. No sleeping baby was awakened from an afternoon nap by the sudden collapse and/or bursting into flame of his/her domicile during Phase IV.


It&#x27;s a timely reminder of the overwhelming huge number of people in the world who are not militant extremists — but also of the power held by the tiny minority that are.

                  <p>Hey all. I&#x27;m going to be launching a new thing here soon (more on that in a few days), but you may have already noticed some changes around here. Design tweaks mostly. What you don&#x27;t see is that I pretty much ripped out the main guts of the site and rewrote a key piece of it...painful but necessary for some upcoming features. Hooooopefully it&#x27;s all working properly, but let me know if you see anything amiss? Especially with the membership stuff?
Anyway, one of the changes that people using RSS/newsreaders to read the site will have noticed is that the Quick Links are no longer bundled up into a few digests/day...they now arrive as they&#x27;re posted, one at a time. So if you got a bunch of old Quick Links clogging up your feedreader this morning, sorry about that — it should be a one-time thing.
Also regarding the RSS feed: the QL RSS items do not have titles (they are optional IIRC) and I&#x27;m getting a glimpse of the ways in which various newsreaders, uh, deal with title-less items. 😬 I&#x27;ve tested Feedly and Feedbin, but if you use another newsreader, would you mind emailing me a screenshot of how it handles these title-less Quick Links? Thanks!
Update: Ok, I&#x27;ve got FreshRSS, Newsblur, Unread, Reeder, NetNewsWire, Newsify, Newsboat, Inoreader, The Old Reader, Tiny Tiny RSS, Vienna, and a few others. I think I&#x27;m all set, thank you!

                  <p>You may have previously read about the Citicorp Center. Joe Morgenstern wrote about the Manhattan skyscraper in a classic New Yorker piece from 1995. The building was built incorrectly and might have blown over in a stiff wind if not for a timely intervention on the part of a mystery architecture student and the head structural engineer on the project.
Tells about designer William J. LeMessurier, who was structural consultant to the architect Hugh Stubbins, Jr. They set their 59-story tower on four massive nine-story-high stilts and used an unusual, chevron-shaped system of wind braces. LeMessurier had established the strength of those braces in perpendicular winds. Now, in the spirit of intellectual play, in his Harvard class, he wanted to see if they were just as strong in winds hitting from 45 degrees. He discovered the design flaw and during wind tunnel tests in Ontario learned the weakest joint was at the building&#x27;s 30th floor.

	
The whole piece is here and well worth a read. Last month, the excellent 99% Invisible did a radio show about Citicorp Center and added a new bit of information to the story: the identity of the mystery student who prodded LeMessurier to think more deeply about the structural integrity of his building. (via @bdeskin, who apparently factchecked Morgenstern&#x27;s piece back in the day)

                  <p>You have likely heard Yo-Yo Ma play his most famous piece before. Maybe even dozens of times. But Ma&#x27;s rendition of Bach&#x27;s Cello Suite No. 1 takes on a whole new dimension when accompanied by a babbling brook and bird calls in the forests of the Great Smoky Mountains. A lovely moment of peace in a world that could really use some right now.

                  <p>Nothing is faster than the speed of light. But compared to the unimaginable size of the Universe, light is actually extremely slow. This video is 45 minutes long and during that time, a photon emitted from the Sun1 will only travel through a portion of our solar system.

In our terrestrial view of things, the speed of light seems incredibly fast. But as soon as you view it against the vast distances of the universe, it&#x27;s unfortunately very slow. This animation illustrates, in realtime, the journey of a photon of light emitted from the sun and traveling across a portion of the solar system.

	
It takes light more than 43 minutes to travel to Jupiter and even to travel the diameter of the Sun takes 4.6 seconds. (thx, andy)
To even fight its way out of the Sun is an incredible journey for a photon. The Sun is so dense that a photon generated at the core is absorbed and re-emitted trillions of times by hydrogen nuclei on its way out. By some estimates, it may take up to 40,000 years for a photon to escape the Sun&#x27;s surface and head on out to the cold reaches of space.↩

                  <p>Photographer Reuben Wu was commissioned by Apple to take some of his wonderful light-painted photos with Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max in a project called The Inner Landscape.
So proud to be one of the first photographers to reveal a new series of images captured on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and celebrate its launch. &quot;The Inner Landscape&quot; is a series of six unearthly places that feel more intimate than epic, more ambiguous than explicit, making up a body of work that feels cohesive through its sense of connection and psychological space.


I love Wu&#x27;s work. More information about this project can be found at Colossal, Petapixel, and on Wu&#x27;s Instagram.

                  <p>Amazon has a bunch of stuff on sale today &amp; tomorrow for an &quot;event&quot; they&#x27;re calling Prime Big Deal Days. I&#x27;m not going to do a big roundup here, but here are a few things you might be interested in if you&#x27;re an Amazon shopper:
Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Gen) with Lightning connector for $189 (24% off). This is the lowest price I&#x27;ve seen on these; they&#x27;re the best headphones I&#x27;ve ever owned. Apple just released a newer version of these (nearly the same product except for a USB-C connector on the case) and the low price is probably to clear out inventory. Both versions charge just fine with a MagSafe or Qi-certified charger, so why not get the cheaper one if you charge that way and don&#x27;t care about the small differences? Update: Both versions are the same price (I don&#x27;t think they were this morning). So get the newer ones!
Apple 2020 MacBook Air Laptop M1 for $750 (25% off). This is my laptop. I love this laptop. When my daughter needed a new computer for high school, I bought her one of these.



Amazon Kindle Paperwhite for $95 (32% off). I read all my books on this. Lightweight and the battery lasts forever. And it charges with USB-3 so that&#x27;s one less cable to haul around.



SAF Aranet4 Home CO2 Monitor for $159 (36% off). This is everyone&#x27;s pick for the best indoor air quality monitor.



Splendor Board Game for $20.49 (54% off). This has been a recent hit around our house...very easy to play but still difficult to master.



KitchenAid 3.5 Qt. Stand Mixer for $260 (32% off). This is KitchenAid&#x27;s smaller stand mixer, which is lighter and takes up less counter space in smaller kitchens.

You can find more deals on the Prime Big Deal Days page.

                  <p>Planet Earth III will begin airing later this year on BBC and, presumably, at some later time in the US. The latest installment in the legendary series, 17 years after the first one was released, will once again be presented by Sir David Attenborough, now 97 years old and still as enthusiastic about sharing the wonders of nature as he ever was.
&#x27;The opening of the series with David was filmed in the beautiful British countryside in exactly the location where Charles Darwin used to walk whilst thinking-over his Earth-shaking ideas about evolution. It seemed the perfect place for David to introduce Planet Earth III and remind us of both the wonders and the fragility of our planet. ....and for him, of course, the sun shined under blue skies one of the only days it did all summer!.&#x27;


The video above is a quick first look at the series and here&#x27;s a trailer as well:

Looking forward to this...the Planet Earth series is still the gold standard for nature documentaries.

                  <p>Specifically the [space] [slash] combo before the closing bracket:  /.
I&#x27;ve had history with these particular two characters, but until recently that history of going back and forth was entirely based on aesthetic.
Then React came along (or rather I climbed aboard) and I found myself always adding the trailing slash to elements, regardless of whether I was writing React or plain old HTML.
Then today, I got bit in the arse by a self closing tag and it reminds me of Jake&#x27;s very recent post on the exact same thing.</p>

                  <p>Cutting to the chase: text editors *and* tabs vs. spaces!  Ooooh!


I&#x27;ve had this thing called &quot;e&quot; for a while now.  It&#x27;s a stupid little 
script which serves to do a couple of things.  It starts my 
editor
with a given file, and it kicks it with the right arguments to make it 
disable line wrapping and to make the [TAB] key actually put in two 
spaces.


So, my dumb script would use &quot;-w -E -T 2&quot; most of the time, except when it 
was running on a Makefile, at which point it would skip those args.  
Simple enough, right?


pico is back?  Yes indeed, on Macs, as of 12.3, pico is in fact back.  To 
make sure I wasn&#x27;t imagining things, I tracked down a machine that hadn&#x27;t 
been upgraded yet and checked there.  Sure enough, it was in fact nano and 
not pico.


macOS 12.3 has nano as a symlink... pointing to pico!


At some point, I switched from literal tab characters in my source code to 
blobs of spaces, probably due to using that style at work and not hating 
it.  So, somewhere along the line I actually started depending on nano 
behavior without realizing it.


As for the lack of a feature in pico itself, it&#x27;s kind of strange, really.  
If you go digging into the source, they have this random.c with a function 
called tab which claims to &quot;simulate tab stop&quot; using spaces.  That said, I 
can&#x27;t find any place where it would be called with the magic values which 
would make it behave that way.


It wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if this switch is just more of Apple removing 
GPLed things from their OS - pico seems to use the Apache license.  They 
dumped bash for zsh (MIT license) at some point (Big Sur, I think), and 
now this?  Okay then.</p>

                  <p>Here&#x27;s a very old and stupid trick you could do with some filesystems in 
some situations back in the day... and might still be able to do in a 
few places today.


The problem is that while version X might eventually have an exploit, 
it&#x27;ll get removed and it&#x27;ll be replaced by version Y without that
particular hole.  By the time you get your hands on a tool to break into 
X, it&#x27;ll be gone.


What you&#x27;d do is create a hard link pointing at the file you wanted to 
preserve, storing it in a spot which was writable by your account.  
Then, say, /usr/bin/sudo (because that never has security 
issues...) gets replaced at some point with a new file and you get to 
keep the old version.  When you get the tool to pop it, off you go!


Of course, these days, it&#x27;s not quite so easy on the more modern systems 
you find.  Debian 11 here won&#x27;t let me do it - it&#x27;s EPERM city.  Rocky 8 
(so CentOS 8 and RHEL 8 too) also won&#x27;t do it.  They both have some gunk
in /usr/lib/sysctl.d to lock this down.  But, my old Slackware 14.2 
install of my workstation let me do it the last time I tried about 
a year ago.  How about that, huh?  I bet it&#x27;d still work if I dug out 
the old drives and booted them up.


Incidentally, this is the magic sauce: /proc/sys/fs/protected_hardlinks
Read the man page for proc(5) to learn more about it.

here it is,
the thread I read a long time ago.  It&#x27;s interesting to note that as far 
as I can tell, nothing actually changed upstream.  This left paranoid 
admins like me with no option but to use the (most excellent) Openwall 
patches to lock down this kind of stuff.  I used that on my machines at 
work which had non-staff users... just in case.


This whole situation is scary.

                  <p>Back in January, you might have seen my
post
about a very large BBS which seemed to solve for the problem of &quot;how do 
we host a bunch of users&quot; by having one physical box per user.  It might 
have been one physical box per *two* users, maybe, but it&#x27;s hard to say.


Now, keep in mind digital cameras weren&#x27;t easy to come by, so I have 
very few actual pictures.  I&#x27;ll have to do a lot of explaining to make 
up for the lack of detail and alternate angles.  Clearly, I had no

Some friends at a local company had some bandwidth to spare (a T1 to 
Alternet somewhere, as I recall), so they parked a Zoom modem on one of 
their boxes and plugged it into a phone line.  We got an identical model

save them in case conditions change or other things happen and make me 
want to follow up on the topic.  In this case, I wrote something about 
offices before the whole COVID lockdown thing happened and people 
largely stopped going to offices every day.  With that in mind, let&#x27;s 
proceed.


However, tech companies decided to go past this at some point and 
brought about this whole notion of &quot;microkitchens&quot;.  This is where 
they&#x27;d put their branding on the coolers (instead of &quot;Coca-Cola&quot; or 
&quot;Pepsi&quot;) and would load it up with every kind of fizzy sugary liquid

                  <p>One of the fun things I used to do at a prior job was to dig through the 
raw data points which were collected from the *many* servers we had.  I 
could just pick an interesting-sounding metric and then would just ask 
the system to show me the top 10 or bottom 10 out of a population of 
thousands or more.


To get my feet wet with the whole &quot;investigations&quot; thing that we&#x27;d do, I 
started looking into this one day and chose one of the many temp sensors 
which were being logged by the servers.  I forget exactly which one it 
was, for there were many.  The CPUs logged it, the chassis logged it, 
the power supply logged it, and so on.  There were so many choices.


I went looking for a reason.  What could possibly explain this?  First 
off, it didn&#x27;t line up with any obvious pattern in the host names.  The 
hosts were named for whichever team owned them, followed by a sequence 
number that was bumped any time a new one was provisioned.  There was no 
signal to be found in that.


There was more, though.  You could also see a &quot;rack position&quot; in this 
data, and now it started getting interesting.  It seems that all of the 
really hot machines had a rack position of something low, like 04 or 05, 
and never anything higher than that.  In fact, when looking at a whole 
rack, it was always the lowest number of all of the positions that were 
being used.  Now this was worth chasing!


It&#x27;s good that I asked, since they told me something surprising: 
position 04 or 05 or whatever was the *bottom* of the rack.  Yes, 
somehow, the lowest machine in the rack was the hottest!  They found 
this interesting, too, and wound up digging into it.  Given that I was 
far away in a distant office, this was the best way for us to proceed.


The problem was that the bottommost server would have nothing below it 
but just open space until it got to the floor.  That space would not 
move air efficiently, and it obviously mattered.


This rolled out and my hot spots disappeared.  Fantastic!</p>

wish I didn&#x27;t have to write about.

wrote
about seeing a maintenance truck rolling down the Caltrain line in 
Mountain View.  It had a special attachment to let it stay on the rails.  
At no point did the arms come down for the crossing.  It managed to 
approach, then the people inside looked around and went through, and the 
arms never budged.  There were no flashing lights or bells.




caught fire.  A bunch of people were hurt.  More were shaken 
up.


I&#x27;m assuming their construction trucks don&#x27;t trigger the &quot;short the 
rails together to signal various things&quot; logic, either.  This would 
mean that crossing arms stay up... and I have to assume it also means 
the signals along the way stay green instead of going red.

We will presumably hear more about whatever the signals said, and 
whether the train went past a red signal or not.  I just have a bad 
feeling that they saw a green and kept on going.</p>

                  <p>Here&#x27;s a little bit of Silicon Valley local flavor for a change.  We 
have this freeway that runs from San Jose to San Francisco called US 
101, or around here, just &quot;101&quot;.  (Southern California has it too, but 
they call it &quot;the&quot; 101.  That&#x27;s how we detect invaders.)  Anyway, this 
thing is usually eight or more lanes up and down the peninsula, and it&#x27;s 
had a &quot;diamond&quot; or car pool lane on the #1 (innermost/&quot;fast&quot;) lane for 
many years.  You had to have a certain number of people in the car (or 
some other conditions met) during certain hours (AM and PM rush, 
weekdays), or you&#x27;d be in for a hefty ticket.


How does the system know what to charge you?  Well, you either have an 
old-style toll transponder that always bills you as a solo driver, or 
you have a new-style transponder with a 1/2/3+ switch that tells the 
road how to handle you.


Think about what this does to enforcement.  Now, instead of just &quot;is 
there a vehicle in the lane&quot;, &quot;is it the right time during a weekday&quot;, 
and &quot;how many people are in the car&quot;, now it&#x27;s also a matter of &quot;do they 
have their transponder set properly&quot;.

                  <p>I already told a
story
about how you can hose your machine by pointing the Linux kernel at a 
custom core dump handler and then have that handler fail to function.  
This&#x27;ll clog up the pipe (really), and then everything else will just 
stack up behind it.  Pretty soon, every crashing process will be stuck 
just the same.


Once upon a time, in a big company environment, someone decided that 
they wanted to provide a service to other things running on the same 
Linux box.  But, instead of either writing Yet Another Service (tm) 
that would go through release processes and all of that good stuff, they 
went for a different design entirely.


There are so many problems with this.  You have the issue of a &quot;server&quot;

                  <p>If a web site makes an RSS or Atom feed available, it&#x27;s not a bad idea 
to poll it from time to time.  Actually doing that poll like a good 
netizen (remember that concept?) takes a little attention to detail.


Given the reality of the situation, does it make sense to poll every 10 
seconds?  Probably not, right?  Someone set up something like that and 
left it running for a couple of months until I finally noticed it and 
dealt with it myself.


Given this, you can keep track of the &quot;Last-Modified&quot; header when you 
get a copy of the feed.  Then, you can turn around and use that same 
value in an &quot;If-Modified-Since&quot; header the next time you come to look 
for an update.  If nothing&#x27;s changed, the web server will notice it&#x27;s 
the same as what it already has, and it&#x27;ll send you a HTTP 304 co…</p>

                  <p>Here&#x27;s a concept: &quot;ssh to prod and edit directly on the machine&quot; is 
generally bad news.


I should point out that I didn&#x27;t know this person and had no idea how 
they would respond to such feedback - it might have been fine!  They 
might be a well-adjusted person who can take a request like that and not 
turn it around into a full-on nuclear attack.  But, I didn&#x27;t know either 
way.


At some point, I actually had a meeting with this developer for some 
other reason, and what happened was kind of amazing.  First thing, he 
brought it up and asked me about it.  I said something like, &quot;well, I 
didn&#x27;t want to get into it, but since you asked&quot;, and proceeded into 
something along the lines of &quot;obviously it would be best if you didn&#x27;t 
do that - sshing in and twiddling Python files on the actual production 
AWS instance of the service&quot;.


&quot;But... I suspect you are doing it for some reason?&quot;


My response was... I hope... reasonable: &quot;So as much as I would love to 
say &#x27;don&#x27;t do that!!!&#x27;, I&#x27;m not going to stand in the way of you 
literally doing your job.  So please proceed with care, and keep an eye 
open for some day when (first dumb thing) and (second dumb thing) aren&#x27;t 
problems any more and you need not do this any more.&quot;


It was either &quot;edit in prod&quot; or endure DAY LONG development cycles: make 
a change, wait 24 hours, come back tomorrow, and try it again.  That&#x27;s 
how broken it was.


The best part about this was that we had a totally reasonable 
conversation about it.  It&#x27;s the kind of thing which had become a rare 
commodity in those days at that place.


Would I expect someone else to go to that level of insanity every single 
time they just want to get their job done?  Absolutely not.

Editing files in prod to develop them?  That&#x27;s bad news.  Deliberately 
rigging tunnels to spoof a connection from prod?  That&#x27;s also bad news.  
Having to do them to get your job done?  You might be in the bad place.</p>

                  <p>Quite a while back, I wrote a post that basically went like this: if 
someone has a problem with someone else or something that person is 
doing, they&#x27;re going to find a way to get to &quot;no&quot;.  They will find some 
reason, some excuse, or some problem with it.  They&#x27;ll bring up a point 
and you&#x27;ll show that this is not in fact a thing.  They will then pivot 
again and again.


But, as I said, that was back then, and this time I&#x27;m talking about 
something else: when it happens in person with a coworker.  I had an 
experience like this a few years back, and figured I&#x27;d share how it goes 
for the sake of others who might not have encountered it yet, or who 
have and thought they were alone in this.

                  <p>This is a short one since it&#x27;s somewhere between a random bit of 
&quot;grab some popcorn&quot; amusement and a &quot;huh, that might be a problem some 
day&quot;.  In short, it looks like every Raspberry Pi filesystem installed 
from any given release image probably ends up with the same
UUID.


For instance, if you downloaded the &quot;lite&quot; version of Raspbian between 
roughly November 8th and January 28th, you probably got a file called 
2021-10-30-raspios-bullseye-armhf-lite.zip.  Inside, there&#x27;s an image, 
and the idea is that you dump that straight to your SD card, cram it in 
the Pi, and off you go.  The second partition on that image is an ext4 
filesystem which was created on some build machine somewhere.  The UUID 
on it never gets &quot;evolved&quot; to something else after the install.


You can see it inside the image itself here:


Or, if you actually installed a few of these things like I did over the 
past couple of months, you can just &#x27;tune2fs -l /dev/mmcblk0p2&#x27; and see 
the same value in there.


Don&#x27;t end up with a pile of SD cards on your desk and think &quot;I know, 
I&#x27;ll use the filesystem UUIDs to track which one goes where&quot;, in other 
words.


If it&#x27;s not breaking anything for you, it&#x27;s probably best to just let it 
be.  Untangling a boot mess on these weird little boxes is anything but 
fun.

Note: if you&#x27;re actually on a recent Raspberry Pi, odds are good that 
your /etc/fstab will be using *partition* UUIDs (PARTUUID&#x3D;...) and not 
those of the filesystem.  If in doubt, use blkid to see what&#x27;s what.</p>

                  <p>A reader wrote in asking what I thought about the whole GitHub &quot;copilot&quot; 
thing.  If you haven&#x27;t heard of it yet, it&#x27;s apparently this thing that 
was trained on a whole mess of repositories and their code, and you can 
&quot;prompt&quot; it and it&#x27;ll spit out code that may or may not do what you 
want.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to know about licensing (BSD, GPL, MIT, that sort 
of thing), or plagiarism, or any of that other good stuff.


This is actually a story about somewhere I used to work, and someone who 
was on one of my teams back in the day.  One day, I heard that one of 
the people in a far-away office had created some kind of tool that would 
let you look at the status of different machines - that is, Linux boxes. 
I don&#x27;t remember the finer points of it or why this person even 
bothered, but they…</p>

                  <p>There are some interesting implications to the way that you have to 
handle references to other bits of code when you write a C++ header 
file.  There are things you can do which turn out to be suboptimal, and 
until or unless you work someplace with a coding style document or get 
some mentor who&#x27;s already been there, you&#x27;re likely to make some
mistakes.


Anyway, a common way to do this is to set up the outer class such that 
it has a pointer to the inner one.  You *could* have it just own it 
directly, but then that introduces problems.

  Bar bar_;



Of course, bar.h probably has its own dependencies which get #included, 
and so now you end up with this evil web of slow compiles.  It sucks.


What used to happen next is that someone would say, okay, let&#x27;s make it

                  <p>Yesterday, I
put forth
a bunch of API possibilities for the problem of needing to return a 
value but also indicating the lack of a value and being able to comment 
on why.  In it, the notion of a &quot;wrapper&quot; around a string was presented, 
such that it might look like &quot;Result&quot;, and those brackets 
started looking like a pain.  There was also the possibility of having 
something like &quot;ResultString&quot;, but didn&#x27;t that open the door to having a 
bunch of code duplication?


After this had existed for a while, the general happy feeling of having 
this stuff in place became infectious.  I wanted it to cover other 
things with it, too.  I wanted it to handle something a bit more 
complicated than a mere string, and so decided to try my hand at the 
template-wrangling metaprogramming cruft t…</p>

                  <p>If you agree with the notion that you need to be able to tell the 
difference between the absence of a value and a value itself, then this 
has some impacts on the code you write.  If you want to keep &#x27;em 
separated (so they can come out and play), then it gets you looking at 
your API designs in certain ways.


Imagine we&#x27;re talking about a helper function that is intended to be run 
inside a program that&#x27;s handling the access to a web page.  It&#x27;s 
probably a CGI program, but it could also be buried inside some much 
bigger thing, too.  This is all about C++ styles, but you can probably 
see slices of other languages in here, too.

yesterday&#x27;s post,
I mentioned taking my old Mac Mini out of the OS X/macos ecosystem and 
bringing it into Debian, and then what kind of hilarity followed when I 
attempted to install a Javascript linter (and it tried to drag in 180+ 
node-related packages).

here.


First of all, the one that most people actually notice is the actual box 
which is serving rachelbythebay.com, which at the moment is a box called

do they ever really think about the implications of having hundreds of 
teeny little libraries, all moving independently?  This is how it 
manifests in the real world.


My relative inexperience with Debian systems means I&#x27;m constantly being 
delighted to discover that such and such has already been packaged up 
and is just an apt command away.  Things that I would have done by hand 
in the years up to this point now have someone else worrying about them.


This is what happened next:

Go and gRPC, apparently!


I found this while searching the web for &quot;1213486160&quot; to see how things 
have been going in the past few years.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s still biting 
people all over the place.  There are far too many posts asking people 
to upgrade their software, or restart things, or do any number of 
useless rubber-chicken-waving techniques which ultimately will 
accomplish nothing.

When you see a funny-looking number, figure out where it comes from.
That&#x27;s the only way to have any chance of understanding what&#x27;s actually 
going on.</p>

&quot;process infection&quot; story:

https://lwn.net/Articles/883547/):


If you do privileged execution of specific operations via IPC you get 
the guarantee that whatever is done, is done from a well-defined, 
pristine execution environment, without leaking context implicitly. The 
IPC message is the *full* vulnerable surface, and that&#x27;s as minimal as 
it can get. And that&#x27;s great.




Oh wow, thank you for mentioning that, unnamed reader!  I definitely 
read that post on LWN at some point in the past couple of days when the 
pkexec thing started going around.  It must have really worked its way 
into my head, and then eventually stirred up the memory of everything 
getting &quot;nicely infected&quot; at $OLD_JOB.

                  <p>I once worked at a place that had an interesting little problem stemming 
from the way they managed machines and some of the fun side-effects 
processes can have on each other.  This is back in the pre-systemd days 
of running services, such that things tended to be started or restarted 
by someone or something that itself ran as root.  That is, if you 
started something, it might inherit one or more things from your 
environment.  Likewise, if you ran something with an unusual 
environment, it might bestow those &quot;gifts&quot; onto anything it happened to 
touch.


After locking themselves out of machines too many times, people 
generally learned that after you mess with a glibc upgrade, you restart 
the sshd listener on port 22.  Of course, they also had to learn to not

in a post all by itself to give it a chance to &quot;sink in&quot; before I went 
and used it in an analogy.  First, I&#x27;ll just show the image and explain 
what you&#x27;re looking at here.




I do remember the description from the back: this is a picture of *part 
of* something that was called the Software Creations BBS.  It was a 
multi-line bulletin board system where you could dial up and send 
messages to people, upload and download files, and (presumably) play 
online games (&quot;doors&quot;) and anything else they cared to offer.

64 machines in a little space.  I have to assume 
they are at least 
286s (ATs, more or 
less), but it&#x27;s impossible to tell from just this picture.  They could 
have been 386s or even 486s by that point, but …</p>

                  <p>Okay, so yesterday I 
posted
a picture of an old multi-line bulletin board system which had 
apparently taken over an entire bedroom with dozens of computers.  I 
mentioned that I intended to come back to the topic to throw in my own 
two cents, and so here we go.


Or, were you someone who found it horrific and wished there was a 
simpler way?  Did you wonder if it would be possible to pack all of that 
into one or maybe two boxes, instead?  Did you want a way to negate all 
of that complexity while still providing the same level of service?


Now, things are different.  I look at that and just sigh at the lost 
opportunities.  The actual amount of work being done on behalf of any of 
the users who are connected is tiny.  If we ignore the fact that the
