                <p>Container Queries (CQ) allow us to change the styles of a component so it responds to the size of its nearest container. With CQ, we can change how an element looks based on where on a page it is placed and how much horizontal space it occupies.
A lot about a design pattern could change based on how much space it&rsquo;s got. So Container Queries can be used to do more than just shift elements around in a layout. (Have you seen Jhey&rsquo;s demo yet?!) But we can only take full advantage of the potential Co‚Ä¶</p>

The only (big) problem I run into is that the solution offered is to use &quot;docker secrets&quot; which, for the vast majority of my own work isn't something that's available (I don't use docker for my development or deployments).
It makes me wonder, is there a simple alternative for those non-docker devs ü§î

                <p>My short interpretation of Alex Russell's post (or certainly in my mind):


Apple have a monopoly


Safari, for over a decade now, been way way behind


Safari is not a modern browser - this is literally what devs and designers complained about IE6 for years.


Still, read Alex's post - it's packed full of data (as usual) and draws a clear conclusion that Apple, again, are delaying progress for the world wide web.

She was the one who taught me the importance of testers and how they are a critical gear in the machinery that makes up making a game.

                <p>Recently a squirrel noticed our nut box that was waiting to be raided for almost a year now. But as our squirrels here are a but skittish, I needed to come up with a way to get in close to take nice pictures of them.
