                  <p>In 1842, a French artist and scholar named Joseph-Philibert Girault de Prangey set out on a tour of the eastern Mediterranean to document sights and architecture via the brand new medium of photography. He started off in what is now Italy and continued on to Greece, Egypt, Turkey, Syria, and the Levant (which includes modern-day Lebanon, Israel, and Palestine). The daguerreotypes he took are the oldest surviving photos of those locations (aside from Italy). It&#x27;s incredible to time travel back 180 years to see what these places looked like. (via aeon)

                  <p>Vox talked to four television writers about how streaming and prestige TV have changed the financial picture for writers over the past 15 years, contributing to the writers strike that&#x27;s been going on since early May.
Companies like Netflix, Hulu, Apple TV+, and more have given consumers an unprecedented array of films and TV shows and opened the door to new voices that don&#x27;t have to adhere to mainstream network formats. On the other hand, streaming has also changed how television gets produced, the role writers play, and how they get paid. We interviewed four television writers and showrunners about how streaming has changed how they work, how their incomes have taken a hit, and why it has become harder than ever to build a career.

                  <p>I&#x27;m taken with the style of Jun Kumaori&#x27;s illustrations — they look like drawings of (stay with me here) small JPEGs converted to GIFs and then clumsily enlarged, complete with all of the resultant digital artifacts. This makes me nostalgic for the late 90s web and Photoshop 3.0. (via the fox is black)

                  <p>I just really love the hell out of these iterative Lego build videos from Brick Experiment Channel and Brick Technology. In this one, a car is repeatedly modified to roll perfectly on an increasingly inclined treadmill. I started watching and in 10 seconds I was 100% invested.
They&#x27;re not even really about Lego...that&#x27;s just the playful hook to get you through the door. They&#x27;re really about science and engineering — trial and error, repeated failure, iteration, small gains, switching tactics when confronted with dead ends, how innovation can result in significant advantages. Of course, none of this is unique to engineering; these are all factors in any creative endeavor — painting, sports, photography, writing, programming. But the real magic here is seeing it all happen in just a few minutes.

                  <p>Traditionally, the subjects depicted in Western art were either religious or rich — wealthy patrons paid for paintings of themselves or of their religions. As Evan Puschak explains in this brief video essay, that began to change in the 16th century as revolution, reformation, and the development of a merchant class shifted who was worthy of depiction and who could pay.

Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been watching, reading, listening to, and experiencing over the last two months.

Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. One of the most visually stunning movies I&#x27;ve ever seen. A worthy sequel to the first film. (A)
On Being with Krista Tippett: Isabel Wilkerson. I will take any opportunity to listen to Isabel Wilkerson talk about her work. (A)
Deep Space Archives. Been listening to this album by A.L.I.S.O.N on heavy rotation while working recently. (A-)
Parable of the Sower by Octavia Bulter. Bleak and powerful, science fiction at its finest. (A)

Asteroid City. I liked Wes Anderson&#x27;s latest effort quite a bit. …</p>

                  <p>Stephanie Shih is a Brooklyn-based ceramic artist who makes painted sculptures of ordinary objects like food, shoes, hats, and signs. A recent exhibition focused on the overlap of immigrant communities of Asians and Jews on NYC&#x27;s Lower East Side and Chinatown.
A few yards from where the Bernstein-on-Essex sign hangs is a long table that displays Shih&#x27;s sculpted takes on other iconic food and drink, like a bilingual bottle of Soy Vay Veri Veri Teriyaki, roast pork on garlic bread, Golden Plum Chinkiang Vinegar, and a can of Dr. Brown&#x27;s Cel-Ray Soda.
&quot;A lot of my solo shows are about this idea of authenticity,&quot; says Shih, who has been working in ceramic full-time since 2015. &quot;There are no cultures that are untouched by other cultures. These are two communities that grew up alongside each other. It was not always friendly, but simply from proximity and the fact that they were the two largest non-Christian immigrant groups, they had commonalities.&quot; For example, she says, the tradition of Jews eating Chinese food on Christmas began right near Harkawik, on the Lower East Side.


You can find much more of her work on Instagram.

Fun fact about me: I always have a rubber band or two on my wrist...I&#x27;ve been wearing them for no particular reason since I was 17. So this video is right up my alley. (via digg)

                  <p>When you apply power with higher-than-normal voltage to electric kids toys, they tend to move faster. When you apply 30V instead of the usual 2.5V or 5V, they move really fast:

This reminds me of when I was in grade school. Does anyone remember Stompers? They were battery-operated cars and trucks that were bigger than HotWheels and, while not remote-controlled, were able to move around under their own power. But they weren&#x27;t that speedy...maybe they could do 1-2 mph.
Anyway, some kid at school figured out that you could remove the AA battery, connect wires to the battery terminals, and then connect those wires to as many C- and D-cell batteries as you could gang together in a series. So instead of the usual 1.5V, you could pump 4.5V, 6V, 7.5V, or even 9V into those tiny cars. And boy, did they go. We could barely keep up as we raced them against each other down the halls, running behind them holding our battery packs. But the thrills were short-lived — I think the school banned them and all that current burned the tiny Stomper motors out after awhile. Fun while it lasted though! (via waxy)

                  <p>For the past 13 years, former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich has taught a class called Wealth &amp; Poverty at UC Berkeley. He retired from teaching this year and has uploaded his lectures from the course to YouTube. 
Welcome to my final UC Berkeley course on Wealth and Poverty. Drawing on my 40+ years in politics, including my time as secretary of labor, I offer a deeper look at why inequalities of income and wealth have widened significantly since the late 1970s in the United States, and why this poses dangerous risks to our society.
This course also offers insights into the political and public-policy debates that have arisen in light of this inequality, as well as possible means of reversing it.


Here&#x27;s the first lecture, What&#x27;s Happened to Income &amp; Wealth:

Reich has also published an abbreviated syllabus for each of the classes; links can be found in his course introduction (here&#x27;s class #1).

While the term &quot;pioneer&quot; is used loosely in pop culture today, few terms describe Cypress Hill&#x27;s impact over the past three decades more adequately. They are the first Latino hip-hop group to achieve platinum and multi-platinum status. B Real, Sen and producer DJ Muggs crafted a sound in the &#x27;90s that stretched beyond regional boundaries. It was dark, psychedelic and at times directly addressed mental health before the topic was commonplace. Many dismissed the group as &quot;stoner rappers,&quot; yet the members were fervent advocates for the legalization of weed long before it came to fruition.


Really enjoyed this one...I&#x27;m not a particular fan of Cypress Hill but after this, maybe I am?

                  <p>It&#x27;s always fun to see what the former President is planning on reading over the summer. Here&#x27;s his full list:
Poverty, by America by Matthew Desmond.
Small Mercies by Dennis Lehane.
King: A Life by Jonathan Eig.
Hello Beautiful by Ann Napolitano.
All the Sinners Bleed by S.A. Cosby.
Birnam Wood by Eleanor Catton.
What Napoleon Could Not Do by DK Nnuro.
The Wager by David Grann.
Blue Hour by Tiffany Clarke Harrison.


I&#x27;ve read The Wager (so good!) and have been wanting to dig into Matthew Desmond&#x27;s book but most of the rest of these are new to me.
Right now, I&#x27;m reading Hugh Howey&#x27;s Wool (after inhaling the first season of Silo) and American Prometheus (after seeing Oppenheimer last night) — I&#x27;m sensing a pattern here...

                  <p>WordPress has been with me since my very first post in 2009.
There is a lot to love about it: It’s open source, it has a thriving ecosystem, a beautiful default theme, and a revolutionary block editor that makes my inner UX geek giddy.
Plus, WP made building a website and publishing content accessible to everyone.
No wonder it’s the most popular CMS in the world, by a huge margin.
However, for me, the bad had started to outweigh the good:
Things I could do in minutes in a static site, in WP required finding a plugin or tweaking PHP code.
It was slow and bloated.
Getting a draft out of it and into another medium was a pain.
Despite having never been hacked, I was terrified about it, given all the horror stories.
I was periodically getting “Error establishing a database connection” errors, w…</p>

                  <p>Long-time readers will recall that I used to link to Flash games pretty regularly. They were typically easy to play and hard to put down — I collected them under the addictive Flash games tag. The collective time and energy spent by kottke.org readers playing these games over the years is, well, I don&#x27;t even want to take a guess. So, it is with regret for the rest of your workday that I pass along this site that contains playable versions of tens of thousands of Flash games, including many of the ones I&#x27;ve collected. Here are several that you might remember:
Cyclomaniacs
Fantastic Contraption 2



Hedgehog Launch



Desktop Tower Defense



Solipskier



Gimme Friction Baby



BridgeCraft



Idleplex



Axon



Wonderputt



Love



Alphabet Shoot



Bubble Tanks Tower Defense



Perfect Balance



Don&#x27;t Shoot the Puppy

Good luck with all that...I only escaped after an hour of poking around. 😬 (via waxy)

                  <p>François Vautier installed an ant colony in his scanner and scanned it each week for five years. This is the resulting time lapse video.
Five years ago, I installed an ant colony inside my old scanner that allowed me to scan in high definition this ever evolving microcosm (animal, vegetable and mineral). The resulting clip is a close-up examination of how these tiny beings live in this unique ant farm. I observed how decay and corrosion slowly but surely invaded the internal organs of the scanner. Nature gradually takes hold of this completely synthetic environment.

                  <p>54 years ago today, on July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong &amp; Buzz Aldrin landed on the Moon and went for a little walk. For the 15th year in a row, you can watch the original CBS News coverage of Walter Cronkite reporting on the Moon landing and the first Moon walk on a small B&amp;W television, synced to the present-day time. Just open this page in your browser today, July 20th, and the coverage will start playing at the proper time. Here&#x27;s the schedule (all times EDT):
4:10:30 pm: Moon landing broadcast starts
4:20:15 pm - 10:51:26 pm: Break in coverage
10:51:27 pm: Moon walk broadcast starts
Set an alarm on your phone or calendar! Also, this works best on an actual computer but I think it functions ok on phones and tablets if necessary.
Back in 2018, I wrote a bit about what to look out for when you&#x27;re watching the landing:
The radio voices you hear are mostly Mission Control in Houston (specifically Apollo astronaut Charlie Duke, who acted as the spacecraft communicator for this mission) and Buzz Aldrin, whose job during the landing was to keep an eye on the LM&#x27;s altitude and speed — you can hear him calling it out, &quot;3 1/2 down, 220 feet, 13 forward.&quot; Armstrong doesn&#x27;t say a whole lot...he&#x27;s busy flying and furiously searching for a suitable landing site. But it&#x27;s Armstrong that says after they land, &quot;Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.&quot;. Note the change in call sign from &quot;Eagle&quot; to &quot;Tranquility Base&quot;. :)
Two things to listen for on the broadcast: the 1201/1202 program alarms I mentioned above and two quick callouts by Charlie Duke about the remaining fuel towards the end: &quot;60 seconds&quot; and &quot;30 seconds&quot;. Armstrong is taking all this information in through his earpiece — the 1202s, the altitude and speed from Aldrin, and the remaining fuel — and using it to figure out where to land.

                  <p>After my post about Soap Bubble Worlds yesterday, several people sent me this video of the rainbow colors that can be seen on the surface of and in the steam above a swirling cup of hot water. I was expecting a straight-forward visual display accompanied by some relaxing music (and that version does exist) but it also includes a fascinating explanation of where all these colors and swirls come from.
Scientific investigations into beautiful phenomena always makes me think of physicist Richard Feynman&#x27;s thoughts on beauty:
I have a friend who is an artist, and has sometimes taken a view which I don&#x27;t agree with very well. He&#x27;ll hold up a flower and say &quot;Look how beautiful it is&quot; and I&#x27;ll agree. And he says, &quot;you see, as an artist I can see how beautiful this is, but you as a scientist take this all apart and it becomes a dull thing.&quot; And I think that he&#x27;s kind of nutty.
First of all, the beauty that he sees is available to other people, and to me too, I believe - although I may not be quite as refined aesthetically as he is, but I can appreciate the beauty of a flower. At the same time, I see much more about the flower than he sees. I could imagine the cells in there, the complicated actions, which also have a beauty. I mean, it&#x27;s not just beauty at this dimension of one centimeter, there&#x27;s also beauty at smaller dimensions. The inner structure, also the processes, the fact that the colors and the flower are evolved in order to attract insects to pollinate it is interesting. It means that insects can see the color.
It adds a question: Is this aesthetic sense also exist in the lower forms that... why is it aesthetic... all kinds of interesting questions which the science, knowledge, only adds to the excitement, and mystery, and the awe of a flower. It only adds. I don&#x27;t understand how it subtracts.

                  <p>This is the third spinoff post in the migration saga of this blog from WordPress to 11ty.
Migrating was a good opportunity to rethink the information architecture of my site,
especially around categorization.
Categories vs Tags
Just like most WP users, I was using both categories and tags, simply because they came for free.
However the difference between them was a bit fuzzy, as evidenced by how inconsistently they are used, both here and around the Web.
I was mainly using Categories for the type of article (Articles, Rants, Releases, Tips, Tutorials, News, Thoughts),
however there were also categories that were more like content tags (e.g. CSS WG, Original, Speaking, Benchmarks).
This was easily solved by moving the latter to actual tags.
However, tags are no panacea, there are several is…</p>

On good URLs
It was important to me to have good, RESTful, usable, hackable URLs.
While a lot of that is easy and comes for free, following this principle with Eleventy proved quite hard:
URLs that are “hackable” to allow users to move to higher levels of the information architecture by hacking off the end of the URL
What does this mean in practice?
It means it’s not enough if tags/foo/ shows all posts tagged “foo”, tags/ should also show all tags.
Similarly, it’s not enough if /blog/2023/04/private-fields-considered-harmful/ links to the corresponding blog post,
but also:
/blog/2023/04/ should show all posts from April 2023
/blog/2023/ should show all posts from 2023
/blog/ should show all posts

                  <p>When you think of directors that have influenced Wes Anderson, you typically think of Truffaut, Godard, Scorcese, and Ashby. But as you&#x27;ll see in this video of Anderson pulling out some recommended films from this Paris video store, his taste in movies is broad. There&#x27;s Drunken Angel (Kurosawa), A Streetcar Named Desire (Kazan), Vagabond (Varda), Birth (Glazer), Bridge of Spies (Spielberg), and Witness (Weir).
Of Spielberg, Anderson says:
If you make movies, if you direct movies, this is somebody who can help you. You looked at his movies for solutions. He usually found a way to do it right. He&#x27;s one of my favorites.

                  <p>This, from XKCD, hits my science and design interests right in the sweet spot.
If you covered the surface of the Atlantic Ocean with twelve-point printed text, with the lines wrapping at the coasts, the expansion of the ocean basin due to tectonics would increase your word count by about 100 words per second.


This reminds me of Ben Terrett&#x27;s calculation of how many helveticas from here to the Moon and my subsequent calculations about the point size of the Earth and the Moon (50.2 billion and 13.7 billion, respectively).

                  <p>Following on from my hard and easy way of getting timezone from an IP address, having the timezone (as text) is one thing, now finding the actual offset is entirely a different problem.

TL:DR; jump to the spoiler if you can&#x27;t be bothered to read/listen to me ramble!
The problem isn&#x27;t timezones, it&#x27;s day light saving
It&#x27;s all very well knowing what timezone a particularly location is sitting on. We can show the user the UTC time, but when it doesn&#x27;t match the wall clock because they&#x27;re currently observing DST, then it&#x27;s just…weird.
So now we need to know if the location is observing DST, or not. Or if perhaps they never observe DST (like Hawaii).
The long hard way
There is the IANA timezone dataset which has custom data structures that describe the location and how time is observed in that…</p>

                  <p>So I recently ported my 14 year old blog from WordPress to Eleventy.
I had been using Disqus for comments for years, so I didn’t want to lose them, even if I ended up using a different solution for the future (or no comments at all).
Looking around for an existing solution did not yield many results.
There’s Zach’s eleventy-import-disqus but it’s aimed at importing Disqus comments as static copies,
but I wanted to have the option to continue using Disqus.
Looking at the WP generated HTML source, I noticed that Disqus was using the WP post id (a number that is not displayed in the UI) to link its threads to the posts.
However, the importer I used did not preserve the post ids as metadata (filed issue #95).
What to do?

My first thought was to add the post id to each po…</p>

                  <p>Still one of my favorite internet things: The case of the 500-mile email.
I was working in a job running the campus email system some years ago when I got a call from the chairman of the statistics department.
&quot;We&#x27;re having a problem sending email out of the department.&quot;
&quot;What&#x27;s the problem?&quot; I asked.
&quot;We can&#x27;t send mail more than 500 miles,&quot; the chairman explained.
I choked on my latte.  &quot;Come again?&quot;
&quot;We can&#x27;t send mail farther than 500 miles from here,&quot; he repeated.  &quot;A little bit more, actually.  Call it 520 miles.  But no farther.&quot;
&quot;Um... Email really doesn&#x27;t work that way, generally,&quot; I said, trying to keep panic out of my voice.  One doesn&#x27;t display panic when speaking to a department chairman, even of a relatively impoverished department like statistics.  &quot;What makes you think you can&#x27;t send mail more than 500 miles?&quot;
&quot;It&#x27;s not what I *think*,&quot; the chairman replied testily.  &quot;You see, when we first noticed this happening, a few days ago—&quot;
&quot;You waited a few DAYS?&quot; I interrupted, a tremor tinging my voice.  &quot;And you couldn&#x27;t send email this whole time?&quot;
&quot;We could send email.  Just not more than—&quot;
&quot;—500 miles, yes,&quot; I finished for him, &quot;I got that.  But why didn&#x27;t you call earlier?&quot;
&quot;Well, we hadn&#x27;t collected enough data to be sure of what was going on until just now.&quot;  Right.  This is the chairman of *statistics*. &quot;Anyway, I asked one of the geostatisticians to look into it—&quot;
&quot;Geostatisticians...&quot;
&quot;—yes, and she&#x27;s produced a map showing the radius within which we can send email to be slightly more than 500 miles.  There are a number of destinations within that radius that we can&#x27;t reach, either, or reach sporadically, but we can never email farther than this radius.&quot;

	
Here&#x27;s a FAQ that addresses some of the questions the more technically inclined among you may have about this story.

                  <p>This is a supercut of the final moments of the Titanic as represented in various films and TV shows, from 1912&#x27;s La Hantise to a 2012 British TV series written by Downton Abbey&#x27;s Julian Fellowes. It also doubles as a demonstration of the increasing capabilities and aspirations of filmmakers and their special effects teams throughout the years, although in terms of budget and effort, James Cameron&#x27;s effort in 1997 marks the high point.

                  <p>Greta Gerwig takes us on a whirlwind tour through 33 films that influenced the Barbie movie, visually, thematically, and in terms of plot/content. The influences include The Wizard of Oz, Rear Window, Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure, Singin&#x27; in the Rain, The Godfather, Oklahoma!, 2001, and Saturday Night Fever.
Then, Saturday Night Fever, I always had a sense of wanting this to be a movie with an amazing soundtrack. Saturday Night Fever obviously has this incredible soundtrack by the Bee Gees. There&#x27;s a documentary about the Bee Gees, and I&#x27;d seen it and was so touched by the Bee Gees, and I thought Barbie seemed so disco to me in her heart, because Barbie&#x27;s sort of — and I will say this as a lover of Barbie and disco — a little bit dorky in the best way. Saturday Night Fever was a movie that was driven by music, but not a musical. I guess we&#x27;re half of a musical.

                  <p>Jia Tolentino writing for the New Yorker on What to Do with Climate Emotions:
Climate anxiety differs from many forms of anxiety a person might discuss in therapy — anxiety about crowds, or public speaking, or insufficiently washing one&#x27;s hands — because the goal is not to resolve the intrusive feeling and put it away. &quot;It&#x27;s not a keep-calm-and-carry-on approach,&quot; Davenport told me. When it comes to climate change, the brain&#x27;s desire to resolve anxiety and distress often leads either to denial or fatalism: some people convince themselves that climate change is not a big deal, or that someone else will take care of it; others conclude that all is lost and there&#x27;s nothing to be done. Davenport pushes her clients to aim for a middle ground of sustainable distress. We must, she says, become more comfortable in uncertainty, and remain present and active in the midst of fear and grief. Her clients usually struggle with this task in one of two ways, she said: they tend to be activists who can&#x27;t acknowledge their feelings or people so aware of their feelings that they fail to act.

                  <p>In this video from Architectural Digest, architect Michael Wyetzner runs us through why American diners look the way they do. Early diners took their cues from trains:
So let&#x27;s take a look at a typical American diner. So the outside has a shape that&#x27;s reminiscent of a train. In fact, that&#x27;s how diners got their name. They&#x27;re named after the dining car on a train.
Many of the design elements in a diner are based on the necessities of dining on a train in a railroad car, like booth seating and counter seating, and an open kitchen.
So I like these two photos because they show all the elements that go into the classic American diner. On the exterior, you have that stainless steel smooth curvature, you&#x27;ve got that Art Deco typography. And then on the interior you have the checkered floor, you have the booths, you have the globes, and you have the jukebox.
In the early part of the 20th century, trains were the dominant form of travel. If you look at some of the earliest diners, they were in fact, actual train cars that were placed permanently on the ground.


Later, cars and space travel provided inspiration in the diner&#x27;s evolution.

                  <p>The Friar&#x27;s Club was founded in 1904 and, like other private social clubs of the era, their membership was male-only. Women could visit as guests but only after 4pm and the club didn&#x27;t admit its first woman as a member until Liza Minnelli in 1987.
One of the club&#x27;s biggest traditions was its closed-door luncheon roasts of celebrities, which over the years included roasts of Humphrey Bogart, Johnny Carson, Milton Berle, Redd Foxx, and Bruce Willis.1 A few women were roasted before 1987 (Lucille Ball, Martha Raye, Barbra Streisand) but they were not allowed as guests. They even sent the waiters out of the room for the roasts.
In 1983, after months of planning, Phyllis Diller dressed up as a man (named Phillip Downey) and attended the roast of Sid Caesar (she&#x27;s on the left in the photo above with her co-conspirator, Howard Rosen). Here are a pair of videos of Diller talking about her infiltration. To be fair, the Friar&#x27;s Club didn&#x27;t seem that mad at her because they roasted her just two years later.

In 2004, the club roasted Donald Trump (roastmaster was Regis Philbin) and the next year Trump served as roastmaster for Don King. What a weird time/place/thing.↩

                  <p>This is great: The Cut asked 100 people to scream as loud as they could in front of a camera. For some, it was cathartic while others found it uncomfortable. Some folks didn&#x27;t know how to scream which I don&#x27;t entirely understand?
This video reminded me a lot of Ten Meter Tower, one of my all-time favorite short documentaries, in which dozens of people are filmed jumping from a 10-meter diving platform for the first time. Both videos deal with inner vs. outer selves and people&#x27;s comfort with expressing vulnerability. (via colossal)

                  <p>I&#x27;ve been branching out from my usual Game Boy folly and have been tinkering with the Wonder Swan (an interesting little Japanese exclusive handheld). The original Wonder Swan can do eight shades of grey and has no backlight (very much like the original Game Boys for viewing).
Given my experience with Game Boys and recent (basic) electronics, I thought I&#x27;d try my hand at a backlight mod (where LEDs are used light up behind the display). I&#x27;m pretty happy with the final result and this is how I did it.

Build steps
For the backlight, I used a faulty DS Lite display - both bottom or top screen will work as we&#x27;re only interested in the LED and filters.

From the DS Lite display, remove the metal shielding from the back, remove the front polarizer (I&#x27;m guessing) and then separate the back (whit…</p>

                  <p>For the last few years, Amazon has spent a couple of summer days putting a bunch of their most popular items on sale for their Prime members. This year, Prime Day runs from July 11-12 and includes a number of things that I can personally recommend (or are currently coveting). Keep in mind that you need to be an Amazon Prime member to take advantage of these deals: here&#x27;s where you sign up for Prime if you&#x27;re interested (there&#x27;s a free 30-day trial).
Ok first, there are a bunch of deals on Apple products, including the 2nd-generation AirPods Pro (20% off) that I am a big fan of. (That&#x27;s actually not a Prime-only deal, but it&#x27;s $50 cheaper than Apple sells them for.) The AirPods Max are $100 off, the 2nd-gen AirPods are just $90 (30% off), and the 3rd-gen AirPods are $30 off.

                  <p>There&#x27;s a small moment in second-to-last episode of the season two of The Bear (extremely mild spoilers) that I liked even though you blink and you&#x27;ll miss it. One of the new chefs is tentatively salting some steaks and Sydney says &quot;I need you to salt that like a sidewalk&quot;. Cut to Carmy, who walks up muttering &quot;Where&#x27;d you grow up, Arizona?&quot;, takes the salt, and absolutely just drenches the steaks in salt. And I was like, yeah, that&#x27;s how you salt a steak!
Several years ago, I started noticing in various cooking videos how much salt chefs put in &amp; on food, particularly meat. I already knew that ample salting was important to the flavor, but I hadn&#x27;t realized that I wasn&#x27;t going far enough. I was being timid with my salting, afraid of oversalting and ruining dinner. Around this time, I read a Wired piece by chef David Chang about his Unified Theory of Deliciousness and I&#x27;ve been following his recommendation about salting food ever since:
My first breakthrough on this idea was with salt. It&#x27;s the most basic ingredient, but it can also be hellishly complex. A chef can go crazy figuring out how much salt to add to a dish. But I believe there is an objectively correct amount of salt, and it is rooted in a counterintuitive idea. Normally we think of a balanced dish as being neither too salty nor undersalted. I think that&#x27;s wrong. When a dish is perfectly seasoned, it will taste simultaneously like it has too much salt and too little salt. It is fully committed to being both at the same time.


This is the way. You&#x27;ll screw it up sometimes and go overboard, but if you can consistently get right up to that edge, your food will taste the best it possibly can. This works particularly well with steaks and burgers...my burger went from &quot;pretty good&quot; to &quot;holy shit&quot; solely on the application of the proper amount of salt.

My town here in central VT did not flood last night (though some area fields may have) and appears to be out of danger but other places around me were not so lucky.
In particular, I&#x27;m stunned by the several feet of water that are currently covering Montpelier, the capital of Vermont and a place that I know pretty well. This is a video from late last night and early this morning of someone paddling around downtown Montpelier, surveying the flooding and interviewing locals:

The water is not rushing, just standing, and there is almost no one around — there&#x27;s an eerie quiet that&#x27;s punctuated by the sounds of alarms going off all around. And there&#x27;s just so much water.…</p>

                  <p>In 1997, Wired magazine published an article called The Long Boom: A History of the Future, 1980–2020 (archived). The subtitle reads: &quot;We&#x27;re facing 25 years of prosperity, freedom, and a better environment for the whole world. You got a problem with that?&quot; As you might expect, the piece makes interesting reading here in the actual future, particularly the sidebar of &quot;10 Scenario Spoilers&quot;:
The long boom is a scenario, one possible future. It&#x27;s built upon the convergence of many big forces and even more little pieces falling into place — all of them with a positive twist. The future of course, could turn out to be very different — particularly if a few of those big pieces go haywire. Here are 10 things that could cut short the long boom.

                  <p>Craig Mod recently finished a 16-day tour of jazz kissas in northern Japan. Jazz kissas are bar/cafes where one goes to listen to jazz, mostly on records and not live. Mod loosely defies them thusly:
Mostly defined as: Mid-20th century &quot;listening cafes&quot; for jazz music. But there is a lot of variance in this definition. Lots are coffee-focused cafes, fitting into the broader &quot;kissaten&quot; universe. But some are more bar-like, and some even jazz clubs (but for the most part, live music is rare). You can tie yourself in knots splitting hairs over this stuff. Though they&#x27;re traditionally known as &quot;jazz kissa&quot; — the shortened version of &quot;kissaten&quot; (fear not: even if you call them &quot;jazz kissaten&quot; you won&#x27;t suddenly turn into a pillar of salt). Some are seventy years old. Some forty. Some are five years old. The important defining element is simply: A presiding and effusive ever-abiding love for jazz, jazz, and more jazz.


At each stop, he recorded the ambient sounds of each kissa so that you can experience a little bit of the atmosphere at these places — here&#x27;s the full playlist. The recordings were done with a pair of microphones so that the audio is in stereo. This sounds great with a good pair of headphones!

                  </ul>
                  <p>In a piece from January, Cory Doctorow outlined the enshittification lifecycle of online platforms:
Here is how platforms die: First, they are good to their users; then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers; finally, they abuse those business customers to claw back all the value for themselves. Then, they die.
...
This is enshittification: Surpluses are first directed to users; then, once they&#x27;re locked in, surpluses go to suppliers; then once they&#x27;re locked in, the surplus is handed to shareholders and the platform becomes a useless pile of shit. From mobile app stores to Steam, from Facebook to Twitter, this is the enshittification lifecycle.


Taking note of various platforms lighting themselves on fire recently, Mike Masnick offers a list of rules for the leadership of these platforms to follow to avoid turning into dumpster fires. Here&#x27;s rule #3:
Create more value than you capture. This one is not mine, but Tim O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s, and it&#x27;s one that constantly sticks with me. As you&#x27;re developing a business model, the best way to make sure that you&#x27;re serving your users best, and not enshittifying everything, is to constantly make sure that you&#x27;re only capturing some of the value you&#x27;re creating, and are instead putting much more out into the world, especially for your community. Your investors will push you to capture more and more of that value, but again, when you start chasing that, you&#x27;re also spiraling down the enshittification curve.


IMO, some of what is going on with Twitter &amp; Reddit is not enshittification per se, but more of a pushback against the power of their users. (I always think of Tron in instances like these. &quot;I fight for the users!&quot;) I think these CEOs know on some level that they&#x27;re making their product worse, but bringing their user bases to heel is worth the short-term headaches.

                  <p>Hello! Here’s a new entry in the “cool software julia likes” section.
A little while ago I started using a Mac, and one of my biggest
frustrations with it is that often I need to run Linux-specific software. For
example, the nginx playground I
posted about the other day only works on Linux because it uses Linux namespaces (via bubblewrap)
to sandbox nginx. And I’m working on another playground right now that uses bubblewrap too.
This post is very short, it’s just to say that Lima seems nice and much simpler
to get started with than Vagrant.
enter Lima!
I was complaining about this to a friend, and they mentioned
Lima, which stands for Linux on Mac. I’d heard
of colima (another way to run Linux
containers on Mac), but I hadn’t realized that Lima also just lets you run VMs.
It was surprising…</p>

                  <p>Hello! In 2021 I released a small playground for testing nginx configurations
called nginx playground. There’s a
blog post about it here.
This is an extremely short post to say that at the time I didn’t make it open source,
but I am making it open source now. It’s not a lot of code but maybe it’ll be
interesting to someone.
Here’s the github repo. The
frontend is in static/ and the backend is in api/. The README is mostly an
extended apology for the developer experience and note that the project is
unmaintained. But I did test that the build instructions work!
why didn’t I open source this before?
I’m not very good at open source. Some of the problems I have with open sourcing things are:
I dislike (and am very bad at) maintaining open source projects – I usually
ignore basically all feature requests and most bug reports and then feel bad about it.
I handed off maintainership to both of the open source projects that I
started (rbspy and rust-bcc) to other people who are doing a MUCH better job than I ever did.
Sometimes the developer experience for the project is pretty bad
Sometimes there’s configuration in the project (like the fly.toml or the
analytics I have set up) which don’t really make sense for other people to
copy
new approach: don’t pretend I’m going to improve it
In the past I’ve had some kind of belief that I’m going to improve the problems
with my code later. But I haven’t touched this project in more than a year and
I think it’s unlikely I’m going to go back to it unless it breaks in some dramatic way.
So instead of pretending I’m going to improve things, I decided to just:
tell people in the README that the project is unmaintained
write down all the security caveats I know about
test the build instructions I wrote to make sure that they work (on a fresh machine, even!)
explain (but do not fix!!) some of the messy parts of the project
that’s all!
Maybe I will open source more of my tiny projects in the future, we’ll see!
Thanks to Sumana Harihareswara for helping me
think through this.</p>

                  <p>I just finished reading Octavia Butler&#x27;s Parable of the Sower (so good!) and while doing a little customary post-read research on it, I discovered that Butler wrote a sequel in 1998 called Parable of the Talents and, uh... (from Wikipedia):
The novel is set against the backdrop of a dystopian United States that has come under the grip of a Christian fundamentalist denomination called &quot;Christian America&quot; led by President Andrew Steele Jarret. Seeking to restore American power and prestige, and using the slogan &quot;Make America Great Again&quot;, Jarret embarks on a crusade to cleanse America of non-Christian faiths. Slavery has resurfaced with advanced &quot;shock collars&quot; being used to control slaves. Virtual reality headsets known as &quot;Dreamasks&quot; are also popular since they enable wearers to escape their harsh reality.


Well, our present reality certainly checks a remarkable number of those boxes, including an absolute bullseye on &quot;Make America Great Again&quot;.

                  <p>This is a poster for the 2023 International Book Arsenal Festival which recently took place in Kyiv, Ukraine. The poster was designed by Art Studio Agrafka from an illustration they originally did for the cover of Linkiesta Magazine.
A book festival. During a war. In a city under martial law. While schools and legislatures here in the US ban books about Black and LGBTQ+ experiences based on bad faith complaints of tiny fundamentalist parent groups. Tell me, who&#x27;s doing democracy better right now? (via @gray)

                  <p>On Mastodon I was joking that I want to create a social media simulator app that takes you through the exhausting process of setting up an account (avatar, enticing follow-able description of yourself, a unique name, a solid unrememberable password…) and then it gives you a space to say things into the void. Whatever you say rewards you with that unending gratification of juicy feedback we associate with social media. This particular void rewards you generously. You could say the dumbest things and get a ridiculous amount of simulated engagement. Nothing you say is actually posted anywhere. It’s just for...</p>

                  <p>Not going to bury the lede here: this is a straight-up masterpiece and maybe the best thing I&#x27;ve seen all week. Hidari is a stop-motion animation of an inventive fight sequence between a lone warrior/craftsman and a boss &amp; his minions. The vibe of the animation is at once halting and buttery smooth, a combination that&#x27;s wonderfully expressive. Directed by Masashi Kawamura, the plan is to turn this into a feature-length film:
This is a pilot version of the stop-motion samurai film that tells the story of &quot;Jingoro Hidari,&quot; a legendary Edo-era craftsman. All the characters are made by wood and animated frame by frame, just like how Jingoro&#x27;s wooden sculptures came to life in his many anecdotes. We hope you enjoy this film, which mixes dynamic actions as seen in Japanimation, and the rich analog expressions of stop-motion animation.
Our intention is to use this pilot film as a starting point to create a full length feature film. We have started activities to raise the necessary partners and funding to achieve this goal.


Take my money! (P.S. Turn on subtitles if you don&#x27;t speak Japanese. Oh, and here&#x27;s a behind-the-scenes look at how they did the animation.)

Turns out, it is what we want; this piece is brilliant. But it&#x27;s also unexplainable, so I&#x27;ll just post these three snippets and let you work out whether you want to read the rest of it or not.
As I read, I thought Wallace must have been taken by something very simple, the smallest sensual fact: that as an IRS worker you are issued a new social security number, in essence a new identity, a chance to start over. The old number, the old life, &#x27;simply disappeared, from an identification standpoint&#x27;. A whole novel could take flesh from that fact, one about the idea of bureaucratic identity as opposed to …</p>

                  <p>Yesterday I posted about the 2023 Drone Photo Awards and one of my favorite shots was of a playground/park in Poland. My curious pal Neven tracked down more information about the park and, well, it&#x27;s so cool and cute!



Here&#x27;s part of the description from the park&#x27;s creators, SLAS Architects:
&quot;Activity zone&quot; is a multifunctional public space which is the first phase of regeneration and integration of the University of Silesia campus with the urban tissue of Chorzów City.
The site is located in the place of the demolished military building with a number of old existing trees. &quot;Activity zone&quot; is designed as concrete platform strongly perforated and filled with a diverse programme that includes: students leisure zone, children&#x27;s play devices, fitness, individually designed elements of street furniture and greenery including all existing trees. Some parts of the garden are possible to develop by local seniors. The platform connects the diverse program, intensifies the use of the place and becomes itself an element of play. Variety of attractions enhance interactions between users of all age groups and integrates academic community with local inhabitants and the surrounding nature.


My only complaint: it&#x27;s maybe a little too small? But otherwise: top marks.

                  <p>Oh boy. I thought the teaser trailer was good, but the full trailer for Martin Scorsese&#x27;s Killers of the Flower Moon just dropped and I am. So. Excited. To. SEE. THIS!
At the turn of the 20th century, oil brought a fortune to the Osage Nation, who became some of the richest people in the world overnight. The wealth of these Native Americans immediately attracted white interlopers, who manipulated, extorted, and stole as much Osage money as they could before resorting to murder.


Once again, it&#x27;s based on David Grann&#x27;s Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI, which I highly recommend. Grann + Scorsese appears to be a potent combination — the latter is already signed on to adapt Grann&#x27;s latest bestseller, The Wager.

As usual, I picked out a few favorites and included them above. From top to bottom, photos by: Sebastian Piórek (a very tidy Polish playground), Gheorghe Popa (amazing abstract shot), Matias Delacroix (a border crossing between Haiti and the Dominican Republic), and Brad Weiner (surfer).

                  <p>Illustrator Kevan Atteberry created the Clippy character that was introduced in Microsoft Office 97. There was a ton of backlash when the character was introduced, but as time has passed, many people have begun to think fondly of him. 
He&#x27;s a guy that just wants to help, and he&#x27;s a little bit too helpful sometimes. And there&#x27;s something fun and vulnerable about that.

                  <p>Astrophotographer Cari Letelier caught this amazing shot of the aurora borealis over the Goðafoss waterfall in Iceland. We live in a truly magical world — if science fiction authors made something like this up, you wouldn&#x27;t believe it&#x27;d ever be real. You can check out more of Letelier&#x27;s astrophotography on Instagram or on her website.
I found this via the Astronomy Picture of the Day site, a gem of the old school web that&#x27;s been sharing astronomy photos since 1995.

                  <p>Precise. Symmetric. Stylized. Controlled (often bright) color palette. Slow-motion. Lateral tracking. These are all hallmarks of Wes Anderson&#x27;s films. But as this short video from Luís Azevedo shows, there are plenty of imperfect moments in his movies as well. Anderson is a canny filmmaker and it&#x27;s the contrast between the controlled worlds he constructs and these more frenetic, off-kilter, imperfect moments that gives them their weight and impact.

                  <p>Photographs have always been an imperfect reproduction of real life — see the story of Dorothea Lange&#x27;s Migrant Mother or Ansel Adams&#x27; extensive dark room work — but the seemingly boundless alterations offered by current &amp; future AI editing tools will allow almost anyone to turn their photos (or should I say &quot;photos&quot;) into whatever they wish. In this video, Evan Puschak briefly explores what AI-altered photos might do to our memories.
I was surprised he didn&#x27;t mention the theory that when a past experience is remembered, that memory is altered in the human brain — that is, &quot;very act of remembering can change our memories&quot;. I think I first heard about this on Radiolab more than 16 years ago. So maybe looking at photos extensively altered by AI could extensively alter those same memories in …</p>

                  <p>Greek photographer Anthimos Ntagkas stalks the streets in search of visual coincidences to capture and put on his Instagram account. My Modern Met talked to Ntagkas about his process:
Nowadays, I don&#x27;t choose the place, but I make every location work for me. I combine people with elements everywhere I stand. Luckily the themes in this type of photography are endless, and I never lose interest.

                  <p>After my wrangle with getting a timezone from an IP address by reducing large databases down from several hundred megabytes down to only a few, then discovering IPv6 didn&#x27;t work (so I then applied my same logic to get 700MB to 10MB), the ever lovely Phil Hawksworth pointed out that (of course) Netlify has this data available in their edge functions.
I totally overlooked the feature (maybe I didn&#x27;t even look!). So let&#x27;s implement that and then discover the glaring bug in all of the code so far.

Netlify edge function&#x27;s geo prop
Phil kindly sent me a direct message on Space Karen&#x27;s website pointing me to the geo property provided in edge function calls.
This (of course 🤦‍♂️) means the code for the function is (for me) stupid simple:
export default async (request, context) &#x3D;&gt; {

Pino spent the first few days of the month on land, having its bottom re-painted, and its various bits serviced and checked. We took our propeller apart for the first time.
We&#x27;ve added a few write-ups of our travels so far (see above entry with links under 100r.co), but the most significant one is our 46nmi sail up to Princess Louisa Inlet, a long fjord on British Columbia&#x27;s Sunshine Coast, with an incredible gem at the end. It is an amazing, and unique place. We&#x27;re glad we finally got to go. As we write this, we are in Roscoe Bay on West Redonda Island, tethering off a phone hoisted up the mast (it works quite well).
This summer we are power stable. We had issues last year because of parisitic draws due to old wiring (see DC electrical refit), but now everything is working as it should. We&#x27;re charging our computers without an inverter, and that too is working out quite well so far (see charging electronics).
Together, Hikari and Lynn made chibicc-uxn, a c compiler for Uxn, and with it also released a port of the classic software Neko(xneko, oneko sakura).

We are reading Arkady and Boris Strugatsky&#x27;s Roadside Picnic. We&#x27;ve been re-watching Kaamelott for the hundredth time.

Rhythm and Blues on Central Avenue, Otis was a central organizing figure in the Los Angeles rhythm &amp; blues scene of the late 1940s and early 1950s — thus, a shrewd move on Syd Nathan’s part when the King Records […]

                  <p>So, ever since I&#x27;d heard that Bill Murray had to drop out of filming Asteroid City, I&#x27;ve wondered which role he&#x27;d meant to play. After seeing the movie, I thought it was either the grandfather (played by Tom Hanks) or the hotel manager (Steve Carell) and it was Carell&#x27;s role:
Murray was originally cast as a motel manager in the desert town where the movie is set, in 1955. &quot;Normally, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s such a nice idea to tell everyone the person who didn&#x27;t end up in the movie,&quot; Anderson said recently. &quot;But Bill got covid in Ireland, and it was four days before he was supposed to work.&quot; Murray was in Ireland for a family trip (&quot;And usually golf has something to do with it,&quot; Anderson said), en route to Spain, where &quot;Asteroid City&quot; was shooting.

                  <p>Elie Mystal writing for the Nation on the Supreme Court&#x27;s recent decision that declared affirmative action in college admissions unconstitutional.
But the death of affirmative action was not achieved merely through the machinations of Republican lawyers. While conservatives on the Supreme Court delivered the fatal blow, the policy has long been made vulnerable by the soft bigotry of parents, whose commitment to integration and equality turns cold the moment their little cherubs fail to get into their first choice of college or university. If you want to see a white liberal drop the pretense that they care about systemic racism and injustice, just tell them that their privately tutored kid didn&#x27;t get into whatever &quot;elite&quot; school they were hoping for. If you want to make an immigrant family adopt a Klansman&#x27;s view of the intelligence, culture, and work ethic of Black folks, tell them that their kid&#x27;s standardized test scores are not enough to guarantee entry into ivy-draped halls of power. Some of the most horribly racist claptrap folks have felt comfortable saying to my face has been said in the context of people telling me why they don&#x27;t like affirmative action, or why my credentials are somehow &quot;unearned&quot; because they were &quot;given&quot; to me by affirmative action.
That last bit is in some ways the most devastating: Black people are attacked and shamed simply because the policy exists, regardless of whether it benefited them or not. I&#x27;ve had white folks whom I could standardize-test into a goddamn coma tell me that I got into school only because of affirmative action. I once talked to a white guy — whose parents&#x27; name was on one of the buildings on campus — who asked me how it felt to know I got &quot;extra help&quot; to get in. The sheer nerve of white folks is sometimes jaw-dropping.


I recommended this yesterday in a Quick Link, but Scene On Radio&#x27;s episode of their Seeing White series on White Affirmative Action is great.

                  <p>From TasteAtlas, a listing of the 150 Most Legendary Restaurants in the World &amp; Their Iconic Dishes. These aren&#x27;t necessarily the best restaurants on Earth, but places that have &quot;withstood the test of time, eschewing trendy gimmicks in favor of traditional, high-quality cuisine&quot;.
Here are a few of the entries from the list that I&#x27;ve either been to or would like to go to someday (ok, almost the whole list would have qualified for that):
2. Katz&#x27;s Delicatessen (pastrami on rye)
Schwartz&#x27;s is iconic, but I think Snowdon Deli has better smoked meat. In the same vein, I&#x27;ve had good steak and not-so-good steak at Luger&#x27;s — as far as an iconic NYC steakhouse goes, I would have gone for Keen&#x27;s.
I&#x27;m sure any food fan worth their (don&#x27;t say it, don&#x27;t say it) salt (ugh) could come up with a few dozen restaurants that could/should be on this list, but 150 is certainly a good start! Soba, bratwurst, ćevapi, udon, churrasco, kofte, phở, ramen, ceviche, sushi, risotto, bouillabaisse, dim sum, BBQ, Peking duck, biryani, xiao long bao...man, I&#x27;m so hungry now!

                  </ul>
                  <p>From Rabbi Danya Ruttenberg, a piece on the still-radical teachings of Fred Rogers, who emphasized the &quot;love thy neighbor&quot; part of the Bible rather than the twisted &quot;persecute the other&quot; version that has taken hold in so-called Christian communities in America over the past few decades.
Fred Rogers was a Presbyterian minister whose life&#x27;s work was, I believe, built almost entirely (if not entirely) around Leviticus 19:18: &quot;Love your neighbor as yourself: I am God.&quot; Hence... the neighborhood. In practice it that looked like this (all of these are his words): &quot;To love someone is to strive to accept that person exactly the way [they are], right here and now.&quot; and &quot;Everyone longs to be loved. And the greatest thing we can do is to let people know that they are loved and capable of loving.&quot;


Part of his philosophy was acknowledging that, because we loved them, we needed to have truthful, difficult conversations with our children. 
When Bobby Kennedy was murdered that same year, he did something that&#x27;s pretty much impossible to our world today.
He had a puppet tiger ask an actor:
&quot;What does &#x27;assassination&#x27; mean?&quot;
He knew that small children would be hearing this word, and that they would be aware that something major had happened. And that most of the time, when adults are preoccupied with communal tragedy and trauma, children get left out-to their own detriment.
Better they should know, in an age-appropriate way, and be given the tools to cope, than to be left out in the cold, as he put it, &quot;at the mercy of their own imaginations.&quot;
Again, naming true things and simply holding space to let children deal with them — rather than trying to hide or minimize or gaslight because it seems too hard.
That&#x27;s love.

                  <p>The Verge has published a list of the 40 best nonfiction books about &quot;tech&quot; (which relates to the industry centered around Silicon Valley &amp; the internet and not technology in general). I was pleased to see Broad Band: The Untold Story of the Women Who Made the Internet by Claire Evans and Small Fry by Lisa Brennan-Jobs on there, as well as Close to the Machine: Technophilia and Its Discontents by Ellen Ullman and Neil Postman&#x27;s Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology. I&#x27;m baffled that Tracy Kidder&#x27;s amazing The Soul of a New Machine didn&#x27;t make the top 5 or even 10.
But reading through the rest of the list, it occurred to me that I don&#x27;t really read tech books — and if I did, I didn&#x27;t get a whole lot from them. When I was younger and trying to understand the industry and momentous period I was participating in, I generally looked to books outside of tech as guides. I read things like How Buildings Learn by Steward Brand, The Death and Life of Great American Cities by Jane Jacobs, Chaos by James Gleick, The Timeless Way of Building by Christopher Alexander, and Understanding Comics by Scott McCloud.
Anyway, back to the list — it seems incomplete in a way that I can&#x27;t quite articulate. I would have liked to have seen Tom Standage&#x27;s The Victorian Internet on there. What else? I would like to hear about your favorite books about tech (or non-tech books that are sneakily about tech anyway) or what you think might be missing from the list. Leave your thoughts in the comments!

                  <p>This week I decided it was time to try to revive some of the casualties from my recent Vercel incident, and though webmentions.app is the more useful, I though I&#x27;d start with the, so I thought, low hanging fruit - &quot;how many days to Christmas&quot;.
It turned into 3 days of complicated problem solving and working against systems that just didn&#x27;t want to work the way I needed.

The context
I have a little app that runs on a internet connected clock that shows the days to Christmas. A little while ago, during December and Jan, the traffic (along with traffic on webmentions.app) spiked hard enough to cause Vercel to block my entire account.
So for the short term, I disabled the countdown app. Christmas, at the time, was a full year away, so I figured it wouldn&#x27;t be missed.

                  <p>The Chickening is a surreal visual remix of Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s The Shining done by Nick DenBoer and Davy Force. It mostly defies description, so just watch the first minute or so (after which you won&#x27;t be able to resist the rest of it). The short film is playing at this year&#x27;s Sundance Film Festival.
But seriously, WTF was that?! (via @UnlikelyWorlds)

                  <p>The other day I posted about how contemporary filmmakers, Wes Anderson in particular, use miniatures in their films. The model/prop maker featured, Simon Weisse, has worked with Anderson on several films, including his latest, Asteroid City. Weisse has been posting behind-the-scenes shots of his studio&#x27;s work on Asteroid City to his under-followed Instagram account and I thought a separate post highlighting some of those props and miniatures would be fun.





This video shows a bunch more of the miniatures used in the movie:

I also ran across a few behind-the-scenes videos of the production if you&#x27;re in the mood to deep-dive (as I appear to be):




If you&#x27;re lucky enough to be in London in the next week and a half, you can go and see some of these props and sets and even eat at the diner at 180 Studios. Very. Jealous.

                  <p>From the Library of Congress, footage of the first gay pride march in NYC in 1970. The march, called the Christopher Street Liberation Day Parade, was held on June 28 to commemorate the first anniversary of the Stonewall Uprising. From Gothamist:
The Christopher Street Gay Liberation Day March started in Greenwich Village at about 2 p.m. that day in 1970, just outside the Stonewall Inn, which was then for rent, having closed the previous October.
As they gathered, the marchers were few, and brave. There were groups from Washington, DC and Boston, college organizations from Rutgers, Yale and Columbia. Some transgender people who were there at the time said that organizers asked them to march in the back, but they refused.
&quot;The trans community said, &#x27;Hell no, we won&#x27;t go.&#x27; We fought for this as much as you did, or even started it,&quot; said Victoria Cruz. &quot;And we just mingled throughout the crowd. There was no trans contingent. We just mingled.&quot;
They started walking very briskly up Christopher Street, because they were scared. There had been bomb threats. People worried they would be shot at, or harassed again by the police. Martin Boyce was there, and he says that afterwards they joked it was &quot;the first run.&quot;
&quot;I was worried about being single file, because I just watched a program on National Geographic about wildebeests and I saw how the ones on the side were picked off. So I thought I would stay in the middle — but there was no middle.&quot;


As the march went on, it gathered people &amp; momentum and they eventually made it without major incident to Central Park.

                  <p>When you write some code and put it on a spacecraft headed into the far reaches of space, you need to it work, no matter what. Mistakes can mean loss of mission or even loss of life. In 2006, Gerard Holzmann of the NASA/JPL Laboratory for Reliable Software wrote a paper called The Power of 10: Rules for Developing Safety-Critical Code. The rules focus on testability, readability, and predictability:
Avoid complex flow constructs, such as goto and recursion.
All loops must have fixed bounds. This prevents runaway code.
Avoid heap memory allocation.
Restrict functions to a single printed page.
Use a minimum of two runtime assertions per function.
Restrict the scope of data to the smallest possible.
Check the return value of all non-void functions, or cast to void to indicate the return value…</p>

                  <p>The “const” keyword in JavaScript is used to create constants, variables that can&#x27;t change. Curiously, though, we do seem to be able to edit objects and arrays that are created using “const”. In this tutorial, we&#x27;re going to dig into the incredibly-important distinction between “assignment” and “mutation” in JavaScript.</p>

                  <p>My pal Clive Thompson, who is in the midst of a two-part bicycle ride across the United States and is writing a book on micromobility, thinks local, state, and federal governments should start offering substantial subsidies for e-bikes in order to help reduce car usage, decrease urban pollution, and to lower the cost of transportation for lower-income families.
The thing is, we should lean heavily into subsidies for electric bikes — now.
If Denver&#x27;s experience is any guide, it&#x27;d be a huge boon for town, cities, and even many suburbs. Ebikes can&#x27;t be used to replace all car travel, of course; but as folks who experiment with them discover, wow, you start leaving your car at home a lot. If towns and cities are smart about how they organize and issue these credits, they can also help lower-in…</p>

                  <p>Yuri Suzuki&#x27;s The Ambient Machine is a device for creating atmosphere, playing ambient sounds. The machine has 32 toggle switches on it; each switch actives a different sound (waves, running water, birds, wind, white noise) that you can blend to create your perfect aural backdrop.
The Ambient Machine provides us with a variety of sounds and music that we can use to design our own background ambience. White noise can mask unpleasant sounds around us and give us a sense of relief, Natural sounds can provide the feeling of relocating to a new environment, providing a break from the environments we have been confined to, and musical rhythms can provide patterns for us to find stability with.


Only 20 models of the original machine were created and sold, but you can preorder a slightly different version for ¥143,000 (~$1,000).

                  <p>In 1990, the US government sent $20,000 and a formal letter of apology to more than 82,000 Japanese Americans who were incarcerated in concentration camps during World War II. Morgan Ome, whose grandfather was imprisoned and got a check, looks at the effect this had on those who received it and how the reparative process might look for other communities (Black and Native Americans).
In one of the letters, the daughter of an incarceree tells how the $20,000, invested in her family&#x27;s home equity and compounded over time, ultimately enabled her to attend Yale. &quot;The redress money my family received has always been a tailwind at my back, making each step of the way a tiny bit easier,&quot; she wrote. Just as her family was able to build generational equity, she hoped that Black Americans, too, would…</p>

                  <p>Vox talks to prop &amp; model maker Simon Weisse, who made miniatures for Wes Anderson&#x27;s Asteroid City, about the perhaps surprising popularity of miniatures in contemporary filmmaking, when the technique works and when it doesn&#x27;t (e.g. when unscalable elements like rain or fire/explosions are involved), and why certain directors use it instead of CGI.
Miniatures in movies are way more common than you may realize, and one of the most stylish filmmakers keeping them alive is Wes Anderson. In this video we spoke to Simon Weisse, prop maker and model marker for some of Wes Anderson&#x27;s recent projects, like The Grand Budapest Hotel, The French Dispatch, and Asteroid City.
Older movies, like 1977&#x27;s Star Wars: Episode IV — A New Hope, had no choice but to use miniatures to make their worlds feel real. But even in the modern day of CGI, filmmakers are still using minis — just look at projects like The Mandalorian, Blade Runner 2049, Harry Potter, and The Dark Knight series. In those movies, miniatures are used for expansive sets that establish the world of a film, otherworldly vehicles like spaceships, and more.


It&#x27;s perfect for Anderson&#x27;s storybook aesthetic, of course...it looks great in Asteroid City (which I really enjoyed overall).

                  <p>This is apparently extremely old news (like almost 20 years old), but I ran across the cover that Chris Ware did for Voltaire&#x27;s Candide in the bookstore yesterday and it still slaps.
P.S. The book covers tag is pretty good if you want to get distracted/inspired by fantastic design for 30 minutes.

Typewriter map of Africa by the cartographer Daniel Huffman. It was done by resizing a map of Africa into 75×60 pixels, add a shaded relief, categorize each pixel according to intensity, convert it to ASCII, add details in Illustrator, and then type it on a typewriter.

                  <p>Hello! On Wednesday, we released a new zine: How Integers and Floats Work!
You can get it for $12 here:
https://wizardzines.com/zines/integers-floats, or get
an 13-pack of all my zines here.
Here’s the cover:

Here’s the table of contents!

  
Now let’s talk about some of the motivations for writing this zine!
motivation 1: demystify binary
I wrote this zine because I used to find binary data really impenetrable. There
are all these 0s and 1s! What does it mean?
But if you look at any binary file format, most of it is integers! For example,
if you look at the DNS parsing in Implement DNS in a Weekend, it’s all about encoding and
decoding a bunch of integers (plus some ASCII strings, which arguably are also arrays of integers).
So I think that learning how integers w…</p>

                  <p>Or rather, protozoan? Toxoplasma gondii is a protozoan parasite which is transmitted from rodents to cats through a crafty mechanism...it makes mice attracted to the smell of cat urine. Mouse goes near cat, cat eats mouse, T. gondii has a new host. From cats, the parasite can jump into humans, where it may be responsible for all sorts of nastiness:
Well, the behavioral influence plays out in a number of strange ways. Toxoplasma infection in humans has been associated with everything from slowed reaction times to a fondness toward cat urine — to more extreme behaviors such as depression and even schizophrenia. And here&#x27;s the kicker: Two different research groups have independently shown that Toxo-infected individuals are three to four times as likely of being killed in car accidents due to reckless driving.

	
And maybe makes us want to invent networking technology and share cool links? In this five-minute talk, Kevin Slavin cleverly connects viral media with T. gondii:

That video was so good, I watched the whole thing twice.

                  <p>The creepy twins. Jack feverish at the typewriter. Danny riding his Big Wheel through carpeted hallways. The elevators of blood. These familiar scenes from Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s horror classic The Shining (and several more) have been recreated in this Lego stop-motion animation. The video took 50-60 hours over a three-week period to make and was an exercise in constraints:
&quot;Mostly, it came down to choosing the right pieces,&quot; he says. &quot;I made this movie only with pieces I already had in my collection, so I had to do with just what I had laying around. For instance, the famous carpet pattern in the hallway could have been more realistic, but with the pieces I had, it became a little more abstract. I went with clay for the bloody elevator scene also because I do not have thousands of red translucent pieces.&quot;

                  <p>I loved Liu Cixin&#x27;s The Three-Body Problem trilogy (read it twice!) and was excited/apprehensive when Netflix announced they&#x27;d partnered with Game of Thrones showrunners D.B. Weiss and David Benioff to adapt the books into a TV series. Well, the first trailer is here and has tipped my scales more towards excited. Really looking forward to when this premieres in January 2024 — if they get it right, this could be something really special.

                  <p>Humility, a designer’s essential value—that has a nice ring to it. What about humility, an office manager’s essential value? Or a dentist’s? Or a librarian’s? They all sound great. When humility is our guiding light, the path is always open for fulfillment, evolution, connection, and engagement. In this chapter, we’re going to talk about why.
That said, this is a book for designers, and to that end, I’d like to start with a story—well, a journey, really. It’s a personal one, and I’m going to make myself a bit vulnerable along the way. I call it:
The Tale of Justin’s Preposterous Pate
When I was coming out of art school, a long-haired, goateed neophyte, print was a known quantity to me; design on the web, however, was rife with complexities to navigate and discover, a problem to be solved. …</p>

                  <p>Using the metaphor of a cancerous tumor as an unruly village, Kurzgesagt explains how cancer develops in the human body, how the body fights against it, and how, sometimes, the cancer develops into something unmanageable.
In a sense this tiny tumor is like a rogue town. Imagine a group of rebels in Brooklyn decided that they were no longer part of New York but started a new settlement called Tumor Town, which happens to  occupy the same space. The new city wants to grow, so it orders tons of steel beams, cement and drywall. New buildings follow no logic, are badly planned, ugly and dangerously crooked. They are built right in the middle of streets, on top of playgrounds and on existing  infrastructure. The old neighborhood is torn down or overbuilt to make room for new stuff. Many of the former residents are trapped in the  middle of it and begin to starve. This goes on for a while until the smell of death finally attracts attention. Building inspectors and police show up.

The short answer is consolidation caused by deregulation but the longer answer is worth watching. And if you want more information, Edwards&#x27; list of sources in the video description is pretty extensive.

If you were to bother to read my books, to behave as educated persons would, you would learn that they are not sexy, and do not argue in favor of wildness of any kind. They beg that people be kinder and more responsible than they often are. It is true that some of the characters speak coarsely. That is because people speak coarsely in real life. Especially soldiers and hardworking men speak coarsely, and even our most sheltered children know that. And we all know, too, that those words really don&#x27;t damage children much. They didn&#x27;t damage us when we were young. It was evil deeds and lying that hurt us.

There are several scenes from this video that would not be out of place in this collection of Real-Life Infrastructure That Looks Like Sci-Fi. And there&#x27;s a color gradient moment near the end that&#x27;s really lovely. (thx, alex)

                  <p>This conversation with musician Perfume Genius about his creative process is interesting throughout. This is something I relate to 1000%:
I&#x27;m good at making things, but not talking about why. I made them because I don&#x27;t know how to talk about why. The explanation is the thing I made.


This too is something I try to hold myself to:
I also just do it, you know what I mean? I just make shit. 90% of doing anything is doing it. Not to sound self-help-y, but when people are asking me for advice, my first thought is, you should just do it. You beat so many people already if you just actually make a finished thing.


I am still a perfectionist sort of person, but when your work entails publishing 10-20 things in public every single day, you have to let go of that. Good enough is better than nothing at all.
Embrace your inner little baby (with really good taste):
I essentially have to get back to feeling like I&#x27;m a little baby to make things that are good. A baby with really good taste.

                  <p>In the 60s and 70s, Howard Johnson&#x27;s was the largest restaurant chain in the US — the restaurants and their associated hotels were ubiquitous while travelling America&#x27;s roadways. So it made sense that when Stanley Kubrick needed a hospitality brand for the Earthlight Room on the space station circling Earth in 2001: A Space Odyssey, he reached for HoJo&#x27;s.
And of course, even in 1968, you had to do some sort of cross-promotion and, bizarrely, what Howard Johnson&#x27;s came up with was a 2001-themed children&#x27;s menu.

Even more weirdly, the menu is not about the movie itself, it&#x27;s about a family that goes to see the movie. The whole opening sequence with the apes is omitted entirely, as is the HAL 9000 (arguably the film&#x27;s main character) — I suspect the HoJo&#x27;s people didn&#x27;t get to see the entire movie while putting this together (as evidenced by the &quot;preview edition&quot; graphic in the bottom right corner of the menu&#x27;s cover). 

It&#x27;s cool to see scenes from the movie rendered in comics form:


You can see the entire menu here, including the activity page — just click on one of the images to enter slideshow mode. (via meanwhile)

                  <p>Using data from the ESA&#x27;s Mars Express probe, the German Aerospace Center has released an enhanced color image of Mars that shows off the planet&#x27;s geology and mineral content better than the usual dusty red photos do. Here&#x27;s part of what you&#x27;re seeing:
It is well known that most of Mars is reddish in colour, due to the high amount of oxidised iron in the dust on its surface, earning it the nickname the &#x27;Red Planet&#x27;. But it is also immediately noticeable that a considerable region of Mars is rather dark, appearing bluish in colour in image 1. These regions represent greyish-blackish-bluish sands, which are volcanic in origin and form large, dark sand layers on Mars. They were primarily piled up by the wind to form imposing sand dunes or enormous dune fields on the floor of impact craters. These unweathered sands consist of dark, basaltic minerals, of which volcanic lava on Earth is also composed. Basalt is the most widespread volcanic rock on Earth — and in the Solar System. Earth&#x27;s ocean floor is made of basalt, as are the extinct volcanoes of the Eifel, Mount Etna in Sicily and volcanoes of the Hawaiian archipelago.


In my mind, the best bit is how much clearer you can see the various geographical features of the planet. (via bad astronomy)

                  <p>According to recent research from linguists Phillip Carter and Kristen D&#x27;Alessandro Merii, a new dialect of English is forming in South Florida. The dialect, distinct from Spanglish, is spoken English that borrows lexical and semantic rules translated from Spanish. Carter writes:
For example, we found people to use expressions such as &quot;get down from the car&quot; instead of &quot;get out of the car.&quot; This is based on the Spanish phrase &quot;bajar del carro,&quot; which translates, for speakers outside of Miami, as &quot;get out of the car.&quot; But &quot;bajar&quot; means &quot;to get down,&quot; so it makes sense that many Miamians think of &quot;exiting&quot; a car in terms of &quot;getting down&quot; and not &quot;getting out.&quot;
Locals often say &quot;married with,&quot; as in &quot;Alex got married with Jos&#x27;e,&quot; based on the Spanish &quot;casarse con&quot; — literally translated as &quot;married with.&quot; They&#x27;ll also say &quot;make a party,&quot; a literal translation of the Spanish &quot;hacer una fiesta.&quot;
We also found &quot;semantic calques,&quot; or loan translations of meaning. In Spanish, &quot;carne,&quot; which translates as &quot;meat,&quot; can refer to both all meat, or to beef, a specific kind of meat. We discovered local speakers saying &quot;meat&quot; to refer specifically to &quot;beef&quot; — as in, &quot;I&#x27;ll have one meat empanada and two chicken empanadas.&quot;


I particularly liked this one:
We found that some expressions were used only among the immigrant generation — for example, &quot;throw a photo,&quot; from &quot;tirar una foto,&quot; as a variation of &quot;take a photo.&quot;

                  <p>This short video from Vox takes a look at the recent Supreme Court decision that struck down a gerrymandered congressional map in Alabama. 
In 2013, a divided Supreme Court gutted one of the major pillars of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. In the 10 years since then, the court has moved even farther to the right. So when the Voting Rights Act came before the Supreme Court again in 2022, it didn&#x27;t look good for the law. But then something completely unexpected happened: in a 5-4 decision, two of the conservative justices voted with the 3 liberal justices to preserve the Voting Rights Act. And the effects could be huge.
At stake in the case was the way that Alabama divides up its Congressional districts. Alabama has seven districts, one of which is what&#x27;s called a &quot;majority-minority district&quot; in which Black Americans are the majority of the population. In 2022, a group of Black voters sued the state, saying that under the law, Alabama should actually have two majority-minority districts. And the Supreme Court agreed.


The decision could affect recently redrawn district maps in other states, which could in turn affect the balance of power in the House of Representatives. You can read more about these gerrymandering cases at the Brennan Center for Justice: Allen v. Milligan: Gerrymandering at the Supreme Court (Formerly Merrill v. Milligan) and Redistricting Litigation Roundup.

                  <p>In roughly the time it took you to read this sentence, Max Park solved a Rubik&#x27;s Cube. With his time of 3.13 seconds, Park bested Yusheng Du&#x27;s 2018 mark of 3.47 seconds. Just watch the video above...it&#x27;s ridiculous. I love how the judge comes in to preserve the scene as everyone goes bananas.
Park was one of the subjects of the excellent documentary, The Speed Cubers (trailer).

                  <p>NASA keeps the original film negatives from the Apollo program sealed in a frozen vault in Houston, TX and rarely grants access to them. As a result, nearly all of the photos we see of those historic missions were made decades ago or are copies of copies. Recently, the film was cleaned and digitally scanned at &quot;an unprecedented resolution&quot;.
Using these new high-res scans, image specialist Andy Saunders remastered each of the 35,000 photographs, resulting in this incredible-looking book, Apollo Remastered: The Ultimate Photographic Record. From the book&#x27;s website:
The photographs from the lunar surface are as close as we can get to standing on the Moon ourselves, and for the first time, we were able to look back at Earth from afar, experiencing the &quot;overview effect&quot; — the cognitive shift that elicits an intense emotional experience upon seeing our home planet from space for the first time. The &quot;Blue Marble&quot; photograph, taken as Apollo 17 set course for the Moon, depicts the whole sunlit Earth, and is the most reproduced photograph of all time. Along with Apollo 8&#x27;s &quot;Earthrise,&quot; which depicts Earth above the lunar horizon, it was a catalyst for the environmental movement that continues today.


Saunders is also selling prints of some of these remastered photos, which look absolutely stunning.

                  <p>I was totally fascinated by this look at the absurd logistics of concert tours and now have a newfound appreciation for all the people involved who collaborate to make the magic happen (and perhaps also a little bit more forgiving about the high price of tickets (but Ticketmaster can still go to hell)).
Now, to an outsider, the load out process might look chaotic, and the pace of the tour may seem unsustainable or unmanageable. But though grueling and exhaustingly complicated, these massive, nation-wide tours function remarkably smoothly considering the variety of variables.

                  <p>After 14-year-old Preston Mutanga&#x27;s Lego version of the trailer for Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse (embedded above) went viral, the team hired him to animate a short Lego sequence for the actual film.
In the brief scene, we see a Lego version of Peter Parker as he observes a dimensional anomaly and sneaks off to the Daily Bugle&#x27;s bathroom to alert another Spider-Man about the issue. While the scene is short, it killed in my theater and it also looked as good as anything in the recent Lego films. After seeing it, a few friends of mine even commented that it must have been the same team that animated it. But nope! It was a lone teenager, actually.


You can check out more of Mutanga&#x27;s work on his YouTube channel.

                  <p>In 1979, just a few short years before she hit it big as a pop artist, Madonna was in a post-punk rock band called The Breakfast Club — she sang and played the drums. In the video above, the band rips through four demo songs in just over 8 minutes. From Dangerous Minds, some context:
Hardcore fans will also know Madonna has been known to perform versions of these songs (and other early material) live. Here&#x27;s the thing — much like the early days of the Go-Go&#x27;s, Madonna is definitely flexing her affinity for punk rock while mixing it with her own brand of spirited pop which the entire world would soon embrace and others would emulate. Now, if you&#x27;ve never heard this version of Madonna, and dig your punk with a side of pop, you are going to love these raw jams. It&#x27;s also quite compelling to hear them, knowing what was to come from Madonna in a few short years.

                  <p>The Atlas of the United States Printed for the Use of the Blind, published in 1837 before Braille was widely used, used embossed printing of lines, words, and symbols to be finger-readable.

Without a drop of ink in the book, the text and maps in this extraordinary atlas were embossed heavy paper with letters, lines, and symbols. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first atlas produced for the blind to read without the assistance of a sighted person. Braille was invented by 1825, but was not widely used until later. It represented letters well, but could not represent shapes and cartographic features.

                  <p>Icelandic filmmaker Jón Karl Helgason has made a film called Sundlaugasögur (Swimming Pool Stories) about the central role of the swimming pool in Icelandic life. The trailer is above. From Fatherly:
The swimming pool is first and foremost a communal space. &quot;The swimming pool is your second home,&quot; Helgason says. &quot;You are brought up in the swimming pool.&quot; There may be only 160, or so, swimming pools in the entire country (which is roughly 305 miles wide by 105 miles long), but every one of them is the essential social hub of a community, large or small.
The swimming pool is a public utility — as critical as the grocery store or the bank. &quot;The British go to the pub, the French go to the cafes — in our culture, you meet in the swimming pool,&quot; says Helgason. Swimmers come from all walks of life, from farmers to artists to clergymen to celebrities. &quot;You can have 10, 15, 20, 30 people [in the pool] — they&#x27;re talking about politics and about their lives.&quot;

                  <p>Astronomers believe that there&#x27;s a black hole at the center of almost every large galaxy in the universe. Some of those black holes are particularly energetic, chewing up the galaxies in which they reside and releasing massive amounts of energy out into the cosmos. Those black holes and the energy emitted from matter and gas falling towards their centers are what astronomers call quasars.
But if we look closely, we see who is actually in charge. Small as a grain of sand compared to the filaments, the centers of some of these galaxies shine with the power of a trillion stars, blasting out huge jets of matter, completely reshaping the cosmos around them. Quasars, the single most powerful objects in existence, so powerful that they can kill a galaxy.

                  <p>FotoAutomat restores vintage analog photo booths and redeploys them around Europe, mostly in Paris.
There are less than fifty working analog photo booths remaining in the world now. Since 2007, FotoAutomat has been working to preserve this photographic heritage by restoring and maintaining the last original analog photobooths in Paris, Nantes and Prague, mainly in spaces dedicated to art and culture.

                  <p>For the New Yorker, Louisa Thomas on major league pitcher Daniel Bard, who has struggled with the yips on and off during his career.
Many baseball players have minor control issues at one point or another. Sometimes it happens after an injury, when a player is relearning how to throw, over-attending to discrete motions that used to feel fluid and natural. &quot;Overthinking&quot; is the simple way to put it: the brain&#x27;s prefrontal cortex trips up the sensory cortex and the motor cortex. In other cases, the mind can essentially go blank. Players usually snap out of it, the way Bard had years before. But the brain can get stuck in certain patterns, and the yips can take over in a way that no one fully understands.

                  <p>We did it again, internet
If you’ll recall, once upon a time I managed to get my Wii Balance Board to connect to my computer and function as a scale.
At some point throughout the years, Linux changed, and that method broke.
It would still measure your weight fine, but you could no longer activate the balance board by tapping its front button, you had to flip it over, remove the battery compartment lid and press the red button every time.
This was too much of a hassle, so I stopped using the board, hoping that a solution to this problem would arrive one day to liberate me from the scourge of adipose tissue.
This day is today (well, a few months ago, actually, but I couldn’t be arsed writing about it until today, so).
I received an email from a reader called Jawaad Mahmood, who had read my balance board article and spent a bit of time figuring out how to get the balance board to work, and packaged his work into a library called bbev.
I was initially sceptical because many people contacted me throughout the years, but nobody managed to get rid of the red button requirement.
Talking to Jawaad for a bit, though, he confirmed that he could painlessly get the board to pair with his computer with the front button.
Apparently something had changed in the Linux Bluetooth stack, and made pairing possible again, and he managed to figure out how.
This was great news!

                  <p>I love Passkeys so much
I am unreasonably excited about Passkeys, I’ve long been looking for a better/more convenient way than passwords to do authentication, and I think Passkeys are finally it.
However, whenever I see Passkeys mentioned (for example on the recent Tailscale post about them), there are always a lot of misconceptions that surface in the debate.
I’d like to clear some of them here, and hopefully explain a bit better what Passkeys are.
A bit of backstory
Passkeys are a user-friendly name for, and an implementation of WebAuthn, which in turn is part of the FIDO2 project.
All that is basically a way to say that Passkeys are an open standard, developed by a consortium of companies that want to make authentication more secure and more usable.
My personal opinion is that Passkeys are a great solution to that problem, and that’s why I’m so excited about them.
At their core, Passkeys are just a way for a website to ask your browser for authentication.
That’s it, they aren’t tied to a specific piece of hardware or a way for that hardware to work.
I’ll expound more on this further on.
I want to lay out some common misconceptions about Passkeys that I’ve been seeing, and</p>

                  <p>Noh is a classical Japanese art of dramatic dance that&#x27;s been performed since the 14th century. The masks worn by characters are an art form in themselves, and in this video, an expert craftsperson carves a noh mask out of a single block of Japanese cypress and then paints it with pigments made from crushed seashells.
I love the look of the rough texture of the mask when she&#x27;s about halfway through, before she smoothes it out with the paint — it&#x27;s like IRL low-poly. But the detail of the finished product is incredible.

                  <p>If you watch the video above of a front-facing camera on a moving train, the train appears to move much faster in the zoomed out view than in the zoomed in view. Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s going on:
The illusion that speed decreases when zoomed is &quot;because when one focuses on an inner portion of the movie, the optic flow angular speed is slow, and appears to fill one&#x27;s entitle visual field, which is consistent with overall lower forward speed.
Note: The more zoomed, the more densely packed the overhead rigging appears. So, even though you appear to be moving forward more slowly when zoomed in, the actual rate of rigging flowing by remains constant, consistent with same forward speed in all conditions.

Instead of the familiar yellow, Doran has chosen to outfit our star in vivid blue and black, which lends the video a sort of alien familiarity. This looks absolutely stunning in 4K.

                  <p>Yesterday I posted a link to a Twitter thread by Stanley Kubrick scholar Filippo Ulivieri about a previously overlooked (*ahem*) aspect of The Shining: Jack Nicholson breaks the fourth wall by micro-glancing at the camera dozens of times during the film. It turns out that Ulivieri also made a visual essay about this and it&#x27;s really worth a watch.
Let&#x27;s go back to that glance that has been noticed by a few film critics. Some say it&#x27;s a Brechtian effect to expose the artifice of the mise en scène and have the audience reflect on the film medium. But Kubrick&#x27;s films are not intellectual, despite what the critics say. &quot;The truth of a thing,&quot; Kubrick said, &quot;is in the feel of it, not in the think of it.&quot; If this look at the camera means anything, for me it means that we are not safe from Jack&#x27;s …</p>

I used to do December holiday gift guides and really enjoyed the process, so this is me dipping my toe back into the gift guide water after a three-year absence.
Note: if you&#x27;re shopping for a fishing/hunting/golfing dad, this list might not be that useful. Read on if your dad is a tech/design/culture dork like me — this is all stuff I wouldn&#x27;t mind getting or already own myself.
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom for Nintendo Switch. This game has gotten such good reviews that the only thing holding me back from getting it is the knowledge that I have other things in my life that I cannot completely neglect for the next three weeks.

Golden Girls &#x3D; Elderly Sex and the City
Some of these would make pretty good Midjourney prompts but I will leave that as an exercise to the reader.1

Mostly because I&#x27;ve never had the patience to figure out the Rube Goldbergian process for using Midjourney. Step 1: sign up for an account on a gamers chat app??! No thank you.↩

The top prize winner is this working model of Platform 9 3/4 from the Harry Potter books:

One of my favorites is The Poggendorff Triangles, which goes to show you that straight lines aren&#x27;t always straight:

Here&#x27;s an audio illusion that sounds as though the tempo is endlessly rising (similar to the Shepard tone):

And then there&#x27;s this hollow face illusion in which this woman&#x27;s face looks at you as you move around her:

                  <p>A few years ago I gave a short talk (slides)
about myths that discourage people from blogging. I was chatting with a friend
about blogging the other day and it made me want to write up that talk as a
blog post.
here are the myths:
myth: you need to be original
myth: you need to be an expert
myth: posts need to be 100% correct
myth: writing boring posts is bad
myth: you need to explain every concept
myth: page views matter
myth: more material is always better
myth: you need to be original
This is probably the one I hear the most often – “Someone has written about
this before! Who’s going to care about what I have to say?“.
The main way I think about this personally is:
identify something I personally have found confusing or interesting
write about it
The idea is that if I found it confusing…</p>

                  <p>To effectively combat the climate crisis, we&#x27;re going to need to remove carbon from the atmosphere. But what&#x27;s the best way to do it? Two of the main solutions being considered are direct carbon capture technology and growing trees and each approach has its pros and cons.
Carbon removal is a catch-all term for anything that people do that pulls CO2 out of the air and stores it somewhere else. To meet the world&#x27;s climate goals, we would need to do this on a massive scale — anywhere from 440 billion to 1.1 trillion metric tons before the end of the century. That&#x27;s more carbon than the U.S. has emitted in its entire history.
So how do we remove all that carbon? There are two carbon removal ideas that have really captured the conversation. One is direct air capture, which involves big factories that suck in tons of CO2 from the atmosphere, chemically concentrate it, and store it deep in the ground. The other idea is to simply plant trees! After all, trees have naturally sequestered carbon for millions of years.

Written and &quot;Directed&quot; by Paul Trillo.


Kyle Chayka talked to Trillo about his process for the New Yorker:
Trillo demonstrated the process to me during a Zoom call; in seconds, it was possible to render, for example, a tracking shot of a woman crying alone in a softly lit restaurant. His prompt included a hash of S.E.O.-esque terms meant to goad the machine into creating a particularly cinematic aesthetic: &quot;Moody lighting, iconic, visually stunning, immersive, impactful.&quot; Trillo was enthralled by the process: &quot;The speed in which I could operate was unlike anything I had experienced.&quot; He continued, &quot;It felt like being able to fly in a dream.&quot; The A.I. tool was &quot;co-directing&quot; alongside him: &quot;It&#x27;s making a lot of decisions I didn&#x27;t.&quot;

                  <p>I recently did an interview about speed running Monkey Island (I&#x27;ll post a link when it&#x27;s available).
One of the topics was how speed runners dislike random events and the end of Monkey Island 2 has a lot of randomness around when LeChuck appears. I was asked how this worked and to be honest that was a long time ago and I don&#x27;t remember every little scape of code. It is also possible that I didn&#x27;t write it.  But what I do have is the SCUMM source code for Monkey Island 2 and I tracked down the code.
lechuck-appearance-chance is 4
lechuck-appearance-interval is 300
times-lechucks-appeared-recently +&#x3D; 1
foo &#x3D; (3 - times-lechucks-appeared-recently)
foo &#x3D; (random foo)
if (!foo) {     ; after he&#x27;s popped up a couple times he&#x27;s likely to disappear for a while
    times-lechucks-appeared-recently &#x3D; 0
    lechuck-appearance-chance is 10 ; that is, 1 in 10
    lechuck-appearance-interval is 500
}
if (magic-doll) {   ; speed him way up after you make the doll
    if (owner-of needle is selected-actor) {    ; and have the needle
        lechuck-appearance-chance is 2
        lechuck-appearance-interval is 120
    }
}
There are some other random conditions about what item you picked up last, etc, but this is the core of it.
P.S. If you&#x27;re wondering my SCUMM uses - in variable names, it&#x27;s because it started out as a variant of LISP.
P.P.S. It&#x27;s also worth noting that this is for the original MI2, The special editions and SCUMMVM might have changed how this works.</p>

I did not mean to let this much time elapse since the last installment of my media diet, all the way back on Dec 2 in a completely different calendar year.

Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been watching, reading, listening to, and experiencing over the last six months. Enjoy.

Fire of Love. Superb documentary on volcanos and obsession. The footage, mostly shot by the subjects, is unbelievable. (A)
Star Trek: First Contact. Maybe my favorite Star Trek movie? Ok, maybe not favorite but I like it a lot. (A)
Splendor. This is one of my favorite engine-building games that I&#x27;ve played — it strips the concept down to the bare bones. That makes it easy to …</p>

                  <p>In this short video from the BBC narrated by Helena Bonham Carter, activist and actor George Takei talks about his imprisonment in an American concentration camp during WWII because he was of Japanese descent.
I began school in Rohwer, a real school, in a black tar paper barrack. There was an American flag hanging at the front of the classroom and on the first morning, the teacher said, &quot;We&#x27;re going begin every morning with the pledge of allegiance to the flag. I will teach it to you and you are to memorize that.&quot; But I could see right outside my schoolhouse window the barbed wire fence and the sentry tower as I recited the words &quot;with liberty and justice for all&quot;. An innocent kid, too young to understand the stinging irony in those words.


Takei has done many talks &amp; interviews over the years about his experience, including for the Archive of American Television, Democracy Now!, and a TED Talk back in 2014:

He also published a graphic novel about his time in the camps called They Called Us Enemy.

                  <p>Capture the Atlas have announced their picks for the 2023 Milky Way Photographer of the Year competition. As usual, I&#x27;ve included a few of my favorites here — from top to bottom: Jakob Sahner&#x27;s photo from the Canary Islands, Mihail Minkov&#x27;s composite shot of the Milky Way as it looks in both the summer &amp; winter, and Steffi Lieberman amongst the baobab trees in Madagascar. Here&#x27;s Minkov explaining his full-galactic view:
I&#x27;ve always wondered what the night sky would look like if we could see the two Milky Way arches from the winter and summer side by side. This is practically impossible, since they are part of a whole and are visible at different times of the day.
However, this 360-degree time-blended panorama shows us what they would look like. The two arches of the Milky Way represent one object in the starry sky, with part of it visible in winter and part of it in summer. Therefore, they are called the winter and summer arches. The winter arch includes objects that we can observe from October to March, primarily associated with the constellation Orion.
On the other hand, the summer arch features the Milky Way core, visible from March to September, which is the most characteristic and luminous part of the night sky, representing the center of our galaxy.

                  <p>Ok this is kind of incredible: Brick Technology built a solar-powered Lego clock that will keep time for a billion years. It&#x27;s got various displays in the style of an astronomical clock so you can keep track of seconds, hours, months, centuries, and even galactical years (the amount of time the Sun takes to orbit the center of the galaxy). The clock is powered by solar energy, and the solar cell is connected to the clock so that it tilts throughout the day to keep facing the sun. 
This is a) an extremely accessible explanation of how clocks work, b) the nerdiest thing ever, and c) I love it so much. Even if you&#x27;re not a Lego fan, you should watch this. (For more on how clocks work, check out Bartosz Ciechanowski&#x27;s excellent explainer on mechanical watches.)
The obvious thing that sprung to mind watching this was The Clock of the Long Now, a 10,000-year clock being constructed inside a mountain in West Texas. But I also thought of Arthur Ganson&#x27;s Machine With Concrete, which utilizes extreme gear ratios to turn an input of 200 rpm into a gear that turns only once every 2 trillion years. That&#x27;s slow enough that the final gear is actually embedded in concrete and it doesn&#x27;t affect the operation of the machine at all.

                  <p>Hey everyone! This is the list of all the changes we&#x27;ve done to our projects and apps during the month of June. We&#x27;ll also be reporting in our on position in the world, and on our future plans.
Summary Of Changes
100r.co, added propeller maintenance, Maple Bay, Telegraph Cove, Smuggler Cove and Princess Louisa Inlet.
Wiktopher, added back the revised/corrected version of Chapter 10, back online, and Chapter 11 has been corrected but is not yet live.
UxnFor, created an uxntal code formatter.
Bicycle, added lots of little improvements.
Adelie, added speaker&#x27;s notes and a pen mode.
News
Pino spent the first few days of the month on land, having its bottom re-painted, and its various bits serviced and checked. We took our propeller apart for the first time.
We&#x27;ve added a few write-ups of our travels so far (see above entry with links under 100r.co), but the most significant one is our 46nmi sail up to Princess Louisa Inlet, a long fjord on British Columbia&#x27;s Sunshine Coast, with an incredible gem at the end. It is an amazing, and unique place. We&#x27;re glad we finally got to go. As we write this, we are in Roscoe Bay on West Redonda Island, tethering off a phone hoisted up the mast (it works quite well).
This summer we are power stable. We had issues last year because of parisitic draws due to old wiring (see DC electrical refit), but now everything is working as it should. We&#x27;re charging our computers without an inverter, and that too is working out quite well so far (see charging electronics).
Together, Hikari and Lynn made chibicc-uxn, a c compiler for Uxn, and with it also released a port of the classic software Neko(xneko, oneko sakura).

It&#x27;s amazing how much Swarbrick&#x27;s illustrations communicate with so few strokes...Mourinho&#x27;s face is my favorite. Here&#x27;s the actual match for comparison purposes. And here&#x27;s Maradona&#x27;s sublime goal against England in the 1986 World Cup (original video):

You can find many other examples of Swarbrick&#x27;s work on his web site and on his YouTube channel. (via @dunstan)

                  <p>In 2015, artist Olafur Eliasson designed the Circle Bridge (Cirkelbroen) to span a canal in central Copenhagen. The pedestrian bridge was designed to slow people down a bit:
The bridge is made of five circular platforms, and it contributes to a larger circle that will form a pedestrian route around Copenhagen Harbour, where people — cycling, running, walking — can see the city from a very different perspective. As many as 5,000 people will cross this bridge each day. I hope that these people will use Cirkelbroen as a meeting place, and that the zigzag design of the bridge will make them reduce their speed and take a break. To hesitate on our way is to engage in bodily thought. I see such introspection as an essential part of a vibrant city.


Small boats can travel easily under the bridge but a section of the bridge also swings gracefully away to let larger boats pass. (via greg allen)

                  <p>In a Memorial Day reflection, historian Heather Cox Richardson highlights a pamphlet distributed by the US War Department to Army soldiers during World War II on the topic of fascism: what it is and how to combat it.
The War Department thought it was important for Americans to understand the tactics fascists would use to take power in the United States. They would try to gain power &quot;under the guise of &#x27;super-patriotism&#x27; and &#x27;super-Americanism.&#x27;&quot; And they would use three techniques:
First, they would pit religious, racial, and economic groups against one another to break down national unity. Part of that effort to divide and conquer would be a &quot;well-planned &#x27;hate campaign&#x27; against minority races, religions, and other groups.&quot;
Second, they would deny any need for international cooperation, because that would fly in the face of their insistence that their supporters were better than everyone else. &quot;In place of international cooperation, the fascists seek to substitute a perverted sort of ultra-nationalism which tells their people that they are the only people in the world who count. With this goes hatred and suspicion toward the people of all other nations.&quot;
Third, fascists would insist that &quot;the world has but two choices — either fascism or communism, and they label as &#x27;communists&#x27; everyone who refuses to support them.&quot;
It is &quot;vitally important&quot; to learn to spot native fascists, the government said, &quot;even though they adopt names and slogans with popular appeal, drape themselves with the American flag, and attempt to carry out their program in the name of the democracy they are trying to destroy.&quot;

                  <p>The Inouye Solar Telescope is the largest and most powerful solar telescope in the world. The telescope is still in a &quot;learning and transitioning period&quot; and not up to full operational speed, but scientists at the National Solar Observatory recently released a batch of images that hint at what it&#x27;s capable of. Several of the photos feature sunspots, cooler regions of the Sun with strong magnetic fields.
The sunspots pictured are dark and cool regions on the Sun&#x27;s &quot;surface&quot;, known as the photosphere, where strong magnetic fields persist. Sunspots vary in size, but many are often the size of Earth, if not larger. Complex sunspots or groups of sunspots can be the source of explosive events like flares and coronal mass ejections that generate solar storms. These energetic and eruptive phenomena influence the outermost atmospheric layer of the Sun, the heliosphere, with the potential to impact Earth and our critical infrastructure.
In the quiet regions of the Sun, the images show convection cells in the photosphere displaying a bright pattern of hot, upward-flowing plasma (granules) surrounded by darker lanes of cooler, down-flowing solar plasma. In the atmospheric layer above the photosphere, called the chromosphere, we see dark, elongated fibrils originating from locations of small-scale magnetic field accumulations.

                  <p>Slightly branching out from the usual western handhelds, I&#x27;ve seen WonderSwans but never played around. Then managed to pick up a faulty &quot;Color&quot; model for £40 on eBay listed as not working.
On inspection it looked, internally, very clean - no corrosion or damage. From my experience with Pokémon Mini handhelds, I was wondering if perhaps the power button wasn&#x27;t getting the signal.
So I applied a slice of kitchen tin foil, some sticky tape and voilà, it powers up! I had to also apply it to the sound and start button (and I&#x27;ll probably make this permanent with conductive paint one day), but otherwise it&#x27;s all good.
(And I snagged a flash cart so I was able to experience some translated romhacks too)</p>

                  <p>Cutting to the chase: text editors *and* tabs vs. spaces!  Ooooh!


I&#x27;ve had this thing called &quot;e&quot; for a while now.  It&#x27;s a stupid little 
script which serves to do a couple of things.  It starts my 
editor
with a given file, and it kicks it with the right arguments to make it 
disable line wrapping and to make the [TAB] key actually put in two 
spaces.


So, my dumb script would use &quot;-w -E -T 2&quot; most of the time, except when it 
was running on a Makefile, at which point it would skip those args.  
Simple enough, right?


pico is back?  Yes indeed, on Macs, as of 12.3, pico is in fact back.  To 
make sure I wasn&#x27;t imagining things, I tracked down a machine that hadn&#x27;t 
been upgraded yet and checked there.  Sure enough, it was in fact nano and 
not pico.


macOS 12.3 has nano as a symlink... pointing to pico!


At some point, I switched from literal tab characters in my source code to 
blobs of spaces, probably due to using that style at work and not hating 
it.  So, somewhere along the line I actually started depending on nano 
behavior without realizing it.


As for the lack of a feature in pico itself, it&#x27;s kind of strange, really.  
If you go digging into the source, they have this random.c with a function 
called tab which claims to &quot;simulate tab stop&quot; using spaces.  That said, I 
can&#x27;t find any place where it would be called with the magic values which 
would make it behave that way.


It wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if this switch is just more of Apple removing 
GPLed things from their OS - pico seems to use the Apache license.  They 
dumped bash for zsh (MIT license) at some point (Big Sur, I think), and 
now this?  Okay then.</p>

                  <p>Here&#x27;s a very old and stupid trick you could do with some filesystems in 
some situations back in the day... and might still be able to do in a 
few places today.


The problem is that while version X might eventually have an exploit, 
it&#x27;ll get removed and it&#x27;ll be replaced by version Y without that
particular hole.  By the time you get your hands on a tool to break into 
X, it&#x27;ll be gone.


What you&#x27;d do is create a hard link pointing at the file you wanted to 
preserve, storing it in a spot which was writable by your account.  
Then, say, /usr/bin/sudo (because that never has security 
issues...) gets replaced at some point with a new file and you get to 
keep the old version.  When you get the tool to pop it, off you go!


Of course, these days, it&#x27;s not quite so easy on the more modern systems 
you find.  Debian 11 here won&#x27;t let me do it - it&#x27;s EPERM city.  Rocky 8 
(so CentOS 8 and RHEL 8 too) also won&#x27;t do it.  They both have some gunk
in /usr/lib/sysctl.d to lock this down.  But, my old Slackware 14.2 
install of my workstation let me do it the last time I tried about 
a year ago.  How about that, huh?  I bet it&#x27;d still work if I dug out 
the old drives and booted them up.


Incidentally, this is the magic sauce: /proc/sys/fs/protected_hardlinks
Read the man page for proc(5) to learn more about it.

here it is,
the thread I read a long time ago.  It&#x27;s interesting to note that as far 
as I can tell, nothing actually changed upstream.  This left paranoid 
admins like me with no option but to use the (most excellent) Openwall 
patches to lock down this kind of stuff.  I used that on my machines at 
work which had non-staff users... just in case.


This whole situation is scary.

                  <p>Back in January, you might have seen my
post
about a very large BBS which seemed to solve for the problem of &quot;how do 
we host a bunch of users&quot; by having one physical box per user.  It might 
have been one physical box per *two* users, maybe, but it&#x27;s hard to say.


Now, keep in mind digital cameras weren&#x27;t easy to come by, so I have 
very few actual pictures.  I&#x27;ll have to do a lot of explaining to make 
up for the lack of detail and alternate angles.  Clearly, I had no 
notion of ever using these pictures to tell stories 25+ years later.


Some friends at a local company had some bandwidth to spare (a T1 to 
Alternet somewhere, as I recall), so they parked a Zoom modem on one of 
their boxes and plugged it into a phone line.  We got an identical model 
to avoid cross-brand issues (Zoom m…</p>

                  <p>I sometimes write the beginnings of posts but don&#x27;t post them.  I still 
save them in case conditions change or other things happen and make me 
want to follow up on the topic.  In this case, I wrote something about 
offices before the whole COVID lockdown thing happened and people 
largely stopped going to offices every day.  With that in mind, let&#x27;s 
proceed.


However, tech companies decided to go past this at some point and 
brought about this whole notion of &quot;microkitchens&quot;.  This is where 
they&#x27;d put their branding on the coolers (instead of &quot;Coca-Cola&quot; or 
&quot;Pepsi&quot;) and would load it up with every kind of fizzy sugary liquid 
they could get their hands on.  They&#x27;d have racks and racks of shelving 
packed with all sorts of interesting crunchy, sugary and carb-loaded 
snacks.  They&#x27;d a…</p>

                  <p>One of the fun things I used to do at a prior job was to dig through the 
raw data points which were collected from the *many* servers we had.  I 
could just pick an interesting-sounding metric and then would just ask 
the system to show me the top 10 or bottom 10 out of a population of 
thousands or more.


To get my feet wet with the whole &quot;investigations&quot; thing that we&#x27;d do, I 
started looking into this one day and chose one of the many temp sensors 
which were being logged by the servers.  I forget exactly which one it 
was, for there were many.  The CPUs logged it, the chassis logged it, 
the power supply logged it, and so on.  There were so many choices.


I went looking for a reason.  What could possibly explain this?  First 
off, it didn&#x27;t line up with any obvious pattern in the host names.  The 
hosts were named for whichever team owned them, followed by a sequence 
number that was bumped any time a new one was provisioned.  There was no 
signal to be found in that.


There was more, though.  You could also see a &quot;rack position&quot; in this 
data, and now it started getting interesting.  It seems that all of the 
really hot machines had a rack position of something low, like 04 or 05, 
and never anything higher than that.  In fact, when looking at a whole 
rack, it was always the lowest number of all of the positions that were 
being used.  Now this was worth chasing!


It&#x27;s good that I asked, since they told me something surprising: 
position 04 or 05 or whatever was the *bottom* of the rack.  Yes, 
somehow, the lowest machine in the rack was the hottest!  They found 
this interesting, too, and wound up digging into it.  Given that I was 
far away in a distant office, this was the best way for us to proceed.


The problem was that the bottommost server would have nothing below it 
but just open space until it got to the floor.  That space would not 
move air efficiently, and it obviously mattered.


This rolled out and my hot spots disappeared.  Fantastic!</p>

                  <p>Another day, another bit of local flavor, but this time it&#x27;s something I 
wish I didn&#x27;t have to write about.

wrote
about seeing a maintenance truck rolling down the Caltrain line in 
Mountain View.  It had a special attachment to let it stay on the rails.  
At no point did the arms come down for the crossing.  It managed to 
approach, then the people inside looked around and went through, and the 
arms never budged.  There were no flashing lights or bells.




caught fire.  A bunch of people were hurt.  More were shaken 
up.


I&#x27;m assuming their construction trucks don&#x27;t trigger the &quot;short the 
rails together to signal various things&quot; logic, either.  This would 
mean that crossing arms stay up... and I have to assume it also means 
the signals along the way stay green instead of going red.

We will presumably hear more about whatever the signals said, and 
whether the train went past a red signal or not.  I just have a bad 
feeling that they saw a green and kept on going.</p>

                  <p>Here&#x27;s a little bit of Silicon Valley local flavor for a change.  We 
have this freeway that runs from San Jose to San Francisco called US 
101, or around here, just &quot;101&quot;.  (Southern California has it too, but 
they call it &quot;the&quot; 101.  That&#x27;s how we detect invaders.)  Anyway, this 
thing is usually eight or more lanes up and down the peninsula, and it&#x27;s 
had a &quot;diamond&quot; or car pool lane on the #1 (innermost/&quot;fast&quot;) lane for 
many years.  You had to have a certain number of people in the car (or 
some other conditions met) during certain hours (AM and PM rush, 
weekdays), or you&#x27;d be in for a hefty ticket.


How does the system know what to charge you?  Well, you either have an 
old-style toll transponder that always bills you as a solo driver, or 
you have a new-style transponder with a 1/2/3+ switch that tells the 
road how to handle you.


Think about what this does to enforcement.  Now, instead of just &quot;is 
there a vehicle in the lane&quot;, &quot;is it the right time during a weekday&quot;, 
and &quot;how many people are in the car&quot;, now it&#x27;s also a matter of &quot;do they 
have their transponder set properly&quot;.

                  <p>I already told a
story
about how you can hose your machine by pointing the Linux kernel at a 
custom core dump handler and then have that handler fail to function.  
This&#x27;ll clog up the pipe (really), and then everything else will just 
stack up behind it.  Pretty soon, every crashing process will be stuck 
just the same.


Once upon a time, in a big company environment, someone decided that 
they wanted to provide a service to other things running on the same 
Linux box.  But, instead of either writing Yet Another Service (tm) 
that would go through release processes and all of that good stuff, they 
went for a different design entirely.


There are so many problems with this.  You have the issue of a &quot;server&quot; 
that appears out of thin air depending on who or what starts first on

                  <p>If a web site makes an RSS or Atom feed available, it&#x27;s not a bad idea 
to poll it from time to time.  Actually doing that poll like a good 
netizen (remember that concept?) takes a little attention to detail.


Given the reality of the situation, does it make sense to poll every 10 
seconds?  Probably not, right?  Someone set up something like that and 
left it running for a couple of months until I finally noticed it and 
dealt with it myself.


Given this, you can keep track of the &quot;Last-Modified&quot; header when you 
get a copy of the feed.  Then, you can turn around and use that same 
value in an &quot;If-Modified-Since&quot; header the next time you come to look 
for an update.  If nothing&#x27;s changed, the web server will notice it&#x27;s 
the same as what it already has, and it&#x27;ll send you a HTTP 304 co…</p>

                  <p>Here&#x27;s a concept: &quot;ssh to prod and edit directly on the machine&quot; is 
generally bad news.


I should point out that I didn&#x27;t know this person and had no idea how 
they would respond to such feedback - it might have been fine!  They 
might be a well-adjusted person who can take a request like that and not 
turn it around into a full-on nuclear attack.  But, I didn&#x27;t know either 
way.


At some point, I actually had a meeting with this developer for some 
other reason, and what happened was kind of amazing.  First thing, he 
brought it up and asked me about it.  I said something like, &quot;well, I 
didn&#x27;t want to get into it, but since you asked&quot;, and proceeded into 
something along the lines of &quot;obviously it would be best if you didn&#x27;t 
do that - sshing in and twiddling Python files on the actual production 
AWS instance of the service&quot;.


&quot;But... I suspect you are doing it for some reason?&quot;


My response was... I hope... reasonable: &quot;So as much as I would love to 
say &#x27;don&#x27;t do that!!!&#x27;, I&#x27;m not going to stand in the way of you 
literally doing your job.  So please proceed with care, and keep an eye 
open for some day when (first dumb thing) and (second dumb thing) aren&#x27;t 
problems any more and you need not do this any more.&quot;


It was either &quot;edit in prod&quot; or endure DAY LONG development cycles: make 
a change, wait 24 hours, come back tomorrow, and try it again.  That&#x27;s 
how broken it was.


The best part about this was that we had a totally reasonable 
conversation about it.  It&#x27;s the kind of thing which had become a rare 
commodity in those days at that place.


Would I expect someone else to go to that level of insanity every single 
time they just want to get their job done?  Absolutely not.

Editing files in prod to develop them?  That&#x27;s bad news.  Deliberately 
rigging tunnels to spoof a connection from prod?  That&#x27;s also bad news.  
Having to do them to get your job done?  You might be in the bad place.</p>

                  <p>Quite a while back, I wrote a post that basically went like this: if 
someone has a problem with someone else or something that person is 
doing, they&#x27;re going to find a way to get to &quot;no&quot;.  They will find some 
reason, some excuse, or some problem with it.  They&#x27;ll bring up a point 
and you&#x27;ll show that this is not in fact a thing.  They will then pivot 
again and again.


But, as I said, that was back then, and this time I&#x27;m talking about 
something else: when it happens in person with a coworker.  I had an 
experience like this a few years back, and figured I&#x27;d share how it goes 
for the sake of others who might not have encountered it yet, or who 
have and thought they were alone in this.

                  <p>This is a short one since it&#x27;s somewhere between a random bit of 
&quot;grab some popcorn&quot; amusement and a &quot;huh, that might be a problem some 
day&quot;.  In short, it looks like every Raspberry Pi filesystem installed 
from any given release image probably ends up with the same
UUID.


For instance, if you downloaded the &quot;lite&quot; version of Raspbian between 
roughly November 8th and January 28th, you probably got a file called 
2021-10-30-raspios-bullseye-armhf-lite.zip.  Inside, there&#x27;s an image, 
and the idea is that you dump that straight to your SD card, cram it in 
the Pi, and off you go.  The second partition on that image is an ext4 
filesystem which was created on some build machine somewhere.  The UUID 
on it never gets &quot;evolved&quot; to something else after the install.


You can see it inside the image itself here:


Or, if you actually installed a few of these things like I did over the 
past couple of months, you can just &#x27;tune2fs -l /dev/mmcblk0p2&#x27; and see 
the same value in there.


Don&#x27;t end up with a pile of SD cards on your desk and think &quot;I know, 
I&#x27;ll use the filesystem UUIDs to track which one goes where&quot;, in other 
words.


If it&#x27;s not breaking anything for you, it&#x27;s probably best to just let it 
be.  Untangling a boot mess on these weird little boxes is anything but 
fun.

Note: if you&#x27;re actually on a recent Raspberry Pi, odds are good that 
your /etc/fstab will be using *partition* UUIDs (PARTUUID&#x3D;...) and not 
those of the filesystem.  If in doubt, use blkid to see what&#x27;s what.</p>

This is actually a story about somewhere I used to work, and someone who 
was on one of my teams back in the day.  One day, I heard that one of 
the people in a far-away office had created some kind of tool that would 
let you look at the status of different machines - that is, Linux boxes. 
I don&#x27;t remember the finer points of it or why this person even 
bothered, but they…</p>

                  <p>There are some interesting implications to the way that you have to 
handle references to other bits of code when you write a C++ header 
file.  There are things you can do which turn out to be suboptimal, and 
until or unless you work someplace with a coding style document or get 
some mentor who&#x27;s already been there, you&#x27;re likely to make some
mistakes.


Anyway, a common way to do this is to set up the outer class such that 
it has a pointer to the inner one.  You *could* have it just own it 
directly, but then that introduces problems.

  Bar bar_;



Of course, bar.h probably has its own dependencies which get #included, 
and so now you end up with this evil web of slow compiles.  It sucks.


What used to happen next is that someone would say, okay, let&#x27;s make it

                  <p>Yesterday, I
put forth
a bunch of API possibilities for the problem of needing to return a 
value but also indicating the lack of a value and being able to comment 
on why.  In it, the notion of a &quot;wrapper&quot; around a string was presented, 
such that it might look like &quot;Result&quot;, and those brackets 
started looking like a pain.  There was also the possibility of having 
something like &quot;ResultString&quot;, but didn&#x27;t that open the door to having a 
bunch of code duplication?


After this had existed for a while, the general happy feeling of having 
this stuff in place became infectious.  I wanted it to cover other 
things with it, too.  I wanted it to handle something a bit more 
complicated than a mere string, and so decided to try my hand at the 
template-wrangling metaprogramming cruft t…</p>

                  <p>If you agree with the notion that you need to be able to tell the 
difference between the absence of a value and a value itself, then this 
has some impacts on the code you write.  If you want to keep &#x27;em 
separated (so they can come out and play), then it gets you looking at 
your API designs in certain ways.


Imagine we&#x27;re talking about a helper function that is intended to be run 
inside a program that&#x27;s handling the access to a web page.  It&#x27;s 
probably a CGI program, but it could also be buried inside some much 
bigger thing, too.  This is all about C++ styles, but you can probably 
see slices of other languages in here, too.

yesterday&#x27;s post,
I mentioned taking my old Mac Mini out of the OS X/macos ecosystem and 
bringing it into Debian, and then what kind of hilarity followed when I 
attempted to install a Javascript linter (and it tried to drag in 180+ 
node-related packages).

you have different tastes, then great, go with that&quot; definitely applies 
here.


First of all, the one that most people actually notice is the actual box 
which is serving rachelbythebay.com, which at the moment is a box called

do they ever really think about the implications of having hundreds of 
teeny little libraries, all moving independently?  This is how it 
manifests in the real world.


My relative inexperience with Debian systems means I&#x27;m constantly being 
delighted to discover that such and such has already been packaged up 
and is just an apt command away.  Things that I would have done by hand 
in the years up to this point now have someone else worrying about them.

has expanded.  Now it has a variant: 4740180.


Where does this one come from?  
Go and gRPC, apparently!


I found this while searching the web for &quot;1213486160&quot; to see how things 
have been going in the past few years.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s still biting 
people all over the place.  There are far too many posts asking people 
to upgrade their software, or restart things, or do any number of 
useless rubber-chicken-waving techniques which ultimately will 
accomplish nothing.

When you see a funny-looking number, figure out where it comes from.
That&#x27;s the only way to have any chance of understanding what&#x27;s actually 
going on.</p>

&quot;process infection&quot; story:

https://lwn.net/Articles/883547/):


If you do privileged execution of specific operations via IPC you get 
the guarantee that whatever is done, is done from a well-defined, 
pristine execution environment, without leaking context implicitly. The 
IPC message is the *full* vulnerable surface, and that&#x27;s as minimal as 
it can get. And that&#x27;s great.




Oh wow, thank you for mentioning that, unnamed reader!  I definitely 
read that post on LWN at some point in the past couple of days when the 
pkexec thing started going around.  It must have really worked its way 
into my head, and then eventually stirred up the memory of everything 
getting &quot;nicely infected&quot; at $OLD_JOB.

                  <p>I once worked at a place that had an interesting little problem stemming 
from the way they managed machines and some of the fun side-effects 
processes can have on each other.  This is back in the pre-systemd days 
of running services, such that things tended to be started or restarted 
by someone or something that itself ran as root.  That is, if you 
started something, it might inherit one or more things from your 
environment.  Likewise, if you ran something with an unusual 
environment, it might bestow those &quot;gifts&quot; onto anything it happened to 
touch.


After locking themselves out of machines too many times, people 
generally learned that after you mess with a glibc upgrade, you restart 
the sshd listener on port 22.  Of course, they also had to learn to not

in a post all by itself to give it a chance to &quot;sink in&quot; before I went 
and used it in an analogy.  First, I&#x27;ll just show the image and explain 
what you&#x27;re looking at here.




I do remember the description from the back: this is a picture of *part 
of* something that was called the Software Creations BBS.  It was a 
multi-line bulletin board system where you could dial up and send 
messages to people, upload and download files, and (presumably) play 
online games (&quot;doors&quot;) and anything else they cared to offer.

64 machines in a little space.  I have to assume 
they are at least 
286s (ATs, more or 
less), but it&#x27;s impossible to tell from just this picture.  They could 
have been 386s or even 486s by that point, but …</p>

                  <p>Okay, so yesterday I 
posted
a picture of an old multi-line bulletin board system which had 
apparently taken over an entire bedroom with dozens of computers.  I 
mentioned that I intended to come back to the topic to throw in my own 
two cents, and so here we go.


Or, were you someone who found it horrific and wished there was a 
simpler way?  Did you wonder if it would be possible to pack all of that 
into one or maybe two boxes, instead?  Did you want a way to negate all 
of that complexity while still providing the same level of service?


Now, things are different.  I look at that and just sigh at the lost 
opportunities.  The actual amount of work being done on behalf of any of 
the users who are connected is tiny.  If we ignore the fact that the 
actual BBS software and related acc…</p>
