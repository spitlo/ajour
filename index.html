                  <p>I just found out today that they made a movie version of Ian Frazier’s classic 1990 New Yorker piece Coyote V. Acme, in which Wile E. Coyote files a product liability lawsuit against the Acme Company.
Mr. Coyote states that on December 13th he received of Defendant via parcel post one Acme Rocket Sled. The intention of Mr. Coyote was to use the Rocket Sled to aid him in pursuit of his prey. Upon receipt of the Rocket Sled Mr. Coyote removed it from its wooden shipping crate and, sighting his prey in the distance, activated the ignition.

                  <p>Hello! I was trying to explain to someone how git cherry-pick works the other
day, and I found myself getting confused.
What went wrong was: I thought that git cherry-pick was basically applying a
patch, but when I tried to actually do it that way, it didn’t work!
Let’s talk about what I thought cherry-pick did (applying a patch), why
that’s not quite true, and what it actually does instead (a “3-way merge”).
This post is extremely in the weeds and you definitely don’t need to understand
this stuff to use git effectively. But if you (like me) are curious about git’s
internals, let’s talk about it!
cherry-pick isn’t applying a patch
The way I previously understood git cherry-pick COMMIT_ID is:
calculate the diff for COMMIT_ID, like git show COMMIT_ID --patch &gt; out.patch
Apply the patch to t…</p>

                  <p>Nearly everything about Fortnite’s popular Battle Royale mode is geared towards creating conflict between its players. In this episode of Pop Culture Detective, Jonathan McIntosh explores whether you can be a pacifist in a virtual world filled with war and, beyond that, whether you can make friends with your fiercest enemy. As a Fortnite player who has qualms about even the cartoony violence in the game, I loved this video. It reminded me of Robin Sloan’s piece in the Atlantic from 2018: I Played Fortnite and Figured Out the Universe.
When they’re successful, these negotiations are honestly more nervy and exciting than the game’s most intense shoot-outs. I’m not the only one who thinks so. In forums dedicated to Fortnite Battle Royale, some players share clips of chance alliances, and others reply glumly: “Super rare to find someone [who] won’t shoot you when you emote.” I dream of a Political Fortnite in which victory goes not to the twitchiest sniper but the most charismatic organizer, with factions forming and dissolving… I imagine the fear and thrill of seeing not one but a dozen tiny silhouettes on the far ridge-a war band sweeping fast down the hillside. I’m outnumbered; can I convince them to let me join them?


(thx, andy)

Sitting at my desk is always right. I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about how to make good work. There are millions of tips and tricks and manifestos out there. But at the end there’s only one single truth for me: sit down and start drawing.

                  <p>A quick and breezy introduction to some basic wayfinding techniques from Fran Scott and BBC Earth Kids. Unless you went to camp as a kid or have spent a bunch of time outdoors, at least some of these techniques will be new to you. I’d never heard of trees growing in a check mark shape. From natural navigation expert Tristan Gooley:
Obviously, all green plants need sunlight. So it’s logical that plants will, all things being equal, tend to grow more abundantly on the side the light comes from. In the northern parts of the world, where the sun is due south in the middle of the day, that means plants are growing more abundantly on the south side.
Try noticing this in a tree the next time you take a walk outside. You should see that there’s more tree on the south side, unless there are other factors-for instance there are amazing examples of glass buildings that can make trees grow the wrong way. But generally speaking, there should be more of the tree on the south side.


Gooley is the author of The Lost Art of Reading Nature’s Signs: Use Outdoor Clues to Find Your Way, Predict the Weather, Locate Water, Track Animals — and Other Forgotten Skills and several related books. (via the kid should see this)

                  <p>Using a custom hydrogen alpha solar telescope, Jason Kurth took a collection of high-resolution photographs of the recent annular solar eclipse and arranged them into an 8K video of the event. The level of detail here is incredible — you can see solar flares and features on the surface of the Sun pulsing and shifting as the Moon moves across it. You can see a bit of Kurth’s setup on Instagram.

                  <p>A few decades ago, Chérie Carter-Scott devised a list of 10 Rules for Being Human, which was published in her 1998 book If Life Is a Game, These Are the Rules. These rules are often presented on social media as being “handed down from ancient Sanskrit” but their more recent origin shouldn’t keep us from learning what we can from them. Here they are:
You will receive a body. You may love it or hate it, but it will be yours for the duration of your life on Earth.
You will be presented with lessons. You are enrolled in a full-time informal school called ‘life.’ Each day in this school you will have the opportunity to learn lessons. You may like the lessons or hate them, but you have designed them as part of your curriculum.



There are no mistakes, only lessons. Growth is a process of experimentation, a series of trials, errors, and occasional victories. The failed experiments are as much a part of the process as the experiments that work.



A lesson is repeated until learned. Lessons will be repeated to you in various forms until you have learned them. When you have learned them, you can then go on to the next lesson.



Learning does not end. There is no part of life that does not contain lessons. If you are alive, there are lessons to be learned.



“There” is no better than “here”. When your “there” has become a “here”, you will simply obtain a “there” that will look better to you than your present “here”.



Others are only mirrors of you. You cannot love or hate something about another person unless it reflects something you love or hate about yourself.



What you make of your life is up to you. You have all the tools and resources you need. What you do with them is up to you.



Your answers lie inside of you. All you need to do is look, listen, and trust.



You will forget all of this at birth. You can remember it if you want by unraveling the double helix of inner knowing.

Update: Chris Glass had a lovely experience with Carter-Scott’s book recently.

If you want a default layout for all pages there&#x27;s a few ways you can do this (which is why I found it hard to determine from the docs), but since I almost always have an .eleventy.js configuration file, putting it there is (what I think) the cleanest solution:
// assumes that &#x60;base.njk&#x60; lives inside _includes/
eleventyConfig.addGlobalData(&#x27;layout&#x27;, &#x27;base.njk&#x27;);</p>

                  <p>Large language models like GPT-4 are becoming increasingly capable, at an alarming rate. Within a couple of years, we won&#x27;t need developers any more! …Or at least, that&#x27;s the narrative going viral on Twitter. I&#x27;m much more optimistic about what these AI advancements mean for the future of software development.</p>

                  <p>The Nature Conservancy has announced this year’s winners of their annual photo contest. Collectively, the winning photographs “gave voice to nature and showed us the power and peril of the natural world”. As usual, I selected a few of my favorites and included them above. From top to bottom:
Jaime Daniel Fajardo Torres: “This is a species of spider known as ogre spiders, of the genus Deinopis. The photograph was taken at night in the middle of a mature forest in northern Ecuador in the tropical rainforest of the Ecuadorian Chocó, a place considered a hotspot. The spider photographed was generating its egg sac with its own web.”
HJ Yang: An orca attacks two seals in the morning on the beach.



Jeanny Tang: “The holes dug by fish for spawning can be seen after the pond has dried up.”

                  <p>The four members of the Beatles, assisted by machine learning technology, come together one last time to record a song together, working off of a demo tape recorded by John Lennon in the 70s.
The long mythologised John Lennon demo was first worked on in February 1995 by Paul, George and Ringo as part of The Beatles Anthology project but it remained unfinished, partly because of the impossible technological challenges involved in working with the vocal John had recorded on tape in the 1970s. For years it looked like the song could never be completed.
But in 2022 there was a stroke of serendipity. A software system developed by Peter Jackson and his team, used throughout the production of the documentary series Get Back, finally opened the way for the uncoupling of John’s vocal from his piano part. As a result, the original recording could be brought to life and worked on anew with contributions from all four Beatles.


Here’s the result, a song called Now and Then:

I enjoyed Ben Lindbergh’s take on the new song and its recording.

The idea that a company can do anything to create or perpetuate a monopoly so long as its prices go down and/or its quality goes up is directly to blame for the rise of Big Tech.

                  <p>Hello! While talking with folks about Git, I’ve been seeing a comment over and
over to the effect of “I hate rebase”. People seemed to feel pretty strongly
about this, and I was really surprised because I don’t run into a lot of
problems with rebase and I use it all the time.
I’ve found that if many people have a very strong opinion that’s different from
mine, usually it’s because they have different experiences around that thing
from me.
So I asked on Mastodon:
today I’m thinking about the tradeoffs of using git rebase a bit. I think
the goal of rebase is to have a nice linear commit history, which is something
I like.
but what are the costs of using rebase? what problems has it caused for you
in practice? I’m really only interested in specific bad experiences you’ve had
here – not opinio…</p>

How close are we to the Speakularity today? Or is it still in the distance?

                  <p>In 2011, Robin Sloan wrote “Blessed Are the Toolmakers.” It’s a (light) rejection of the urge to make general-purpose software and platforms in favor of something smaller yet more productive.
“I wish more people were making tools for a specific creative purpose rather than for general consumer adoption. I wish more people were making tools that very intentionally do not scale—tools with users by the dozen. Tools you experience not through a web signup form, but through pathbreaking creative work.
“I guess I want fewer aspirational Apples and more Pixar wannabes.”</p>

                  <p>Tomorrow, November 4th, 2023, is my first wedding anniversary. I married Karen McGrane at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia in 2022. We walked down the aisle to Gonzo’s “I’m Going To Back There Someday.” It was one of the best days of my life.
To celebrate our anniversary, I’m reposting what I wrote shortly after I moved into Karen’s house (which also, somewhat unusually, was the first time we met in person). It’s also the most recent — and since we haven’t renewed our WordPress license, quite possibly the last — post on Snarkmarket.com. I hope Kottke.org readers enjoy it.
Why write a blog post somewhere nobody has published in five years, in a new WordPress interface where you recognize… yeah, nothing? Where somehow you can’t even upload a JPG or PNG file you downloaded from another …</p>

                  <p>Somehow Snarkmarket contains no links to one of my favorite essays of all time, “As We May Think,” by Vannevar Bush. Our esteemed host has linked to it, of course, because Kottke.org is an unparalleled collection of fine hypertext products. But I think it’s worth a repeat. Many people know this essay, but most still don’t.
Bush was part of the Oppenheimer set; he was an engineer whose work was critical to the creation of the atomic bomb. By the time this essay was published, Mussolini and Hitler were dead, and World War II was almost over. He begins from a perspective I find cold and alienating, that of a scientist exhilarated by an intellectual pursuit that has left millions dead and more devastated. He doesn’t reckon with this even as he writes a paean to what science has accomplished:

                  <p>Earlier this week, Dave Winer (the inventor of RSS and lots of other notable software, and one of the earliest bloggers) made a podcast for me. He posted it publicly, so it wasn’t sealed like a letter, but it was addressed to me and responding to something I wrote on Threads. I don’t think I’ve ever been the personal addressee of a podcast before: like an @-reply, but in audio.
For some reason, it reminded me of the poet Frank O’Hara’s “Personism” manifesto:
[Personism] was founded by me after lunch with LeRoi Jones on August 27, 1959, a day in which I was in love with someone (not Roi, by the way, a blond). I went back to work and wrote a poem for this person. While I was writing it I was realizing that if I wanted to I could use the telephone instead of writing the poem, and so Personism…</p>

                  <p>By the end of 2015, Snarkmarket had slowed way, way down. But its writers would still pop by from time to time to revisit the site and write something for its community. (“A hardy desert ecosystem,” Robin once called it.) This post, “Unforgotten,” by Matt Thompson reflects on blogging a decade after its peak.
“Blogs like this one are speakeasies now, not raucous pubs. I don’t actually know if fewer people are ‘reading blogs’ or if it’s that the web has grown so much larger that the boutique communities of yesteryear merely feel less significant. But I will say, I find enduring and immense value in this place, in the fact that you’re here, reading these words, however you’ve found them. Speakeasies can be marvelous spots.”</p>

But first, we did a year-long online seminar to prepare how we wanted to rethink the site.</p>

                  <p>Robin Sloan on stock and flow in media:
Flow is the feed. It’s the posts and the tweets. It’s the stream of daily and sub-daily updates that reminds people you exist.

Stock is the durable stuff. It’s the content you produce that’s as interesting in two months (or two years) as it is today. It’s what people discover via search. It’s what spreads slowly but surely, building fans over time.</p>

                  <p>Once, Kottke.org’s tagline was “Liberal Arts 2.0.” It’s a terrific description of everything the blog covers and how Jason covers it; unpacking the web with a humanist lens, looking for noteworthy specimens and bigger connections. 
It also chimed with “Web 2.0,” which was a popular descriptive and prescriptive phrase at the time. Tim Berners-Lee famously derided “Web 2.0” as “jargon,” claiming that the web was always intended to be a social and collaborative medium and that the things the proponents of a web renewal wanted to emphasize were there from the start. Which is… basically accurate!
But the liberal arts badly needed (and still badly need) an update for the age of the web. So many of the big Web 2.0 projects (social networking and commerce, folksonomies, the web as a development pl…</p>

                  <p>Today, November 3rd, is my 44th birthday. Tomorrow, the 4th, is my first wedding anniversary. But today is also an important day in my personal history of the web, and I’d argue, in the history of blogging, or at least our corner of it. It’s the twentieth anniversary of Snarkmarket, founded by Robin Sloan and Matt Thompson. It’s also the fifteenth anniversary of the day I joined as the site’s third blogger, or Snarkmaster, after five years of being part of the site’s community (the Snarkmatrix). (Coincidentally, Obama was first elected President that November 4th. It was a really good couple of days.)
If you didn’t have the good fortune to read Snarkmarket while it was active, I’ll give you a quick précis. Robin and Matt both graduated college in 2002, then completed a year of journalism s…</p>

                  <p>It’s a pleasure to be here in Jason’s esteemed garden of links and digressions, celebrating 20 years since we created Snarkmarket. In keeping with our host’s splendid curatorial style, most of what I’ll post here are not little bloggy essays like this one. But there’s one thing I especially wanted to ask this crowd about.
Few people would ever have known about Snarkmarket if not for the short video Robin and I made, EPIC 2014 (and then, a year later, 2015), that went viral in an era of the internet in which virality was difficult. To make a video viral in 2004 meant people mirroring a file on their private servers, linking to it on their blogs, and emailing links to friends and colleagues. But the video itself imagined that friction as a thing of the past. YouTube didn’t yet exist, but we’…</p>

                  <p>In the past few decades, we’ve found out a great deal about pre-Columbian civilizations &amp; inhabitants of the Americas, including those in the Amazon rainforest, where settlements were larger and more numerous than previously believed.
When European colonizers arrived in the 16th century, they were captivated by rumors of a golden city, hidden somewhere in the rainforest. Their search for “El Dorado” lasted more than a century, but only resulted in disaster, death, and further conquest of the indigenous people there.
Experts thereafter looked at the Amazon and saw only a desolate jungle; too harsh for extensive agriculture and therefore sparsely populated. They believed that it had always been this way.
Until recently.
Beginning in the late 20th century, archaeologists began looking more closely at the forest floor. Working with the indigenous people who still remained there, they excavated long ditches and mounds. After mapping them, they could see that these were the markings of large settlements; walls, moats, plazas, and roads that connected even more settlements. And they were all over the Amazon.

Medieval dachshund - Or: drawing with words
Here are three examples of a technique called “micrography”: decorative scenes that are drawn with words written in a tiny script. While there are examples from Latin books made in the West (here is one), the technique is particularly common in medieval Hebrew manuscripts. The drawings are usually found in biblical manuscripts and they appear to be commentaries to the text. The technique, whereby a scribe wrote in the smallest handwriting possible, goes back to the 9th century AD. The examples here, from the 13th century, shows just how entertaining the word-made drawings can be: they are an opportunity for the scribe to frolick in the margins of the page - like drawing a creature that looks like a dachshund.

                  <p>Hello everyone, I’ve got a bit of a treat for you. Tomorrow (Nov 3) marks the 20th anniversary of Snarkmarket, a quietly influential group blog that featured the writing of Tim Carmody, Matt Thompson, Robin Sloan, and a few other contributors. There hasn’t been much activity over there for several years, but it was a must-read for me back in the day (with a lively comments section) — you may remember the EPIC video that Robin and Matt made (oh, seeing that old design brings back memories!) or Robin’s evergreen classic on stock &amp; flow.
Anyway, tomorrow Matt, Robin, and Tim are taking over kottke.org to celebrate their anniversary, reminisce about the Good Old Days, and perhaps opine a bit about how people relating to each other online has changed in the 20 years since the formation of the Snarkmatrix. Comments will be on and they’ll be in there mixing it up with you.
So then: I hereby declare November 3, 2023 Snarkmarket Day on kottke.org. Bake it away, toys!

                  <p>Using survey data, responses from community boards &amp; city council members, and over 37,000 responses from NYC residents, a team at the NY Times has made a detailed map of the 350+ distinct neighborhoods in NYC. From a companion article:
It’s a New York pastime to gripe that neighborhoods are invented and defined by real estate brokers, developers and other city gatekeepers. But the more interesting truth may be that they are also reinvented and reinforced, refracted through race and class, by us: by the air traffic controller who lives in Little Yemen, by the Manhattan community manager who’s sure his constituents live in East Harlem — and not “Upper Carnegie Hill” — and by the Brooklyn residents who decided to name a relatively flat piece of land Boerum Hill.
A name has power. It can foreshadow who will be moving in. By itself, it can conjure so much: gentrification, displacement, inequality, status. When we argue over names, or even invent new ones, we may be trying to exert some of that power — or lamenting that others have more power than we do.
We asked New Yorkers themselves to map their neighborhoods and to tell us what they call them. The result, while imperfect, is probably the most detailed map of the city’s neighborhoods ever compiled.


The article is interesting throughout:
Our map reveals two main kinds of divisions: sharp ones and fuzzy ones.
The fuzzy ones often reflect areas in transition or dispute, where there’s no consensus or where gentrification is rewriting boundaries in real time.
The sharp ones often reflect features of the landscape itself: wide avenues, highways, remnants of canals. When you cross the street, you know you’re in another neighborhood.


Next time I’m in NYC, I’m definitely going to Little Yemen for lunch.

                  <p>Usability and aesthetics usually go hand in hand.
In fact, there is even what we call the “Aesthetic Usability Effect”:
users perceive beautiful interfaces as easier to use and cut them more slack when it comes to minor usabiity issues.
Unfortunately, sometimes usability and aesthetics can be at odds, also known as “form over function”.
Simplicity, and knowing when to stop
A common incarnation of form-over-function, is when designers start identifying signifiers and affordances as noise to be eliminated,
sacrificing a great deal of learnability for an — often marginal — improvement in aesthetics.
Aesthetic and Minimalist Design is one of the Nielsen/Norman core usability heuristics (and all other heuristics taxonomies have something similar).

                  <p>I know I always say this, but I didn’t mean for so much time to elapse since the last installment of the media diet. But I have a slightly different reason for the delay this time: I have been really busy with work and family stuff, so much so that I haven’t been reading or watching as much as I usually do. So I needed to wait a couple of months to collect enough stuff.
Anyway. Here’s my recent media diet, a roundup of what I’ve been reading, watching, listening to, and experiencing over the past few months. ✌️

                  <p>If you look closely at a rainbow made from sunlight (e.g. through a prism or an actual rainbow), you’ll notice that some of the colors are missing. It turns out that these absent colors (called Fraunhofer lines) have something to do with the types of elements that are present in the Sun (and the Earth’s atmosphere). Dr. Joe Hanson explains in the video above.
Over 200 years ago, scientists were looking at sunlight through a prism when they noticed that part of the rainbow was missing. There were dark lines where there should have been colors. Since then, scientists have unlocked the secrets encoded in these lines, using it to uncover mind-boggling facts about the fundamental nature of our universe and about worlds light-years away.


Science is fascinating…Fraunhofer lines can tell us something about objects and processes all along the Powers of Ten scale, from the inner workings of the atom to the composition of the Earth’s atmosphere to how quickly the universe is expanding or contracting.
If you’d like to check out the missing parts of the rainbow for yourself, you can make this DIY spectroscope using a CD or DVD and a few other items. (via the kid should see this)

                  <p>Hello! I’m slowly working on explaining git. One of my biggest problems is that
after almost 15 years of using git, I’ve become very used to git’s
idiosyncracies and it’s easy for me to forget what’s confusing about it.
So I asked people on Mastodon:
what git jargon do you find confusing? thinking of writing a blog post that explains some of git’s weirder terminology: “detached HEAD state”, “fast-forward”, “index/staging area/staged”, “ahead of ‘origin/main’ by 1 commit”, etc
I got a lot of GREAT answers and I’ll try to summarize some of them here.  Here’s a list of the terms:
HEAD and “heads”
“detached HEAD state”
“ours” and “theirs” while merging or rebasing
“Your branch is up to date with ‘origin/main’”
HEAD^, HEAD~ HEAD^^, HEAD~~, HEAD^2, HEAD~2
.. and …
“can be fast-forwarded”
“refere…</p>

                  <p>YouTube channel Polyphonic (whose videos I’ve featured before) has taken on an ambitious project: tracing the history of the electric guitar solo from its origins in blues and country music in the American South all the way up to the present day. The series is called Axe To Grind and the first three episodes are available on YouTube (the first two are embedded above). People are sharing their favorite early electric guitar players in the comments of the first video.
The series is also available on the subscription-only Nebula — episodes appear there first and the music excerpts are longer because Nebula doesn’t trample all over creators’ fair use rights like YT does. (via open culture)

                  <p>Look, I’m tired of all things Trump too, but for some reason, but this improv of Lord of the Rings’ Sauron as Trump by Brennan Mulligan had me rolling on the floor. The cadence is perfect.</p>

                  <p>Fungi: Web of Life is an upcoming IMAX documentary on mushrooms &amp; their fungi brethren narrated by Björk and presented by Merlin Sheldrake.
Join acclaimed British biologist, Dr. Merlin Sheldrake, on a quest to find an incredibly precious blue mushroom, against the backdrop of Tasmania’s ancient Tarkine rainforest. Merlin will show us some the grandest and strangest organisms ever discovered, showcased through jaw-dropping time-lapse cinematography, in a landscape largely unchanged from the time of the dinosaurs. Fungi have important lessons to teach humanity about survival through cooperation. Indeed, these incredible lifeforms may hold the key to solving some of humanity’s most urgent problems. With millions more species to discover, our journey into the secret world of fungi has only just begun.


Sheldrake is the author of Entangled Life: How Fungi Make Our Worlds, Change Our Minds &amp; Shape Our Futures.

                  <p>Based on the bestselling book Stamped from the Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America by Ibram X. Kendi (also available as a graphic novel), this documentary explores the mythology of American racism and how it still shapes the world today. The director is Oscar-winner Roger Ross Williams and in preparing for the film, he decided that only Black women would appear in it:
“When we started looking at historians and scholars, we came up with a long list. I noticed the pattern that most of the people doing the work around racism in America were Black women,” Williams told Netflix. “I asked them in pre-interviews, ‘Why do you do this work?’ And many of them said the same thing — that they had no choice. This was their experience and their life. And if they’re going to dedicate their life to something, it’s going to be about changing and understanding racism in America because they can’t escape racism in America. I said to everyone, ‘We’re going to have only Black women in this film.’ It was an important statement to make.


Stamped From the Beginning comes out on Netflix on November 20.

                  <p>Lego master Jumpei Mitsui spent over 400 hours building a 3D version of Hokusai’s Great Wave off Kanagawa out of 50,000 Lego bricks — you can watch a time lapse of the construction in the video above. The build was included at an exhibition of Hokusai’s work at the MFA in Boston:
In order to create Hokusai’s Wave in three dimensions, he made a detailed study of rogue waves and their characteristics. He also drew on childhood memories of waves near his family home at Akashi on the Inland Sea.


The video slows down to realtime in spots, so you can see how fast he’s actually building (quite fast). And you can also see the level of trial and error involved as he builds and then un-builds the waves until he’s happy with them. (via the kid should see this)

Also good from the same episode: a soul food cooking competition:

As Tressie McMillan Cottom says: “Every time he says ‘I’m sorry’, it gets funnier.”

                  <p>There are only a couple of things I like about Halloween: 1. Heidi Klum’s costumes (last year she dressed up as a worm), and 2. the relatively recent Japanese tradition of mundane Halloween costumes. From Spoon &amp; Tamago and Nick Kapur (here too), here are a few of my favorite mundane costumes:

“Factory worker who wore a helmet all day”

“Person who was about to be late for work, but then their train got delayed and now they are taking their time since they got a proof-of-delay ticket from the station”

“Person taking a hearing test at the doctor’s office”
See also 2021’s best costumes, including “guy who leans in as his Mario Kart character turns a curve”.

                  <p>My friend&#x27;s son had a kid&#x27;s kindle that wasn&#x27;t charging any more. They were going to buy a replacement, but then asked me whether I thought it was fixable. Definitely!
I&#x27;d not fixed a Kindle before, but my guess was the USB port was probably at fault. Inspecting it under the microscope (and looking at the mouth of the port) I could see it was definitely the problem. It&#x27;s understandable that a young child isn&#x27;t always going to connect the USB cable cleanly and the port had eventually given up the ghost.
Opening the Kindle Fire is the process of unclipping the edge - there&#x27;s no screws on the outside. Once open, the main board can be lifted off, on the reverse side (to my photos) is a ribbon cable that can&#x27;t be disconnected right next to the USB port.
Using a hot air gun and lots of constant movement, I was able to free the USB port without melting the ribbon cable or the FPC connector (which is entirely plastic). By keeping the airflow moving it protects plastics from heating up but allows the solder to melt, but it takes practise and a careful hand.
Once free, I had a replacement from eBay and once re-installed the Kindle Fire charged up just like old times.
One more bit of tech saved from landfill 💪</p>

                  <p>Just hit play on this one and watch it. Absolutely magical…it sent shivers down my spine. The organization that arranged this is called Choir! Choir! Choir! and they also did a version of this in Dublin with 1000 people singing in tribute:

I’ve previously featured the group singing David Bowie’s Heroes with David Byrne, who said this of the experience:
What happens when one sings together with a lot of other people?
A couple of things I immediately noticed. There is a transcendent feeling in being subsumed and surrendering to a group. This applies to sports, military drills, dancing… and group singing. One becomes a part of something larger than oneself, and something in our makeup rewards us when that happens. We cling to our individuality, but we experience true ecstasy when we give it up.

                  <p>I enjoyed reading Ted Gioia’s list of 12 problems that he’s devoted his life to answering. Many of them go to the heart of how to lead a life of creativity and compassion, things which are often at odds in our culture.

It’s a scale for measuring how people visualize objects in their heads. I’m between 4 &amp; 5, which means I have a condition called aphantasia. Marco Giancotti recently wrote about this for Nautilus; he underwent an MRI scan to test what was going on in his head:
A few seconds pass, then a synthetic female voice speaks into my ears over the electronic clamor: “top hat.” I close my eyes and I imagine a top hat. A few seconds later a beep tells me I should rate the quality of my mental picture, which I do with a controller in my hand. The voice speaks again: “fire extinguisher,” and I repeat the routine. Next is “butterfly,” then “camel,” then “snowmobile,” and so on, for about 10 minutes, while the system monitors the activation of m…</p>

While these are outrageous and horrifying events, they aren’t surprising or shocking in any way in a country where more than 33,000 people die from gun violence each year.
America is a stuck in a Groundhog Day loop of gun violence. We’ll keep waking up, stuck in the same reality of oppression, carnage, and ruined lives until we can figure out how to effect meaningful change.

The home was a living world where you could discover books that were like doorways into poetic realms. The animation style was like Disney’s Fantasia meets late 90’s goth.

                  <p>Lego is coming out with a huge new set that’s based on Denis Villeneuve’s two-installment adaptation of Dune (or, as it’s know around these parts, DUNC). OMG, the Baron Harkonnen minifig!! It reminds me of something…ah yes:

Longbaron is looooooooong.
Anyway, it’s coming out in February and the main build is a 1369-piece model of the Atreides Royal Ornithopter with “fold-out, flappable wings, deployable landing gear and an opening cockpit”. Baron Harkooooooooooooonnen. I can’t stop! I, uh, may have pre-ordered this the second I saw it. (via polygon)
Update: Absolutely perfect:

                  </ul>
                  <p>From 1913 to 1944, amateur mycologist Hans Walty created hundreds of fantastic watercolor illustrations of mushrooms, which are available to peruse in very high-resolution at Wikimedia Commons. There’s not a great deal of information about Walty or his drawings online,1 but I did find this piece from the Swiss National Library. 
His images depict the colours and shapes of the mushrooms’ fruiting bodies and sometimes also include drawings of microscopic views. The fungi are usually depicted from the side and often from the top and bottom as well. Walty also frequently documented the characteristics of the stems, spores and undersides of the caps. The hobby mycologist also produced an explanatory book to accompany his illustrations that contains descriptions of the mushrooms, with each specimen being assigned a family and genus. His illustrations often contain notes about the time and date the mushroom was found and whether it was edible, inedible or poisonous.


Walty’s illustrations were published in multiple editions of a Swiss mushroom guide from the 40s through the 70s. According to the German version of Wikipedia (translated): “For decades, 500 of his illustrations on mushrooms were considered a standard work on mushroom identification, especially in Switzerland.”
Again, you can browse through hundreds of Walty’s mushroom illustrations at Wikimedia Commons. (thx, christoph)

Not in English at least; Walty was born in Italy and lived in Germany and Switzerland for much of his life. A biography is available on the German version of Wikipedia. ↩

                  <p>Papercraft artist Charles Young has been sourcing color combinations from this book and using them to construct extremely tidy and precise little buildings.
Starting in May 2020 I used Sanzo Wada&#x27;s Dictionary of Colour Combinations as inspiration for a new project introducing colour to my paper work for the first time. The book is made up of two, three and four colour combinations drawn from Japanese design and publishing in the early 20th century.


Check this out to get a sense of the scale — they&#x27;re really tiny. You can see many more of these on Instagram. It is actually hard to believe these are made out of paper and not computer generated. (via present &amp; correct)

                  <p>This story is a few years old but it charmed me too much this morning to let it slide. In 2017, four years after its grand reopening, Amsterdam&#x27;s Rijksmuseum welcomed its 10-millionth visitor, a man named Stefan Kasper. His lucky timing resulted in getting to spend the night in the museum, where he dined and slept underneath Rembrandt&#x27;s the Night Watch.

Here&#x27;s a short video of Kasper&#x27;s time in the museum:

I still can&#x27;t believe it. I discovered characters that I have never seen before. They came to life in front of me. It&#x27;s an experience that is forever etched in my memory.


Not the same, but I got to go to a press preview when the MoMA reopened a few years ago after renovations and it was quite an experience to wander those familiar galleries pretty much by myself. I stood in front of Starry Night and One: Number 31, 1950 for a really long time that morning.

                  </ul>
                  <p>In a piece about how English and North American robins (two unrelated species that don&#x27;t even share a biological genus or family) got their names, Robert Francis shares how some English birds were given people names...and some of them stuck.
During the 15th century, the English had an endearing practice of granting common human names to the birds that lived among them. Virtually every bird in that era had a name, and most of them, like Will Wagtail and Philip Sparrow have been long forgotten. Polly Parrot has stuck around, and Tom Tit and Jenny Wren, personable companions of the English countryside, are names still sometimes found in children&#x27;s rhymes. Other human names, however, have been incorporated so durably into the common names that still grace birds as to almost entirely obscure their origin. The Magpie, a loquacious black and white bird with a penchant for snatching shiny objects, once bore the simple name &quot;pie,&quot; probably coming from its Roman name, &quot;pica.&quot; The English named these birds Margaret, which was then abbreviated to Maggie, and finally left at Mag Pie.[2] The vocal, crow-like bird called Jackdaw was also once just a &quot;daw&quot; named &quot;Jack.&quot; 
The English also gave their ubiquitous and beloved orange-bellied, orb-shaped, wren-sized bird a human name. The first recorded Anglo-Saxon name for the Eurasian Robin was ruddoc, meaning &quot;little red one.&quot; By the medieval period, its name evolved to redbreast (the more accurate term orange only entered the English language when the fruit of the same name reached Great Britain in the 16th century). The English chose the satisfyingly alliterative name Robert for the redbreast, which they then changed to the popular Tudor nickname Robin. Soon enough, the name Robin Redbreast became so identified with the bird that Redbreast was dropped because it seemed so redundant.


I found this list of other people names for birds as well — other examples include jays and martins. (via @gretchenmcc)

When Groff starts something new, she writes it out longhand in large spiral notebooks. After she completes a first draft, she puts it in a bankers box — and never reads it again. Then she&#x27;ll start the book over, still in longhand, working from memory. The idea is that this way, only the best, most vital bits survive.
&quot;It&#x27;s not even the words on the page that accumulate, because I never look at them again, really, but the ideas and the characters start to take on gravity and density,&quot; she said.
&quot;Nothing matters except for these lightning bolts that I&#x27;ve discovered,&quot; she continued, &quot;the images that are happening, the sounds that are happening, that feel alive. Those are the only things that really matter from draft to draft.&quot;


And also this:
In the afternoon, Groff deals with the business of being an author, responding to emails, doing publicity, writing blurbs. And she reads. A lot. In just the past few days, she said, she finished &quot;Living and Dying With Marcel Proust,&quot; completed a reread of &quot;Moby Dick,&quot; and started a graphic novel called &quot;Roaming.&quot; She estimates she reads about 300 books a year.
Groff will drop quotes into casual conversation, citing, say, Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s take on form and function, but she manages to do this in an entirely unaffected way, just tossing out an interesting nugget for consideration. Her editor, McGrath, said that Groff reread all of Shakespeare so she could write a version of &quot;The Vaster Wilds&quot; in iambic pentameter &quot;just for fun,&quot; as a way for her to master Elizabethan rhythms.


All of Shakespeare, just for fun. Yep.

Or at least, trying to read. I&#x27;ve been super busy with work and at the end of the day, the last thing I want to do is read more. But I will get back to it!↩

                  <p>I loved playing around with the National Audubon Society&#x27;s Bird Migration Explorer, which is a beautifully designed interactive map of the Western hemisphere that shows the seasonal migration patterns of more than 450 species of birds. What a resource...so much information to explore here. (via marco c. in the comments)

                  <p>One of the things I was thinking about doing with the comments is having posts on Fridays that are specifically participatory. So let&#x27;s try it out today. Currently, there&#x27;s no profile information available for commenters...you can&#x27;t click on a name to visit their Instagram acct or whatever. That feature is on my to-do list but it might be awhile before I get to it. But I know folks are curious about who reads the site...
So, in the meantime, if you feel comfortable sharing, you can use this thread to introduce yourself: maybe where you live, what you&#x27;re into, your social accounts. I think many of us smartly err on the side of not sharing too many specific details about ourselves online (myself included, but it&#x27;s obviously complicated 🙃) due to safety issues, but I think it&#x27;s possible to get to know each other a little bit without spilling too many beans. (thx to Russell for the idea)

                  <p>Hey everyone. I rolled out a new comments system (in beta!) on Monday and it seems to have been well-received so far. I&#x27;ve fixed some of the most egregious bugs and rolled out some tweaks and it seems to be holding up pretty well. 🤞 (Is there a knock-on-wood emoji?)
It&#x27;s early days and I&#x27;m rolling things out slowly (only ~10 posts were open for comments this week out of about 50), but commenting activity waned as the week went on. Discovery is still poor (there&#x27;s no list of open comment threads) and there aren&#x27;t any notifications — even as an admin user, I have to go to the front page of the site and click into individual threads to see if there&#x27;s anything new. That&#x27;s an obvious hinderance to participation and I&#x27;m gonna make a first pass at fixing it next week.
I also recognize that it&#x27;s …</p>

                  <p>I’ve been very slowly working on writing about how Git works. I thought I
already knew Git pretty well, but as usual when I try to explain something I’ve
been learning some new things.
None of these things feel super surprising in retrospect, but I hadn’t thought
about them clearly before.
The facts are:
the “index”, “staging area” and “–cached” are all the same thing
the stash is a bunch of commits
not all references are branches or tags
merge commits aren’t empty
Let’s talk about them!
the “index”, “staging area” and “–cached” are all the same thing
When you run git add file.txt, and then git status, you’ll see something like this:
$ git add content/post/2023-10-20-some-miscellaneous-git-facts.markdown
$ git status

                  <p>The influential Whole Earth Catalog, along with a number of related publications, has been uploaded to The Internet Archive and is now available online for free at the Whole Earth Index. From Wired:
The Whole Earth Catalog was the proto-blog — a collection of reviews, how-to guides, and primers on anarchic libertarianism printed onto densely packed pages. It carried the tagline &quot;Access to Tools&quot; and offered know-how, product reviews, cultural analysis, and gobs of snark, long before you could get all that on the internet.
At the time of its initial publication in the late 1960s, the periodical became a beacon for techno-optimists and back-to-the-land hippies. The Whole Earth Catalog preached self-reliance, teaching young baby boomers how to build their own cabins, garden sheds, and geodesic domes after they had turned on, tuned in, and dropped out — well before they grew wealthy enough to buy up all the three-bedroom single-family homes. The catalog also had a profound impact on Silicon Valley&#x27;s ethos, and is credited with seeding the ideas that helped fuel today&#x27;s startup culture.

                  <p>Even if you haven&#x27;t seen Stop Making Sense, you are likely familiar with the herky jerky dance moves of Talking Heads&#x27; frontman David Byrne. In this video, which has only recently been made public, you can see Byrne practicing his now-iconic moves.
40 years ago, David Byrne rehearsed dances for Talking Heads&#x27; upcoming Speaking in Tongues tour by recording video of himself to determine which moves worked better than others, which developed into many of the iconic moves seen in the Stop Making Sense movie, filmed at the end of 1983 and released in 1984. It was recently rereleased by A24 in restored 4K. These videos, recorded in David Byrne&#x27;s loft, have been mentioned before in interviews and now after 40 years the footage is finally available!


If you don&#x27;t want to sit through the full 25-minute video, here&#x27;s an hors d&#x27;oeuvres version:

                  <p>For the New Yorker, Daniel Immerwahr reviews a new book, Steven Conn&#x27;s The Lies of the Land: Seeing Rural America for What It Is — and Isn&#x27;t (Bookshop.org), which makes the case that what we typically think of as rural America or &quot;real America&quot; is a mirage.
A piercing, unsentimental new book, &quot;The Lies of the Land&quot; (Chicago), by the historian Steven Conn, takes the long view. Wistful talk of &quot;real America&quot; aside, Conn, who teaches at Miami University, in Oxford, Ohio, argues that the rural United States is, in fact, highly artificial. Its inhabitants are as much creatures of state power and industrial capitalism as their city-dwelling counterparts. But we rarely acknowledge this, Conn writes, because many of us — urban and rural, on the left and the right — &quot;don&#x27;t quite want it to be true.…</p>

Therefore, we will award government-backed monopolies – patents – to pharma companies so they will have an incentive to invest their shareholders&#x27; capital in research.

                  <p>One of the best uses of technology is to make people laugh. In this three-part series, the Numerical YouTube channels uses some simple editing to increase the size of the goal until some laughably off-the-mark strikes by professional footballers Ousmane Dembélé, Harry Kane (his penalty miss vs France), and Nicolas Jackson finally find their targets. The misses just get more and more funny as the goal gets bigger.

                  <p>One of my recent favorite YouTube channels is James Payne&#x27;s Great Art Explained, which does exactly what it says on the tin, showcasing works of art like Starry Night, the Great Wave, and A Sunday on La Grande Jatte. Payne recently launched a new channel in the same vein: Great Books Explained. Here&#x27;s a trailer, featuring a short clip of his exploration of Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland.

Being an avid reader, I always wanted to do a book channel as well, but did not have the time, so these films are collaborations with different writers who are passionate about certain books, and the first release will be James Joyce&#x27;s Ulysses (in this case co-created with Henry Mountford). This will be followed by Alice.


The video on James Joyce&#x27;s Ulysses is out now:

The optic nerves of a rodent by Hassanain Qambari &amp; Jayden Dickson.
A heart shape is visible amongst breast cancer cells shot by Malgorzata Lisowska.



Sunflower pollen on an acupuncture needle by John-Oliver Dum.

And I love a good slime mold photo too. (via ars technica)

                  <p>At their recent creativity conference, Adobe showed off Project Primrose, in the form of a dress that changes colors and patterns at the click of a button. The garment could also display animations, including ones that respond to the wearer&#x27;s movements. From The Kid Should See This:
Created with small scales or petals that are programmed with Adobe software, the futuristic &#x27;fabric&#x27; can be used for clothing, handbags, curtains, furniture, and endless other surfaces.
Research Scientist Christine Dierk and her team designed and programmed everything about it. Dierk also stitched it together.

                  <p>From illustrator Pablo Carlos Budassi, this is a circular map of the universe.
The solar system is located in the center. Towards the edges, the scale is progressively reduced to show in detail the most distant and biggest structures of the observable universe sphere.


There are several other representations of the universe on Budassi&#x27;s site, including links to prints, posters, and other products.

                  <p>This is a heck of a time capsule: back in 2011, Chris Floyd photographed 140 people that he followed on Twitter over the course of a year and made a video featuring their portraits and audio of them &quot;talking about Twitter and it&#x27;s effect on the way we communicate and form relationships in the modern era&quot;. It&#x27;s almost quaint hearing people talk about the site in the time before Gamergate, 4chan, and other factors helped twist it into a very different place.

You can check out more of Floyd&#x27;s photographs and people&#x27;s stories on the One Hundred &amp; Forty Characters blog. (via noah kalina)

                  <p>A.V. Club has taken on the task of ranking the best 50 music videos, from the first video ever played on MTV (Video Killed the Radio Star by The Buggles, featuring none other than soundtrack composer Hans Zimmer on keys) to Thriller, Sabotage, Addicted to Love, and Sledgehammer. You can watch the whole list via this playlist on YouTube.

I loved the video for Sledgehammer. I was 12 years old the summer it came out. We didn&#x27;t have cable TV then, but I&#x27;d turn on MTV anywhere I could, hoping for a glimpse of it. My dad used to take my sister and me on roadtrips all over the country and I vividly remember the rare times we got to stay in a motel (they had to have a swimming pool with a diving board), turning on MTV, and catching that Sledgehammer video a few times every hour. It was only years later, after becoming a Wallace and Gromit fan, that I learned that — of course! — Aardman had done the animation for Sledgehammer.

                  <p>This is great and I loved it to bits: a 15-minute video from the Life Where I&#x27;m From YouTube channel about a tiny izakaya (13 seats!) in Tokyo owned and operated by a woman called &quot;Mama&quot; by her regulars.
When Mama is busy, regulars at this izakaya will serve themselves, get their own beers, get their &quot;bottle-keep&quot; and make their own drinks. They&#x27;ll also help out Mama-san by serving other customers as well. [...] Bottle keep is when a customer buys a bottle and the shop holds on to it for them. Then the next time they visit they can drink from that bottle again.


I&#x27;ve got lots of thoughts about this and connections to make! The izakaya&#x27;s casual help-yourself atmosphere reminded me of a post I made here more than 20 years ago called Business Lessons From the Donut and Coffee Guy.

                  <p>Name Sans is a typeface based on the tile mosaic lettering found in NYC subway stations.
The architects and craftworkers who designed &amp; laid these tiles used a letter construction that was part geometric and part grotesque, with typographic optical corrections often either exaggerated or totally missing. Name Sans interprets these ideas into an extensive type system that is at once anonymous and full of personality, useful for everything from branding to wayfinding to digital interfaces.


Lovely. I like this a lot.

                  <p>For the past few months, I&#x27;ve been working on a new commenting system for kottke.org and today I&#x27;m launching it in beta. If you&#x27;re a kottke.org member, you can try it out by heading to the comment section of this very post. (More on this in a bit but: comments are public but only members can post them.) I wrote up some community guidelines; I&#x27;d appreciate you reading them before participating.
So why comments? And why now? Blog comments have been long since left for dead, a victim of spam, social media, toxicity, and neglect. But there are still plenty of sites out there with thriving communities. My particular favorite is Cup of Jo, which has some of the best comment threads on the web:

                  <p>I loved this letter in the recent Metropolitan Diary from the NY Times (gift link). It begins:
My friend Tom runs a popular whale watch cruise out of Sheepshead Bay. Recently, an avid whale watcher and good friend, Buddy, died. One of Buddy&#x27;s wishes was that Tom spread his ashes on the ocean he loved so much.
So, on a beautiful summer evening, Tom canceled his usual nightly cruise and organized a private memorial service. More than 80 of Buddy&#x27;s friends and family members came to say a last goodbye.
A serious-looking young woman who sat quietly by herself was among the passengers. None of the other people, including the crew members, knew who she was.


I won&#x27;t spoil the ending...you&#x27;ll have to click through to read.
I&#x27;ve never been to any memorial services at sea, but I did go whale watching in Alaska once. The extremely salty captain of the boat had two prosthetic hands with hooks on them (as Tom Nash demonstrates in this video). After we got underway, he left his first mate in charge and came out on the windy deck, got a cigarette and a matchbook out of his shirt pocket, tore off a match, and, with a single try, lit the cigarette. In, like, whipping 20 mph winds with the boat heaving in the waves. He was standing right in front of me when as he did it and it remains one of the most physically impressive things I have ever seen a person do. The man was so perfectly in his element that it was almost magical.</p>

There is an entire little universe of people using Patreon to be funded to do good works in the world. These may be open source contributors. They may be activists. They may be journalists or bloggers. They do not make things that they exchange for money with the people who pledge them on Patreon.
Their patrons do not pay these creators to give things to them. Their patrons pay these creators to give things to the world: to release code for anyone to use, to engage in activism that changes the world for the better, or to write things that anyone can read.
I&#x27;m one of them. The number one reason I signed up for Patreon as my funding platform nin…</p>

                  <p>This is a great overview and review by Teri Kanefield of Heather Cox Richardson&#x27;s new book, Democracy Awakening.
She opens with: &quot;America is at a crossroads.&quot; 
But crossroads aren&#x27;t new. We&#x27;ve been at them before.
She shows how this moment is part of an ongoing struggle between a small group of white people who think that America was founded on principles of white supremacy and should remain that way, and the rest of us.


Throughout US history, the white supremacists have seized power and implemented minority rule: secession, Jim Crow &amp; anti-immigration laws. Then the majority pushes back: the Civil War &amp; Reconstruction, The New Deal.
The current GOP is a backlash against Brown v Board of Education (the Supreme Court case that declared racial segregation in schools unconstitutional.)
Richardson traces in detail how that backlash happened, and how today&#x27;s backlash echoes the language and attitudes of the Confederacy.
She shows Nixon and others tied taxes to &quot;redistributing wealth&quot; to &quot;undeserving&quot; people as a way to get lower income racists aboard an economic agenda that hurt them.


I really have to make time to read this book!

                  <p>Last month we got a glimpse of the newest season of the Apple+ series For All Mankind (&quot;Imagine a world where the global space race never ended.&quot;) in the form of a teaser trailer that did not give a whole lot away. Well, a proper trailer has dropped and it looks like the gang will be colonizing Mars and harvesting precious metals from asteroids. as I wrote last month:
Is it just me or, if you tilt your head and squint, can you see For All Mankind as a prequel/origin story for The Expanse?


It is maybe too much to ask of a prestige drama these days, but it would be cool to see the birth &amp; development of a Belter-like language a la the beginnings of an Antarctic accent.

                  <p>How do I navigate grief and hopelessness after a tragedy? How can I get through my grief and sadness? Sitting with grief can feel like we&#x27;re frozen in shock or being pulled between heavy feelings and numbness. In this calming visualization, Headspace Meditation and Mindfulness Teacher Dora Kamau teaches us that grief is non-linear and how to practice self-compassion throughout each phase of grief. We&#x27;ll learn ways to be present with our grief or intense sadness so that we can allow our emotions to move through us instead of feeling stuck.

                  <p>Over 130 animators, actors, filmmakers, and even puppeteers joined forces to remake a 1994 episode of the TV show Frasier called My Coffee With Niles. The episode was split into 185 sections, each 6-12 seconds long, and a different animator or filmmaker took charge of each section. Love this...just an incredible array of styles on display here.

                  <p>I ran across this Slate piece by George Saunders yesterday and thought it was worth reposting. (Content warning: this article lists many violent acts, none of which are performed.)
At precisely 9 in the morning, working with focus and stealth, our entire membership succeeded in simultaneously beheading no one. At 10, Phase II began, during which our entire membership did not force a single man to suck another man&#x27;s penis. Also, none of us blew himself/herself up in a crowded public place. No civilians were literally turned inside out via our powerful explosives. In addition, at 11, in Phase III, zero (0) planes were flown into buildings.
During Phase IV, just after lunch, we were able to avoid bulldozing a single home. Furthermore, we set, on roads in every city, in every nation in the world, a total of zero (0) roadside bombs which, not being there, did not subsequently explode, killing/maiming a total of nobody. No bombs were dropped, during the lazy afternoon hours, on crowded civilian neighborhoods, from which, it was observed, no post-bomb momentary silences were then heard. These silences were, in all cases, followed by no unimaginable, grief-stricken bellows of rage, and/or frantic imprecations to a deity. No sleeping baby was awakened from an afternoon nap by the sudden collapse and/or bursting into flame of his/her domicile during Phase IV.


It&#x27;s a timely reminder of the overwhelming huge number of people in the world who are not militant extremists — but also of the power held by the tiny minority that are.

                  <p>Hey all. I&#x27;m going to be launching a new thing here soon (more on that in a few days), but you may have already noticed some changes around here. Design tweaks mostly. What you don&#x27;t see is that I pretty much ripped out the main guts of the site and rewrote a key piece of it...painful but necessary for some upcoming features. Hooooopefully it&#x27;s all working properly, but let me know if you see anything amiss? Especially with the membership stuff?
Anyway, one of the changes that people using RSS/newsreaders to read the site will have noticed is that the Quick Links are no longer bundled up into a few digests/day...they now arrive as they&#x27;re posted, one at a time. So if you got a bunch of old Quick Links clogging up your feedreader this morning, sorry about that — it should be a one-time thing.
Also regarding the RSS feed: the QL RSS items do not have titles (they are optional IIRC) and I&#x27;m getting a glimpse of the ways in which various newsreaders, uh, deal with title-less items. 😬 I&#x27;ve tested Feedly and Feedbin, but if you use another newsreader, would you mind emailing me a screenshot of how it handles these title-less Quick Links? Thanks!
Update: Ok, I&#x27;ve got FreshRSS, Newsblur, Unread, Reeder, NetNewsWire, Newsify, Newsboat, Inoreader, The Old Reader, Tiny Tiny RSS, Vienna, and a few others. I think I&#x27;m all set, thank you!

                  <p>You may have previously read about the Citicorp Center. Joe Morgenstern wrote about the Manhattan skyscraper in a classic New Yorker piece from 1995. The building was built incorrectly and might have blown over in a stiff wind if not for a timely intervention on the part of a mystery architecture student and the head structural engineer on the project.
Tells about designer William J. LeMessurier, who was structural consultant to the architect Hugh Stubbins, Jr. They set their 59-story tower on four massive nine-story-high stilts and used an unusual, chevron-shaped system of wind braces. LeMessurier had established the strength of those braces in perpendicular winds. Now, in the spirit of intellectual play, in his Harvard class, he wanted to see if they were just as strong in winds hitting from 45 degrees. He discovered the design flaw and during wind tunnel tests in Ontario learned the weakest joint was at the building&#x27;s 30th floor.

	
The whole piece is here and well worth a read. Last month, the excellent 99% Invisible did a radio show about Citicorp Center and added a new bit of information to the story: the identity of the mystery student who prodded LeMessurier to think more deeply about the structural integrity of his building. (via @bdeskin, who apparently factchecked Morgenstern&#x27;s piece back in the day)

                  <p>You have likely heard Yo-Yo Ma play his most famous piece before. Maybe even dozens of times. But Ma&#x27;s rendition of Bach&#x27;s Cello Suite No. 1 takes on a whole new dimension when accompanied by a babbling brook and bird calls in the forests of the Great Smoky Mountains. A lovely moment of peace in a world that could really use some right now.

                  <p>Nothing is faster than the speed of light. But compared to the unimaginable size of the Universe, light is actually extremely slow. This video is 45 minutes long and during that time, a photon emitted from the Sun1 will only travel through a portion of our solar system.

In our terrestrial view of things, the speed of light seems incredibly fast. But as soon as you view it against the vast distances of the universe, it&#x27;s unfortunately very slow. This animation illustrates, in realtime, the journey of a photon of light emitted from the sun and traveling across a portion of the solar system.

	
It takes light more than 43 minutes to travel to Jupiter and even to travel the diameter of the Sun takes 4.6 seconds. (thx, andy)
To even fight its way out of the Sun is an incredible journey for a photon. The Sun is so dense that a photon generated at the core is absorbed and re-emitted trillions of times by hydrogen nuclei on its way out. By some estimates, it may take up to 40,000 years for a photon to escape the Sun&#x27;s surface and head on out to the cold reaches of space.↩

                  <p>Photographer Reuben Wu was commissioned by Apple to take some of his wonderful light-painted photos with Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max in a project called The Inner Landscape.
So proud to be one of the first photographers to reveal a new series of images captured on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and celebrate its launch. &quot;The Inner Landscape&quot; is a series of six unearthly places that feel more intimate than epic, more ambiguous than explicit, making up a body of work that feels cohesive through its sense of connection and psychological space.


I love Wu&#x27;s work. More information about this project can be found at Colossal, Petapixel, and on Wu&#x27;s Instagram.

                  <p>Amazon has a bunch of stuff on sale today &amp; tomorrow for an &quot;event&quot; they&#x27;re calling Prime Big Deal Days. I&#x27;m not going to do a big roundup here, but here are a few things you might be interested in if you&#x27;re an Amazon shopper:
Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Gen) with Lightning connector for $189 (24% off). This is the lowest price I&#x27;ve seen on these; they&#x27;re the best headphones I&#x27;ve ever owned. Apple just released a newer version of these (nearly the same product except for a USB-C connector on the case) and the low price is probably to clear out inventory. Both versions charge just fine with a MagSafe or Qi-certified charger, so why not get the cheaper one if you charge that way and don&#x27;t care about the small differences? Update: Both versions are the same price (I don&#x27;t think they were this morning). So get the newer ones!
Apple 2020 MacBook Air Laptop M1 for $750 (25% off). This is my laptop. I love this laptop. When my daughter needed a new computer for high school, I bought her one of these.



Amazon Kindle Paperwhite for $95 (32% off). I read all my books on this. Lightweight and the battery lasts forever. And it charges with USB-3 so that&#x27;s one less cable to haul around.



SAF Aranet4 Home CO2 Monitor for $159 (36% off). This is everyone&#x27;s pick for the best indoor air quality monitor.



Splendor Board Game for $20.49 (54% off). This has been a recent hit around our house...very easy to play but still difficult to master.



KitchenAid 3.5 Qt. Stand Mixer for $260 (32% off). This is KitchenAid&#x27;s smaller stand mixer, which is lighter and takes up less counter space in smaller kitchens.

You can find more deals on the Prime Big Deal Days page.

                  <p>Planet Earth III will begin airing later this year on BBC and, presumably, at some later time in the US. The latest installment in the legendary series, 17 years after the first one was released, will once again be presented by Sir David Attenborough, now 97 years old and still as enthusiastic about sharing the wonders of nature as he ever was.
&#x27;The opening of the series with David was filmed in the beautiful British countryside in exactly the location where Charles Darwin used to walk whilst thinking-over his Earth-shaking ideas about evolution. It seemed the perfect place for David to introduce Planet Earth III and remind us of both the wonders and the fragility of our planet. ....and for him, of course, the sun shined under blue skies one of the only days it did all summer!.&#x27;


The video above is a quick first look at the series and here&#x27;s a trailer as well:

Looking forward to this...the Planet Earth series is still the gold standard for nature documentaries.

I&#x27;ve had history with these particular two characters, but until recently that history of going back and forth was entirely based on aesthetic.
Then React came along (or rather I climbed aboard) and I found myself always adding the trailing slash to elements, regardless of whether I was writing React or plain old HTML.
Then today, I got bit in the arse by a self closing tag and it reminds me of Jake&#x27;s very recent post on the exact same thing.</p>

So much fun...you get to say &quot;wait, zoom in, enhance, whoa, back up&quot; to yourself while playing. My top score is 14103...what&#x27;d you get? p.s. Using Google in another tab is cheating!

                  <p>Afbeelding: Low-tech Magazine workshop in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Poster: Marie Verdeil. Image: Sara Vercauteren 



The workshop takes place on behalf of the “House of the Future”, a spinoff of the Human Power Plant project. The House of the Future will bring the Human Power Plant’s “Human Powered Neighbourhood” scenario to life in Bospolder-Tussendijken, Rotterdam, in the coming years. You can already get a taste of it at the Museum Boijmans van Beuningen’s online exhibition (in Dutch).
Since this community will run largely on human power, we need human power plants. Therefore, Kris De Decker and Marie Verdeil organise an open and collaborative workshop where we will build a fully working bicycle generator based on a second-hand spinning bike. You are welcome to learn, experiment, teach, and help.
During the workshop, we will mount a generator on the bike, build a control panel, and modify devices to run on low voltage. This bicycle generator will be specifically designed to serve as a power source in the communal workshop, so that we can use it to build more stuff we need (including more bike generators).
Programme:
Tuesday 10 October (14h-18h): open day House of the Future
Wednesday 11 October (15h-17h): introduction workshop
Thursday 12 October (10h-17h): workshop
Friday, October 13 (14h-19h): workshop
Saturday, October 14 (14h-17h): workshop
We speak Dutch, English, French, and Spanish. The introduction (11 oct) will be in Dutch only.
Admission is free. To participate: just walk in (Jan Kobellstraat 56A, Rotterdam) or send an email to contact [] huisvandetoekomst [] org.
All future events will be published on our events page.

                  <p>A few weeks ago I gave a keynote at Strange Loop
called Making Hard Things Easy. It’s about why I think some things are hard
to learn and ideas for how we can make them easier.
Here’s the video, as well as the slides and a transcript of (roughly) what I
said in the talk.

the transcript





Hello, Strange Loop! Strange Loop is one of the first places I
spoke almost 10 years ago and I&#x27;m so honored to be back here today for the
last one. Can we have one more round of applause for the organizers?












I often give talks about things that I&#x27;m excited about,
or that I think are really fun.



But today, I want to talk about something that I&#x27;m a little bit mad about,
which is that sometimes things that seem like they should be basic take me 10
years or 20 years to learn, way l…</p>

Fast and cheap transportation props up industrial societies, both for the moving of people and cargo. However, our transport networks are very wasteful of energy and utterly dependent on fossil fuels. In this series of articles, Low-tech Magazine critically examines the call for electrified vehicles, which depend on unsustainable batteries and infrastructures.
Much more important than the chosen power source is vehicle design: size, weight, speed, acceleration, and comfort level. Furthermore, public transport is more resource efficient, and we could electrify it without batteries.
The book’s second part deals with long-distance transportation: planes, trains, sailing ships, and ocean liners. By placing transportation technology in a historical context, Low-tech Magazine challenges our high-tech approach to sustainability and highlights the possibilities of alternative solutions.

                  <p>From The Economist on the occasion of the award of the Nobel Prize for Medicine to Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman for their work that led to the development of the Covid-19 mRNA vaccines, a lovely short appreciation of vaccines.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) says that vaccines have saved more from death than any other medical invention. It is a hard claim to gainsay. Vaccines protect people from disease cheaply, reliably and in remarkable numbers. And their capacity to do so continues to grow. In 2021 the who approved a first vaccine against malaria; this week it approved a second.
Vaccines are not only immensely useful; they also embody something beautifully human in their combination of care and communication. Vaccines do not trick the immune system, as is sometimes said; they educate and train it. As a resource of good public health, they allow doctors to whisper words of warning into the cells of their patients. In an age short of trust, this intimacy between government policy and an individual&#x27;s immune system is easily misconstrued as a threat. But vaccines are not conspiracies or tools of control: they are molecular loving-kindness.


The WHO says that vaccines currently prevent 4-5 million deaths per year. The CDC points to a paper that says that more than 50 million death can be prevented  between 2021 and 2030. Vaccination is nothing short of a scientific miracle. (via eric topol)

                  <p>The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research recently conducted a poll asking Americans about their religious beliefs and found that about 30% of American adults are non-religious (which they refer to as &quot;the nones&quot;, presumably after the book by Ryan Burge).
The decades-long rise of the nones — a diverse, hard-to-summarize group — is one of the most talked about phenomena in U.S. religion. They are reshaping America&#x27;s religious landscape as we know it.
In U.S. religion today, &quot;the most important story without a shadow of a doubt is the unbelievable rise in the share of Americans who are nonreligious,&quot; said Ryan Burge, a political science professor at Eastern Illinois University and author of &quot;The Nones,&quot; a book on the phenomenon.
The nones account for a large portion of Americans, as shown by the 30% of U.S. adults who claim no religious affiliation in a survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.
Other major surveys say the nones have been steadily increasing for as long as three decades.
So who are they?
They&#x27;re the atheists, the agnostics, the &quot;nothing in particular.&quot; They&#x27;re the &quot;spiritual but not religious,&quot; and those who are neither or both. They span class, gender, age, race and ethnicity.
While the nones&#x27; vast diversity splinters them into myriad subgroups, most of them have this in common:
They. Really. Don&#x27;t. Like. Organized. Religion.


But a dislike of organized religion among the nonreligious doesn&#x27;t necessarily translate into atheism or agnosticism: 43% of &quot;the nones&quot; say they believe in God.

                  <p>This video from Practical Engineering offers a brief explanation of dozens of different types of railcars, from passenger train cars like the dining car &amp; sleeper car to freight cars like the boxcar, tank car, and hopper cars (for hauling things like sand or grain) to specialized cars the rail companies use to build and maintain their routes like rail grinders, snowplows, and track geometry cars.
Trains are one of the most fascinating engineered systems in the world, and they&#x27;re out there, right in the open for anyone to have a look! Once you start paying attention, its pretty satisfying to look for all the different types of railcars that show up on the tracks.


They even made a little checklist to use for your beginner trainspotting. (via the kid should see this)

                  <p>Erik Wernquist made his short film One Revolution Per Minute to explore his &quot;fascination with artificial gravity in space&quot;. The film shows what it would be like to travel on a large, circular space station, 900 meters (0.56 miles) in diameter that rotates a 1 rpm. Even at that slow speed, which generates 0.5 g at the outermost shell, I was surprised to see how quickly the scenery (aka the Earth, Moon, etc.) was rotating and how disorienting it would be as a passenger.
Realistically - and admittedly somewhat reluctantly — I assume that while building a structure like this is very much possible, it would be quite impractical for human passengers.
Putting aside the perhaps most obvious problem with those wide windows being a security hazard, I believe that the perpetually spinning views would be extremely nauseating for most humans, even for short visits. Even worse, I suspect — when it comes to the comfort of the experience — would be the constantly moving light and shadows from the sun.


I calculated that the outer ring of the space station is moving at 105.4 mph with respect to the center. That&#x27;s motoring right along — no wonder everything outside is spinning so quickly.

From an accompanying article:

                  <p>This is a treat: almost 25 minutes of legendary director Martin Scorsese talking about how he made his most iconic movies, from Mean Streets and Raging Bull to Gangs of New York and The Irishman. You have to laugh at the number of times he says, &quot;Well, I didn&#x27;t want to make this film, but...&quot; From an accompanying profile/interview with Scorsese (which is quite good as well):
It is a peculiar fact about Martin Scorsese that he does not enjoy actually making movies. &quot;I don&#x27;t mean to be funny,&quot; he said, &quot;but, the thing is, you get up real early.&quot; And Scorsese has never been a morning person. For most of his life, he recalled, &quot;I&#x27;d stay up late watching movies on TV or reading late, or doing homework late, or trying to write scripts late. I lived at night and the streets were dark, and I never saw the light. It took me many years to understand where the sun set and where the sun rose. I didn&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m not kidding. I learned it in LA. When you&#x27;re going on Sunset Boulevard and you hit the Pacific Coast Highway and it&#x27;s seven o&#x27;clock and the sun is setting — it&#x27;s right there.&quot;
He likes to borrow a complaint from Kubrick. &quot;They said, &#x27;What&#x27;s the hardest thing about directing?&#x27; He said, &#x27;Getting out of the car.&#x27; Because once you get out of the car, the questions start.&quot; Now, when Scorsese gets out of the car in the morning, he looks at his AD and says, &quot;What can&#x27;t I have today?&quot;

                  <p>You really have to applaud the effort here: YouTuber Todd in the Shadows made a 33-minutes supercut of every song he could find that stops, even momentarily, on the word &quot;stop&quot;. Here are the ground rules:
If there was even the briefest of stops, I counted it. It&#x27;s okay if the band holds the note rather than complete silence. But the entire band has to stop, not just a couple instruments; the singer can keep singing though.


I gotta say I did not watch the whole thing, but the very last clip is *kisses fingers*. (via @peterme)

                  <p>Megan Gray on a disturbing piece of information that was revealed in the antitrust case against Google: their search engine replaces some search queries with others that generate more commercial results (and therefore more money for the company). Here&#x27;s how it works:
Google likely alters queries billions of times a day in trillions of different variations. Here&#x27;s how it works. Say you search for &quot;children&#x27;s clothing.&quot; Google converts it, without your knowledge, to a search for &quot;NIKOLAI-brand kidswear,&quot; making a behind-the-scenes substitution of your actual query with a different query that just happens to generate more money for the company, and will generate results you weren&#x27;t searching for at all. It&#x27;s not possible for you to opt out of the substitution. If you don&#x27;t get the results you want, and you try to refine your query, you are wasting your time. This is a twisted shopping mall you can&#x27;t escape.


Yuuuck. I think it might be time to switch away from Google search — its results have been getting worse for years and it seems like the company doesn&#x27;t care too much about fixing it. I&#x27;ve been hearing good things about Kagi and there&#x27;s always DuckDuckGo.

                  <p>Designed by architect Thomas Randall-Page, the Cody Dock rolling footbridge opens with a &quot;surprising and playful motion&quot; to let boats pass through by simply rolling out of the way.
The bridge rolls on undulating rails cast into the concrete abutments on either bank. Ballast fills the top of each square portal, countering the weight of the bridge deck that connects them. This symmetry allows the whole bridge structure to smoothly role through 180 degrees to a fully inverted position facilitating movement of boats from the river to the dock. This finely balanced is this system allows the 13 tonne bridge to be operated via hand winches only.


Here&#x27;s a video about the then-proposed bridge from 2019 that shows the unique rolling mechanism:

And here&#x27;s a video from earlier this year that shows the design process and how the finished bridge works:

                  <p>Wow, Nicholas Rougeux has restored John Gould’s A Monograph of the Trochilidæ, or Family of Humming-Birds, which was published between 1848 &amp; 1887 and contains hand-colored lithographic depictions of almost every single hummingbird species known to exist at the time.



From Rougeux&#x27;s page about the project:
The monograph is considered one of the finest examples of ornithological illustration ever produced, as well as a scientific masterpiece. Gould&#x27;s passion for hummingbirds led him to travel to various parts of the world, such as North America, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, to observe and collect specimens. He also received many specimens from other naturalists and collectors.


The image at the top of the post is the gorgeous poster that Rougeux created from the drawings in Gould&#x27;s monograph...you can order some for your walls and read a making-of.
See also other projects by Rougeux that I&#x27;ve posted about.

                  <p>Perhaps the most prominent part of the most well-known painting of Henry VIII (a now-lost work by Hans Holbein the Younger) is the giant codpiece poking through the male-heirless king&#x27;s tunic. Evan Puschak analyzes the painting and fills us in on what makes this a particularly effective work of 16th-century propaganda.
Puschak had some fun with this one...I lol&#x27;d at &quot;triple dick&quot;, which under no circumstances should you google (like I did) at work or really anywhere else. Although, &quot;triple dick art history&quot; did lead me to this interesting piece on &quot;ostentatio genitalium&quot;:
Ostentatio genitalium (the display of the genitals) refers to disparate traditions in Renaissance visual culture of attributing formal, thematic, and theological significance to the penis of Jesus.


This bit got me laughing again:
...these Renaissance images shock us because they are so frequently ithyphallic: Christ has risen, but not in the way we have come to expect.

                  <p>These days, instead of writing down lyrics and bringing them to the studio to record, many rappers are using the improvisational &quot;punch-in method&quot; to craft songs during the recording session.
Is this good for the music? The jury is out, even within hip-hop. But in this behind-the-scenes video — the latest entry in our Diary of a Song series, which documents how popular music is created — we track the generational shift through exclusive studio footage of young rappers like Doechii, Veeze and Lil Gotit, plus interviews with genre veterans including the artist Killer Mike and the producer Just Blaze, to track this creative shift and its effects on the still-experimental genre of hip-hop, 50 years after its birth.


Interesting technique, but there is definitely some music in that video that is not for me.

It&#x27;s about the climate emergency. It&#x27;s hopeful.

                  <p>Hey everyone! This is the list of all the changes we&#x27;ve done to our projects and apps during the month of September. We&#x27;ll also be reporting in our on position in the world, and on our future plans.
Summary Of Changes
Wiktopher, adapted Solresol, edited other conlangs.
Niju, fixed a drawing bug.
Oquonie, working on the Playdate version.

Pino returned to the Victoria docks a little early this year so Devine could go to Strange Loop 2023. We had a lovely sail that day, with clear skies, and 10 kts on the beam. Despite being a little food and sleep deprived, Devine&#x27;s presentation went well, we will share the recording here once it is released.
Rek has been busy editing Wiktopher, finessing the conlangs featured in the story. One of the featured languages is Ilken, a whistled language, designed for long-distance communication, and playable with instruments. A few years ago Devine designed a language for it, but we decided to instead use a modern variation of Solresol, a musical language by Jean-François Sudre. Rek drew a fanart of the mascot of Solresol, and Devine a communication lantern.
Currently, Devine is working at translating Thousand Rooms(Famimi Remisolla) in Solresol as practice. We&#x27;re also editing a Brazilian Portuguese version, to be released next month.
We&#x27;ve been toying with the idea of making an audiobook for the story, and asked Paul B. to use their voice synthesis tool Gesture to try and hear what a poem in Ilken(Solresol) sounds like. The result was so lovely that it made Rek cry of joy.
Rek&#x27;s sketch thread(Mastodon) is still going. Devine will be producing a lot more art next month for Drawtober!
Pino book club
We are reading J.D. Salinger&#x27;s Catcher in the Rye, and B. F. Skinner&#x27;s Walden Two.

                  <p>Danielle Currie creates these amazing hand-embroidered artworks of satellite views of Earth.
Danielle Currie&#x27;s intricate hand embroidered pieces capture the beauty of Earth from a satellite view. Each piece is named with the latitude and longitude coordinates, providing observers the opportunity to independently explore the area which inspired the piece.


Here&#x27;s the Landsat 8 satellite photo that inspired the embroidery at the top of the post.
Currie sells the original artworks as well as some prints of her work.
P.S. Apparently I&#x27;ve posted more than a little about embroidery over the years, so I gave the subject a tag page. There&#x27;s some cool stuff in there...I&#x27;d forgotten about The Embroidered Computer.

Favorite facts: 1. Early on, Luke Skywalker&#x27;s nickname was &quot;Wormy&quot;. Wormy! 2. The actor who portrayed Vader, David Prowse, spoke his dialogue on set not knowing he would be dubbed over. Because of his West Country accent, the other cast members referred to Prowse as Darth Farmer.
Speaking of Harrison Ford&#x27;s carpentry, the new biography of Joan Didion has a good story about that time Didion and her husband John Dunne hired Ford to do some construction for them.
Off and on, for over six month, the Dunnes engaged a construction crew to expand the waterside deck, install waxed pine b…</p>

As I wrote in a post about the Mississippi River meander maps designed by Army Corps of Engineers cartographer Harold Fisk:
Fisk&#x27;s maps represent the memory of a mighty river, with thousands of years of course changes compressed into a single image by a clever mapmaker with an artistic eye. Looking at them, you&#x27;re invited to imagine the Mississippi as it was during the European exploration of the Americas in the 1500s, during the Cahokia civilization in the 1200s (when this city&#x27;s population matched London&#x27;s), when the first humans came upon the river more than 12,000 years ago, and even back to before humans, when mammoths, camels, dire wolves, and giant beavers roamed the land and gazed upon the river.


Coe has put 4K versions of these images up on Flickr in both landscape and portrait aspect ratios. They work really well for computer and phone wallpapers — I&#x27;ve been using this one on various devices since I first saw it years ago.

We&#x27;ve sold quite of a few of them so far, and I&#x27;ve just sent off the first of hopefully many donations to the National Network of Abortion Funds to the tune of $1288 to support their mission of working towards a world &quot;where all reproductive options, including abortion, are valued and free of coercion&quot;.
Thanks so much to everyone who has bought a shirt so far! If you&#x27;d like to purchase one of your own, you can check out the original post for more information and the ordering links.

                  <p>The Atlantic has an adapted excerpt from Heather Cox Richardson&#x27;s new book, Democracy Awakening: The Origins of the Socialist Slur. It begins:
For years after World War II, the &quot;liberal consensus&quot; — the New Deal idea that the federal government had a role to play in regulating business, providing a basic social safety net, and promoting infrastructure — was a true consensus. It was so widely popular that in 1950, the critic Lionel Trilling wrote of the United States that &quot;liberalism is not only the dominant but even the sole intellectual tradition.&quot;
But the Supreme Court&#x27;s 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision declaring segregation in public schools unconstitutional tied the federal government to ensuring not just economic equality, but also civil rights. Opponents of the liberal consensus argued that the newly active federal government was misusing tax dollars taken from hardworking white men to promote civil rights for &quot;undeserving&quot; Black people. The troops President Dwight Eisenhower sent to Little Rock Central High School in 1957, for example, didn&#x27;t come cheap. The government&#x27;s defense of civil rights redistributed wealth, they said, and so was virtually socialism.

If I&#x27;d planned further ahead, I would have done something similarly spectacular, like all of us (and there are even more guest hosts and friends-of-Kottke now) arriving in Vermont to take him on a party train to Montreal. (We need more party trains. We rented a party train -- technically just a private car -- for my wife Karen McGrane&#x27;s 50th birthday, and it was amazing.) But we will just have to settle for this short solo tribute.

Jason runs the best blog on the planet, and he&#x27;s been doing it for half his life. But blog posts rarely go viral any more, and Jason&#x27;s style was never about controversy or provocat…</p>

                  <p>Scientific American: How to Survive Mercury in Retrograde. &quot;What does Mercury in retrograde have to do with electronics malfunctioning or social interactions taking a negative turn? Well, nothing.&quot;
Wow, all 67 episodes of Moonlighting will be available to stream on Hulu starting Oct 10. I loved this show as a kid and am curious to see how it holds up.
Corporate America Promised to Hire a Lot More People of Color. It Actually Did. &quot;The year after Black Lives Matter protests, the S&amp;P 100 added more than 300,000 jobs — 94% went to people of color.&quot;
This has greatly improved my macOS Notes experience: you can change the link color from that what-were-they-thinking yellow to a useful color by going to System Settings / Appearance and changing the &quot;Accent color&quot;.
New York&#x27;s Hottest Steakhouse Was a Fake, Until Saturday Night. How an in-joke amongst an extremely online group of friends became a restaurant/performance art piece for one night. &quot;The menu purported to follow the life cycle of a cow.&quot;

                  <p>Heather Cox Richardson, author of the excellent Letters from an American newsletter, has a new book out today about the health of American democracy: Democracy Awakening: Notes on the State of America. From Virginia Heffernan&#x27;s review of the book in the Washington Post:
She has an intriguing origin point for today&#x27;s afflictions: the New Deal. The first third of the book, which hurtles toward Donald Trump&#x27;s election, is as bingeable as anything on Netflix. &quot;Democracy Awakening&quot; starts in the 1930s, when Americans who&#x27;d been wiped out in the 1929 stock market crash were not about to let the rich demolish the economy again. New Deal programs designed to benefit ordinary people and prevent future crises were so popular that by 1960 candidates of both parties were advised to simply &quot;nail together&quot; coalitions and promise them federal funding. From 1946 to 1964, the liberal consensus — with its commitments to equality, the separation of church and state, and the freedoms of speech, press and religion — held sway.
But Republican businessmen, who had caused the crash, despised the consensus. Richardson&#x27;s account of how right-wingers appropriated the word &quot;socialism&quot; from the unrelated international movement is astute. When invoked to malign all government investment, &quot;socialism&quot; served to recruit segregationist Democrats, who could be convinced that the word meant Black people would take their money, and Western Democrats, who resented government protections on land and water. This new Republican Party created an ideology that coalesced around White Christianity and free markets.


Heffernan calls this first part of Richardson&#x27;s book &quot;the most lucid just-so story for Trump&#x27;s rise I&#x27;ve ever heard&quot;. I&#x27;m in the midst of two other books right now (The Vaster Wilds &amp; The Mountain in the Sea) but I might have to make room for a third.

                  <p>You just have to admire a chart that casually purports to show every single thing in the Universe in one simple 2D plot. The chart in question is from a piece in the most recent issue of the American Journal of Physics with the understated title of &quot;All objects and some questions&quot;.
In Fig. 2, we plot all the composite objects in the Universe: protons, atoms, life forms, asteroids, moons, planets, stars, galaxies, galaxy clusters, giant voids, and the Universe itself. Humans are represented by a mass of 70 kg and a radius of 50 cm (we assume sphericity), while whales are represented by a mass of 10^5 kg and a radius of 7 m.


The &quot;sub-Planckian unknown&quot; and &quot;forbidden by gravity&quot; sections of the chart makes the &quot;quantum uncertainty&quot; section seem downright normal — the paper collectively calls these &quot;unphysical regions&quot;. Lovely turns of phrase all.
But what does it all mean? My physics is too rusty to say, but I thought one of the authors&#x27; conjectures was particularly intriguing: &quot;Our plot of all objects also seems to suggest that the Universe is a black hole.&quot; Huh, cool.

                  <p>There I Ruined It is fast becoming one of my favorite web delights — musician Dustin Ballard remixes and mashes beloved songs in an attempt to ruin them. The video embedded above features Eminem&#x27;s Lose Yourself sung to the tune of the Super Mario Bros theme song...and it makes me laugh every time I watch it.
You can check out more of There I Ruined It on YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram.
P.S. My idea for a song to ruin: the Happy Days theme song, but it just keeps repeating the days of the week (&quot;Sunday Monday happy days / Tuesday Wednesday happy days...&quot;) in a loop, using the Shepard tone to (seemingly) keep the pitch ever-rising.

                  <p>As with any ageing blog, some of my outbound links are hitting either 404s or domains that are no longer active.
It&#x27;s understandable given that my blog is around 17 years old (at time of writing) and I know many others that have old blogs. If it&#x27;s a blog that embraces the web then it will link out. But for the visitor, opening a link that provides more context to what I&#x27;ve written and to be presented with a blank page is a bit of downer.
The archive.org is an amazing resource and I&#x27;ve wondered whether I should always link to the archive for my URLs - but I quickly decide linking to the &quot;real&quot; resource is the right thing to do. But how about when the page is long gone - and the how am I supposed to know when that happens?</p>

                  <p>I don&#x27;t know about you, but the title &quot;The Blood Collages of John Bingley Garland (ca. 1850–60)&quot; made me click pretty damn fast to see what sort of Victorian age shenanigans this dude was up to. From the Public Domain Review:
The Blood Book is handmade, folio-sized, with a handsome marbled endpaper and forty-three pages of exquisitely crafted decoupage. John Bingley Garland, the manuscript&#x27;s creator, used collage techniques, excising illustrations from other books to assemble elegant, balanced compositions. Most of the source material is Romantic engravings by William Blake and his ilk, but there are also brilliantly colored flowers and fruits. Snakes are a favorite motif, butterflies another. A small bird is centered on every page. The space between the images is filled with tiny hand-written script that reads like a staccato sermon. &quot;One! yet has larger bounties! to bestow! Joys! Powers! untasted! In a World like this, Powers!&quot; etc.
The book&#x27;s reputation, however, rests on a decorative detail that overwhelms: To each page, Garland added languid, crimson drops in red India ink, hanging from the cut-out images like pendalogues from a chandelier. Blood drips from platters of grapes and tree boughs, statuaries and skeletons. Crosses seep, a cheetah drools, angels dangle bloody sashes. A bouquet of white chrysanthemums is spritzed.
To be clear, Garland&#x27;s blood is not that of surgery or crime or menses, but of religious iconography. He obviously intended the blood to represent Christ&#x27;s own.


The Blood Book are strikingly modern; as PDR states, Garland uses &quot;techniques usually dated to Cubism in the early twentieth century&quot; to make his collages. I love running across seemingly out-of-time objects like this.

                  <p>Elizabeth Spiers for the NY Times on how to apologize (given the recent spate of celebrity non-apologies): I Have a Question for the Famous People Who Have Tried to Apologize.
The first step in a good apology is acknowledging harm. The second is expressing genuine regret, and where possible, acknowledging our shortcoming. Our intentions are not always good. Sometimes we&#x27;re selfish. Sometimes we don&#x27;t know what we&#x27;re doing, and sometimes we fail to consider the consequences. If we can admit these things, it helps repair trust.
Then we vow, in good faith, to not perpetuate the same harm again.
The last step is repair. This means directly addressing the harm done — not via self-flagellation on YouTube nor with any expectation of forgiveness.


I posted about how to apologize a few years ago after reading Katie Heaney&#x27;s piece on, wait for it, celebrity non-apologies:
Here are the six components of an apology from Beth Polin:
1. An expression of regret — this, usually, is the actual &quot;I&#x27;m sorry.&quot;


I think about these components whenever giving or receiving apologies — it&#x27;s a great framework to keep in mind.

                  <p>NASA&#x27;s original logo looked something like this:

It was referred to, colloquially, as the meatball. In the 1970s, the meatball was switched out for the worm, a more Modernist take:

This logo was done by Richard Danne and Bruce Blackburn, and Danne wrote an essay about the experience.
And here is one of the most interesting exchanges I&#x27;ve ever witnessed in a design presentation:
Fletcher: &quot;I&#x27;m simply not comfortable with those letters, something is missing.&quot;
Others, not just the designers were stunned by this last comment. Then the discussion moved back to the strong red/rust color we were proposing. We had tried many other colors of course, including the more predictable blue range, but settled on red because it suggested action and animation. It seemed in spirit with the Can Do nature of the Space Agency.
Fletcher: And this color, red, it doesn&#x27;t make much sense to me.&quot;

	
NASA&#x27;s Graphics Standards Menu utilizing the worm logo can be seen here.

The space agency switched back to the original logo in 1992. Michael Bierut compared the two:
The worm is a great-looking word mark and looked fantastic on the spacecraft. By any objective measure, the worm was and is absolutely appropriate, and the meatball was and is an amateurish mess.

                  <p>European cities are transitioning to the use of cargo e-bikes and other micro-mobility solutions for package and other urban deliveries because they are safer, cleaner, and even faster in some cases than using vans or large trucks. The US isn&#x27;t making that same shift right now — this video from Vox explores why...and how we can move in that direction.
Fortunately, there&#x27;s a hero waiting in the wings: the e-cargo bike. Not only can these bad boys deliver packages in urban environments just as quickly (and sometimes faster) than delivery vans, they take up far less space and are much less likely to cause pedestrian deaths. Companies like Amazon, DHL, and UPS are using them in several European cities, but American cities haven&#x27;t followed suit. 
In this video, we explore why that is, and lay out some of the big steps American cities would need to take to join the e-bike delivery revolution.

                  <p>As a tribute to Brian Eno, visual artist Thomas Blanchard made this video of Emerald and Stone, a 2010 song that Eno collaborated on with Jon Hopkins &amp; Leo Abrahams. According to Blanchard, he made the video with no digital visual effects — &quot;the visual compositions have been created out of paint, oil and soap liquid.&quot;
Eno himself is still working and mentoring younger artists...he and Fred Again released an ambient album back in May.

                  <p>Here&#x27;s a fun thought experiment: can you destroy a black hole? Nuclear weapons probably won&#x27;t work but what about antimatter? Or anti black holes? In this video, Kurzgesagt explores the possibilities and impossibilities. This part baked my noodle (in a good way):
Contrary to widespread belief, the singularity of a black hole is not really &quot;at its center&quot;. It&#x27;s in the future of whatever crosses the horizon. Black holes warp the universe so drastically that, at the event horizon, space and time switch their roles. Once you cross it, falling towards the center means going towards the future. That&#x27;s why you cannot escape: Stopping your fall and turning back would be just as impossible as stopping time and traveling to the past. So the singularity is actually in your future, not &quot;in front of you&quot;. And just like you can&#x27;t see your own future, you won&#x27;t see the singularity until you hit it.

                  <p>Danny Cortes took up making patinated miniatures of familiar NYC objects during the pandemic and it turned into a full-time vocation for him. He spoke to the NY Times about how his work puts him in the flow state:
&quot;I loved that when I worked on a piece, I didn&#x27;t think about my problems — my divorce, the pandemic,&quot; said Mr. Cortes. &quot;It was an escape — like I&#x27;m meditating, literally floating. I didn&#x27;t have a problem in the world. I wanted that high again, I kept chasing that.&quot;


Love that and love the miniatures...they are crazy realistic.
Blighted façades and distressed structures are the very scenes which fuel Daniel&#x27;s attention to detail. The work to produce each piece is arduous and requires great precision to achieve such realism. Daniel had developed techniques that can give a model an aged, distressed or patinated style. He also recreates miniature scaled vintage advertising posters and graffiti art on his models. Daniel&#x27;s miniature models make unique collectable creations that will take you on a gritty romantic journey through New York that everyday passers by have overlooked.

                  <p>Using a phrase popularized by reproductive justice activist Renee Bracey Sherman, The National Network of Abortion Funds teamed up with Molly Crabapple and Padma Lakshmi to produce a video about their mission to support abortion access in the US.
In order for abortion to be truly an option, it must not only be legal, but actually available, without the shame. It&#x27;s time we worked together towards a world where all people have the power and resources to care for and support their bodies, identities, and health — for themselves and their families. We need to take the hassle, hustle, and harassment out of healthcare. It&#x27;s time to change the conversation about abortion, to make it a real option, available to all people without shame or judgment. We all love someone who has had an abortion, whether we know it or not.


The video is three years old and from the very first line (&quot;Abortion is legal in all 50 states&quot;), you can tell how much the situation has changed in the United States — and how the NNAF&#x27;s mission is even more urgent. If you&#x27;d like to join me in donating, step right this way.

                  <p>On the Console Repair Discord I&#x27;d offered to fix a Pokémon Sapphire cart that was initially not working, but then went to a repair shop and came back with a leg on one of the chips missing.
The work would require grinding down the silicone of the chip to expose the internals of the missing leg and jump it to the solder pad. The cart was also missing a resistor and capacitor.
I decided to start by completely removing the chips from the board, and I&#x27;m glad I did because underneath I found a lot of corrosion and junk from either time or previous attempts. The solder joints also looked dull which suggested to me that it would benefit from a reflow.
Once this was done, the board was cleaned (thankfully there was no trace repair required), I replaced the chips and went about grinding the ROM chip to expose the broken leg.

Once exposed, I created a jumper using solder to the pad, installed a few missing components (a capacitor and resistor had been lost previously) and it was all back to life.</p>

                  <p>At some point in the 1970s, Lego included the following letter to parents in its sets:

The text reads:
The urge to create is equally strong in all children. Boys and girls.
It&#x27;s imagination that counts. Not skill. You build whatever comes into your head, the way you want it. A bed or a truck. A dolls house or a spaceship.
A lot of boys like dolls houses. They&#x27;re more human than spaceships. A lot of girls prefer spaceships. They&#x27;re more exciting than dolls houses.
The most important thing is to the put the right material in the their hands and let them create whatever appeals to them.

	
The letter seems like the sort of thing that might be fake, but Robbie Gonzalez of io9 presents the case for its authenticity.
In our home, Lego currently rules the roost...the kids (a boy and a girl) spend more time building with Lego than doing anything else. This weekend, they worked together to build a beach scene, with a house, pool, lifeguard station, car, pond (for skimboarding), and surfers. Dollhouse stuff basically. Then they raced around the house with Lego spaceships and race cars. Nailed it, 1970s Lego.
Update: QZ confirms, the letter is genuine.

                  <p>Every year at Burning Man (pandemic years aside), Tycho does a ~2hr DJ set around sunrise and then releases it on Soundcloud — here&#x27;s the 2023 version.

I&#x27;ve been listening to this for the past week and while I don&#x27;t like it quite as much as the sets from previous years, it&#x27;s definitely something to add to the rotation of chill work music.
See Tycho&#x27;s BM sets from 2022, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015, and 2014. Pretty much the only reason I&#x27;d ever want to go to Burning Man (esp after this year) is to catch this set in person sometime.

                  <p>This year, the React team unveiled something they&#x27;ve been quietly researching for years: an official way to run React components exclusively on the server. This is a significant paradigm shift, and it&#x27;s caused a whole lot of confusion in the React community. In this tutorial, we&#x27;ll explore this new world, and build an intuition for how it works, and how we can take advantage of it.</p>

The loud, expensive weaponry arrived in the state in 2019 and have upset and angered residents ever since.
A sudden roar announced that the military jets were taking to the sky again.
Julia Parise&#x27;s son had developed a routine for whenever this happened: He would look to his mother and assess whether it was &quot;one of them&quot; — the F-35 fighter jets that had become such a constant presence in his young life — before asking her to cover his ears. He might do it himself, recalling aloud her reassurances as he did: &quot;They won&#x27;t hurt me. They won&#x27;t hurt me.&quot;

                  <p>When you start something new, how do you know where you&#x27;re going to end up? Most of the time, you don&#x27;t — you stumble around for awhile, exploring uncertainly until, slowly, things start to make sense. That messy journey is all part of the process. Designer Damien Newman and I have teamed up with Cotton Bureau to make some t-shirts featuring his Design Squiggle that illustrate this untidy pattern of creativity. The Process Tee is available in two varieties — light design on dark fabric and dark design on light fabric — and 50% of the profits will be donated to a charitable organization (more on that below).
Newman originally came up with the Design Squiggle (aka The Process of Design Squiggle) more than 20 years ago to explain how design worked to some of his clients. Here&#x27;s his descriptio…</p>

                  <p>The Royal Observatory Greenwich in London has announced the winners of the Astronomy Photographer of the Year 2023 competition and as you can see from the selection above, there were some amazing shots. From top to bottom:
Runwei Xu and Binyu Wang for their photo of The Running Chicken Nebula.
Eduardo Schaberger Poupeau for capturing a question mark on the Sun. I will never tire of looking at the detail of the Sun&#x27;s surface.



Angel An. &quot;This is not, as it might first appear, an enormous extraterrestrial, but the lower tendrils of a sprite (red lightning)! This rarely seen electrical discharge occurs much higher in the atmosphere than normal lightning (and indeed, despite the name, is created by a different mechanism), giving the image an intriguingly misleading sense of scale.&quot;



Mehmet Ergün. More Sun!



Marcel Drechsler, Xavier Strottner and Yann Sainty for their shot of the Andromeda galaxy.

The last shot was the overall winner. While not as dramatic as some of the others, it documented the discovery of a previously unknown feature of a nearby cosmic neighbor:
The Andromeda galaxy is the closest spiral galaxy to our own Milky Way, and one of the most photographed deep-sky objects. Yet this particular photo, captured by an international trio of amateur astronomers, revealed a feature that had never been seen before: a huge plasma arc, stretching out across space right next to the Andromeda galaxy.
&quot;Scientists are now investigating the newly discovered giant in a transnational collaboration,&quot; explain the photographers. &quot;It could be the largest such structure nearest to us in the Universe.&quot;


You can see the rest of the winning images on the Royal Observatory site as well as coverage from the BBC, the Guardian, Colossal, and Universe Today.

                  <p>Birds of the World: The Art of Elizabeth Gould is a new book documenting the work of early 19th century naturalist artist Elizabeth Gould.
Artist and illustrator Elizabeth Gould is finally given the recognition she deserves in this gorgeous volume that includes hundreds of her stunning and scientifically precise illustrations of birds from nearly every continent.
For all of her short life, Elizabeth Gould&#x27;s artistic career was appreciated through the lens of her husband, ornithologist John Gould, with whom she embarked on a series of ambitious projects to document and illustrate the birds of the world. Elizabeth played a crucial role in her husband&#x27;s lavish publications, creating beautifully detailed and historically significant accurate illustrations of over six hundred birds -many of which were new to science. However, Elizabeth&#x27;s role was not always fully credited and, following her tragic death aged only thirty-seven, her efforts and talent were nearly forgotten.


Birds of the World: The Art of Elizabeth Gould is available for pre-order from Amazon or Bookshop.org and comes out on November 7. (via colossal)

                  <p>The first teaser trailer for season four of the Apple TV+ series For All Mankind takes the form of a recruitment video encouraging people to join the burgeoning workforce in space. It doesn&#x27;t give us much in the way of plot or character updates, but here&#x27;s the season synopsis (spoilers if you&#x27;re not caught up to the end of season three):
Rocketing into the new millennium in the eight years since Season 3, Happy Valley has rapidly expanded its footprint on Mars by turning former foes into partners. Now 2003, the focus of the space program has turned to the capture and mining of extremely valuable, mineral-rich asteroids that could change the future of both Earth and Mars. But simmering tensions between the residents of the now-sprawling international base threaten to undo everything they are working towards.


I have to admit my interest in the show waned a bit after the first season, but it&#x27;s still a pretty great show and I will be tuning in for season four on November 10. And is it just me or, if you tilt your head and squint, can you see For All Mankind as a prequel/origin story for The Expanse? (via gizmodo)

                  <p>This is pretty clever actually: Disney+ and ESPN+ will air a real-time, Toy Story-ified version of the Oct 1st Jacksonville Jaguars and Atlanta Falcons NFL game. From Deadline:
Using the NFL&#x27;s Next Gen Stats and on-field tracking data, every player and play will be presented in &quot;Andy&#x27;s Room,&quot; the familiar, brightly colored setting for the Toy Story franchise. The action will be virtually simultaneous with the main game telecast, with most plays recreated after an expected delay in the neighborhood of about 30 seconds. Woody, Buzz Lightyear and many other characters will be visible throughout, and a press release notes they will be &quot;participating from the sidelines and in other non-gameplay elements.&quot; Along with game action, the announcers, graphics, scoreboard, referees&#x27; penalty announcements, celebrations and other parts of the experience will all be rendered in a Toy Story-centric fashion.


I stopped watching the NFL years ago, but I might tune in to see how this works.

                  <p>Hello! I was talking to a friend about how git works today, and we got onto the
topic – where does git store your files? We know that it’s in your .git
directory, but where exactly in there are all the versions of your old files?
For example, this blog is in a git repository, and it contains a file called
content/post/2019-06-28-brag-doc.markdown. Where is that in my .git folder?
And where are the old versions of that file? Let’s investigate by writing some
very short Python programs.
git stores files in .git/objects
Every previous version of every file in your repository is in .git/objects.
For example, for this blog, .git/objects contains 2700 files.
$ find .git/objects/ -type f | wc -l
2761


note: .git/objects actually has more information than “every previous version
of every file in …</p>

I struggle to frame exactly what they are doing because Unity’s decision is so bizzarely resentful toward their huge developer base that trusted them. You can read this for context… I’ve done a lot of writing curating and covering tools, and showcasing alternatives to popular ones. I even have a collection on itch.io keeping track of things that are on that platform: https://itch.io/c/235488/cool-tools For myself, it is an imperative to always be aware of alternatives!

                  <p>Although ffconf has been running since 2009, sponsorship is always a process that you have to start from scratch. The event is organised by just Julie and myself, specifically we don&#x27;t have a dedicated sales person (perhaps we should?). This means keeping in touch with our sponsors and reaching out using a skill set that neither of us naturally possess.
I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a lot of smaller events like us that work similarly. So I write this to speak to the companies who would be great supporters and sponsors of our events, and I hope to explain to you (the companies and people who can help point your companies to us) what our events bring to the web community, and web business in general.</p>

                  <p>I really enjoyed this piece by Tom Vanderbilt on how time is kept, coordinated, calculated, and forecast. It&#x27;s full of interested tidbits throughout, like:
Care to gawk at one of the world&#x27;s last surviving original radium standards, a glass ampoule filled with 20.28 milligrams of radium chloride prepared by Marie Curie in 1913? NIST has it in the basement, encased in a steel bathtub, buried under lead bricks.


And:
For GPS to work, it needs ultra-exact timing: accuracy within fifteen meters requires precision on the order of fifty nanoseconds. The 5G networks powering our mobile phones demand ever more precise levels of cell-tower synchronization or calls get dropped.


And:
And as Mumford could have predicted, nowhere has time become so fetishized as in the financial sector, with the emergence over the past decade of algorithmic high-frequency trading. Donald MacKenzie, the author of Trading at the Speed of Light, estimated in 2019 that a trading program could receive market data and trigger an order in eighty-four nanoseconds, or eighty-four billionths of a second.


And:
All this makes F1 staggeringly accurate: it will gain or shed only one second every 100,000,000 years. Since the days when time was defined astronomically, the accuracy of the second is estimated to have increased by a magnitude of eight.


And:
&quot;A clock accurate to a second over the age of the cosmos,&quot; Patrick Gill, a physicist at the U.K.&#x27;s National Physical Laboratory, is quoted as saying in New Scientist, &quot;would allow tests of whether physical laws and constants have varied over the universe&#x27;s history.&quot;


And:
&quot;If you were to lift this clock up a centimeter of elevation,&quot; Hume told me, &quot;you would be able to discern a difference in the ticking rate.&quot; The reason is Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity: Time differs depending on where you are experiencing it.


And I could go on and on. If any or all of those tidbits is interesting to you, you should go ahead and read the whole thing.

                  <p>I love reading about speedrunning, specifically Super Mario Bros speedrunning, so this piece in Ars Technica about a new world record by Niftski is right up my alley. Here&#x27;s the run if you want to watch it:

Four particular things caught my eye about this run:
Niftski&#x27;s new record is 4m 54.631s, which is now faster than what was believed to be the theoretical limit for a human-played game.
It&#x27;s also extremely close to the fastest SMB game ever played done using tool-assisted speedrunning (where you basically play in super slow motion, so you can make all the very precise movements easily, a la The Flash). &quot;In the battle of man versus machine, Niftski is now just 0.35 seconds away from standing up, John Henry-style, against the standard of machine-made automation.&quot;



I always marvel at the level of dedication and ingenuity of the players working together (though competition) to lower the possible times through the tiniest of adjustments.



His heart rate tops out at 188bpm by the end of the game. I know he&#x27;s sitting at a desk, but that&#x27;s got to be of some cardiovascular advantage, right?

👏👏👏

As usual, SmokyMountains.com has published their best guess as to when the leaves will be changing in various parts of the country. At the end of September and beginning of October here in Vermont, it&#x27;ll start looking like this.

                  <p>A group of students from ETH Zurich and Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts recently set a record for the fastest 0-62mph time with their hand-built electric car: 0.956 seconds. The 309-lb car got up to 62mph in just 40.3 feet, which is ~10 feet shorter than the width of a basketball court. The old record was 1.46 seconds, which this car just absolutely obliterated. For reference, the Tesla Plaid&#x27;s 0-60 time is 1.99 seconds.
The video of their run is kind of amazing...the car is just so ludicrously quick that I started giggling when it leapt off the line.

                  <p>In React, we don&#x27;t update the DOM directly, we tell React what we want the DOM to look like, and React tackles the rest. But how exactly does it do this? In this tutorial, we&#x27;ll unpack exactly when and why React re-renders, and how we can use this information to optimize the performance of our React apps.</p>

                  <p>How should we structure components and other files in our React apps? I&#x27;ve iterated my way to a solution I&#x27;m really happy with. In this blog post, I&#x27;ll share how it works, what the tradeoffs are, and how I mitigate them.</p>

                  <p>For so many React devs, styled-components seems kinda magical. It isn&#x27;t at all clear how it uses traditional CSS features under-the-hood, and that lack of clarity can cause real problems when things go awry. In this post, we&#x27;ll learn exactly how styled-components works by building our own mini-version.</p>

                  <p>By and large, using the web is a visual experience. This is in terrible contrast to mobile apps, which interact with three of our human senses (sight, sound, and touch, through haptic feedback). I just released a library to make it easy to add sound to your React app, and I make the case that you should consider using it!</p>

                  <p>Love this recent JWST shot of the M51 spiral galaxy.
The graceful winding arms of the grand-design spiral galaxy M51 stretch across this image from the NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope. Unlike the menagerie of weird and wonderful spiral galaxies with ragged or disrupted spiral arms, grand-design spiral galaxies boast prominent, well-developed spiral arms like the ones showcased in this image. This galactic portrait was captured by Webb&#x27;s Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI).
In this image the reprocessed stellar light by dust grains and molecules in the medium of the galaxy illuminate a dramatic filamentary medium. Empty cavities and bright filaments alternate and give the impression of ripples propagating from the spiral arms. The yellow compact regions indicate the newly formed star clusters in the galaxy.

                  <p>About once a year, boat owners on Wisconsin&#x27;s Lake Chippewa gather to move a small floating island from blocking access under a bridge. It&#x27;s a simple application of Newtonian physics: the boats all just nose into the island, gun their motors, and slowly shove the island out of the way.
The floating clump of mud and plant material is technically a bog, not an island, but it&#x27;s hefty enough to support the growth of trees all the same. Looking at it, you could easily believe it was a fully-fledged island. That is... until it starts drifting around.
&quot;It&#x27;s one of the first things you look for when you come out here in the morning; where&#x27;s the bog?&quot; Denny Reyes, owner of The Landing in Chippewa, told Arizona News.
The problematic bog is actually one of many, but it&#x27;s one of the biggest and close to a bridge that can get blocked when it goes for a wander. In 2022, with the wind on their side, it took around 25 boats to budge the bog and collectively push it back out into the lake.

He. Skis. THROUGH THE MOUNTAIN. Also, if you can, pause it right after he jumps off the lift platform...the kid on the lift with his dad is like ( ﾟoﾟ).
No one has ever asked me this. No one ever asks people questions like this. &quot;People ask me...&quot; is a phrase writers use to create a sense of an ongoing story. It&#x27;s better than &quot;This is a cool video&quot;...you can only use that one so many times. ↩

                  <p>Cutting to the chase: text editors *and* tabs vs. spaces!  Ooooh!


I&#x27;ve had this thing called &quot;e&quot; for a while now.  It&#x27;s a stupid little 
script which serves to do a couple of things.  It starts my 
editor
with a given file, and it kicks it with the right arguments to make it 
disable line wrapping and to make the [TAB] key actually put in two 
spaces.


So, my dumb script would use &quot;-w -E -T 2&quot; most of the time, except when it 
was running on a Makefile, at which point it would skip those args.  
Simple enough, right?


pico is back?  Yes indeed, on Macs, as of 12.3, pico is in fact back.  To 
make sure I wasn&#x27;t imagining things, I tracked down a machine that hadn&#x27;t 
been upgraded yet and checked there.  Sure enough, it was in fact nano and 
not pico.


macOS 12.3 has nano as a symlink... pointing to pico!


At some point, I switched from literal tab characters in my source code to 
blobs of spaces, probably due to using that style at work and not hating 
it.  So, somewhere along the line I actually started depending on nano 
behavior without realizing it.


As for the lack of a feature in pico itself, it&#x27;s kind of strange, really.  
If you go digging into the source, they have this random.c with a function 
called tab which claims to &quot;simulate tab stop&quot; using spaces.  That said, I 
can&#x27;t find any place where it would be called with the magic values which 
would make it behave that way.


It wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if this switch is just more of Apple removing 
GPLed things from their OS - pico seems to use the Apache license.  They 
dumped bash for zsh (MIT license) at some point (Big Sur, I think), and 
now this?  Okay then.</p>

                  <p>Here&#x27;s a very old and stupid trick you could do with some filesystems in 
some situations back in the day... and might still be able to do in a 
few places today.


The problem is that while version X might eventually have an exploit, 
it&#x27;ll get removed and it&#x27;ll be replaced by version Y without that
particular hole.  By the time you get your hands on a tool to break into 
X, it&#x27;ll be gone.


What you&#x27;d do is create a hard link pointing at the file you wanted to 
preserve, storing it in a spot which was writable by your account.  
Then, say, /usr/bin/sudo (because that never has security 
issues...) gets replaced at some point with a new file and you get to 
keep the old version.  When you get the tool to pop it, off you go!


Of course, these days, it&#x27;s not quite so easy on the more modern systems 
you find.  Debian 11 here won&#x27;t let me do it - it&#x27;s EPERM city.  Rocky 8 
(so CentOS 8 and RHEL 8 too) also won&#x27;t do it.  They both have some gunk
in /usr/lib/sysctl.d to lock this down.  But, my old Slackware 14.2 
install of my workstation let me do it the last time I tried about 
a year ago.  How about that, huh?  I bet it&#x27;d still work if I dug out 
the old drives and booted them up.


Incidentally, this is the magic sauce: /proc/sys/fs/protected_hardlinks
Read the man page for proc(5) to learn more about it.

here it is,
the thread I read a long time ago.  It&#x27;s interesting to note that as far 
as I can tell, nothing actually changed upstream.  This left paranoid 
admins like me with no option but to use the (most excellent) Openwall 
patches to lock down this kind of stuff.  I used that on my machines at 
work which had non-staff users... just in case.


This whole situation is scary.

                  <p>Back in January, you might have seen my
post
about a very large BBS which seemed to solve for the problem of &quot;how do 
we host a bunch of users&quot; by having one physical box per user.  It might 
have been one physical box per *two* users, maybe, but it&#x27;s hard to say.


Now, keep in mind digital cameras weren&#x27;t easy to come by, so I have 
very few actual pictures.  I&#x27;ll have to do a lot of explaining to make 
up for the lack of detail and alternate angles.  Clearly, I had no 
notion of ever using these pictures to tell stories 25+ years later.


Some friends at a local company had some bandwidth to spare (a T1 to 
Alternet somewhere, as I recall), so they parked a Zoom modem on one of 
their boxes and plugged it into a phone line.  We got an identical model 
to avoid cross-brand issues (Zoom m…</p>

save them in case conditions change or other things happen and make me 
want to follow up on the topic.  In this case, I wrote something about 
offices before the whole COVID lockdown thing happened and people 
largely stopped going to offices every day.  With that in mind, let&#x27;s 
proceed.


However, tech companies decided to go past this at some point and 
brought about this whole notion of &quot;microkitchens&quot;.  This is where 
they&#x27;d put their branding on the coolers (instead of &quot;Coca-Cola&quot; or 
&quot;Pepsi&quot;) and would load it up with every kind of fizzy sugary liquid

                  <p>One of the fun things I used to do at a prior job was to dig through the 
raw data points which were collected from the *many* servers we had.  I 
could just pick an interesting-sounding metric and then would just ask 
the system to show me the top 10 or bottom 10 out of a population of 
thousands or more.


To get my feet wet with the whole &quot;investigations&quot; thing that we&#x27;d do, I 
started looking into this one day and chose one of the many temp sensors 
which were being logged by the servers.  I forget exactly which one it 
was, for there were many.  The CPUs logged it, the chassis logged it, 
the power supply logged it, and so on.  There were so many choices.


I went looking for a reason.  What could possibly explain this?  First 
off, it didn&#x27;t line up with any obvious pattern in the host names.  The 
hosts were named for whichever team owned them, followed by a sequence 
number that was bumped any time a new one was provisioned.  There was no 
signal to be found in that.


There was more, though.  You could also see a &quot;rack position&quot; in this 
data, and now it started getting interesting.  It seems that all of the 
really hot machines had a rack position of something low, like 04 or 05, 
and never anything higher than that.  In fact, when looking at a whole 
rack, it was always the lowest number of all of the positions that were 
being used.  Now this was worth chasing!


It&#x27;s good that I asked, since they told me something surprising: 
position 04 or 05 or whatever was the *bottom* of the rack.  Yes, 
somehow, the lowest machine in the rack was the hottest!  They found 
this interesting, too, and wound up digging into it.  Given that I was 
far away in a distant office, this was the best way for us to proceed.


The problem was that the bottommost server would have nothing below it 
but just open space until it got to the floor.  That space would not 
move air efficiently, and it obviously mattered.


This rolled out and my hot spots disappeared.  Fantastic!</p>

                  <p>Another day, another bit of local flavor, but this time it&#x27;s something I 
wish I didn&#x27;t have to write about.

wrote
about seeing a maintenance truck rolling down the Caltrain line in 
Mountain View.  It had a special attachment to let it stay on the rails.  
At no point did the arms come down for the crossing.  It managed to 
approach, then the people inside looked around and went through, and the 
arms never budged.  There were no flashing lights or bells.




caught fire.  A bunch of people were hurt.  More were shaken 
up.


I&#x27;m assuming their construction trucks don&#x27;t trigger the &quot;short the 
rails together to signal various things&quot; logic, either.  This would 
mean that crossing arms stay up... and I have to assume it also means 
the signals along the way stay green instead of going red.

We will presumably hear more about whatever the signals said, and 
whether the train went past a red signal or not.  I just have a bad 
feeling that they saw a green and kept on going.</p>

                  <p>Here&#x27;s a little bit of Silicon Valley local flavor for a change.  We 
have this freeway that runs from San Jose to San Francisco called US 
101, or around here, just &quot;101&quot;.  (Southern California has it too, but 
they call it &quot;the&quot; 101.  That&#x27;s how we detect invaders.)  Anyway, this 
thing is usually eight or more lanes up and down the peninsula, and it&#x27;s 
had a &quot;diamond&quot; or car pool lane on the #1 (innermost/&quot;fast&quot;) lane for 
many years.  You had to have a certain number of people in the car (or 
some other conditions met) during certain hours (AM and PM rush, 
weekdays), or you&#x27;d be in for a hefty ticket.


How does the system know what to charge you?  Well, you either have an 
old-style toll transponder that always bills you as a solo driver, or 
you have a new-style transponder with a 1/2/3+ switch that tells the 
road how to handle you.


Think about what this does to enforcement.  Now, instead of just &quot;is 
there a vehicle in the lane&quot;, &quot;is it the right time during a weekday&quot;, 
and &quot;how many people are in the car&quot;, now it&#x27;s also a matter of &quot;do they 
have their transponder set properly&quot;.


Check this out.

                  <p>I already told a
story
about how you can hose your machine by pointing the Linux kernel at a 
custom core dump handler and then have that handler fail to function.  
This&#x27;ll clog up the pipe (really), and then everything else will just 
stack up behind it.  Pretty soon, every crashing process will be stuck 
just the same.


Once upon a time, in a big company environment, someone decided that 
they wanted to provide a service to other things running on the same 
Linux box.  But, instead of either writing Yet Another Service (tm) 
that would go through release processes and all of that good stuff, they 
went for a different design entirely.


There are so many problems with this.  You have the issue of a &quot;server&quot; 
that appears out of thin air depending on who or what starts first on

                  <p>If a web site makes an RSS or Atom feed available, it&#x27;s not a bad idea 
to poll it from time to time.  Actually doing that poll like a good 
netizen (remember that concept?) takes a little attention to detail.


Given the reality of the situation, does it make sense to poll every 10 
seconds?  Probably not, right?  Someone set up something like that and 
left it running for a couple of months until I finally noticed it and 
dealt with it myself.


Given this, you can keep track of the &quot;Last-Modified&quot; header when you 
get a copy of the feed.  Then, you can turn around and use that same 
value in an &quot;If-Modified-Since&quot; header the next time you come to look 
for an update.  If nothing&#x27;s changed, the web server will notice it&#x27;s 
the same as what it already has, and it&#x27;ll send you a HTTP 304 co…</p>

                  <p>Here&#x27;s a concept: &quot;ssh to prod and edit directly on the machine&quot; is 
generally bad news.


I should point out that I didn&#x27;t know this person and had no idea how 
they would respond to such feedback - it might have been fine!  They 
might be a well-adjusted person who can take a request like that and not 
turn it around into a full-on nuclear attack.  But, I didn&#x27;t know either 
way.


At some point, I actually had a meeting with this developer for some 
other reason, and what happened was kind of amazing.  First thing, he 
brought it up and asked me about it.  I said something like, &quot;well, I 
didn&#x27;t want to get into it, but since you asked&quot;, and proceeded into 
something along the lines of &quot;obviously it would be best if you didn&#x27;t 
do that - sshing in and twiddling Python files on the actual production 
AWS instance of the service&quot;.


&quot;But... I suspect you are doing it for some reason?&quot;


My response was... I hope... reasonable: &quot;So as much as I would love to 
say &#x27;don&#x27;t do that!!!&#x27;, I&#x27;m not going to stand in the way of you 
literally doing your job.  So please proceed with care, and keep an eye 
open for some day when (first dumb thing) and (second dumb thing) aren&#x27;t 
problems any more and you need not do this any more.&quot;


It was either &quot;edit in prod&quot; or endure DAY LONG development cycles: make 
a change, wait 24 hours, come back tomorrow, and try it again.  That&#x27;s 
how broken it was.


The best part about this was that we had a totally reasonable 
conversation about it.  It&#x27;s the kind of thing which had become a rare 
commodity in those days at that place.


Would I expect someone else to go to that level of insanity every single 
time they just want to get their job done?  Absolutely not.

Editing files in prod to develop them?  That&#x27;s bad news.  Deliberately 
rigging tunnels to spoof a connection from prod?  That&#x27;s also bad news.  
Having to do them to get your job done?  You might be in the bad place.</p>

                  <p>Quite a while back, I wrote a post that basically went like this: if 
someone has a problem with someone else or something that person is 
doing, they&#x27;re going to find a way to get to &quot;no&quot;.  They will find some 
reason, some excuse, or some problem with it.  They&#x27;ll bring up a point 
and you&#x27;ll show that this is not in fact a thing.  They will then pivot 
again and again.


But, as I said, that was back then, and this time I&#x27;m talking about 
something else: when it happens in person with a coworker.  I had an 
experience like this a few years back, and figured I&#x27;d share how it goes 
for the sake of others who might not have encountered it yet, or who 
have and thought they were alone in this.

                  <p>This is a short one since it&#x27;s somewhere between a random bit of 
&quot;grab some popcorn&quot; amusement and a &quot;huh, that might be a problem some 
day&quot;.  In short, it looks like every Raspberry Pi filesystem installed 
from any given release image probably ends up with the same
UUID.


For instance, if you downloaded the &quot;lite&quot; version of Raspbian between 
roughly November 8th and January 28th, you probably got a file called 
2021-10-30-raspios-bullseye-armhf-lite.zip.  Inside, there&#x27;s an image, 
and the idea is that you dump that straight to your SD card, cram it in 
the Pi, and off you go.  The second partition on that image is an ext4 
filesystem which was created on some build machine somewhere.  The UUID 
on it never gets &quot;evolved&quot; to something else after the install.


You can see it inside the image itself here:


Or, if you actually installed a few of these things like I did over the 
past couple of months, you can just &#x27;tune2fs -l /dev/mmcblk0p2&#x27; and see 
the same value in there.


Don&#x27;t end up with a pile of SD cards on your desk and think &quot;I know, 
I&#x27;ll use the filesystem UUIDs to track which one goes where&quot;, in other 
words.


If it&#x27;s not breaking anything for you, it&#x27;s probably best to just let it 
be.  Untangling a boot mess on these weird little boxes is anything but 
fun.

Note: if you&#x27;re actually on a recent Raspberry Pi, odds are good that 
your /etc/fstab will be using *partition* UUIDs (PARTUUID&#x3D;...) and not 
those of the filesystem.  If in doubt, use blkid to see what&#x27;s what.</p>

thing.  If you haven&#x27;t heard of it yet, it&#x27;s apparently this thing that 
was trained on a whole mess of repositories and their code, and you can 
&quot;prompt&quot; it and it&#x27;ll spit out code that may or may not do what you 
want.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to know about licensing (BSD, GPL, MIT, that sort 
of thing), or plagiarism, or any of that other good stuff.


This is actually a story about somewhere I used to work, and someone who 
was on one of my teams back in the day.  One day, I heard that one of 
the people in a far-away office had created some kind of tool that would 
let you look at the status of different machines - that is, Linux boxes. 
I don&#x27;t remember the finer points of it or why this person even 
bothered, but they…</p>

                  <p>There are some interesting implications to the way that you have to 
handle references to other bits of code when you write a C++ header 
file.  There are things you can do which turn out to be suboptimal, and 
until or unless you work someplace with a coding style document or get 
some mentor who&#x27;s already been there, you&#x27;re likely to make some
mistakes.


Anyway, a common way to do this is to set up the outer class such that 
it has a pointer to the inner one.  You *could* have it just own it 
directly, but then that introduces problems.

  Bar bar_;



Of course, bar.h probably has its own dependencies which get #included, 
and so now you end up with this evil web of slow compiles.  It sucks.


What used to happen next is that someone would say, okay, let&#x27;s make it

                  <p>Yesterday, I
put forth
a bunch of API possibilities for the problem of needing to return a 
value but also indicating the lack of a value and being able to comment 
on why.  In it, the notion of a &quot;wrapper&quot; around a string was presented, 
such that it might look like &quot;Result&quot;, and those brackets 
started looking like a pain.  There was also the possibility of having 
something like &quot;ResultString&quot;, but didn&#x27;t that open the door to having a 
bunch of code duplication?


After this had existed for a while, the general happy feeling of having 
this stuff in place became infectious.  I wanted it to cover other 
things with it, too.  I wanted it to handle something a bit more 
complicated than a mere string, and so decided to try my hand at the 
template-wrangling metaprogramming cruft t…</p>

                  <p>If you agree with the notion that you need to be able to tell the 
difference between the absence of a value and a value itself, then this 
has some impacts on the code you write.  If you want to keep &#x27;em 
separated (so they can come out and play), then it gets you looking at 
your API designs in certain ways.


Imagine we&#x27;re talking about a helper function that is intended to be run 
inside a program that&#x27;s handling the access to a web page.  It&#x27;s 
probably a CGI program, but it could also be buried inside some much 
bigger thing, too.  This is all about C++ styles, but you can probably 
see slices of other languages in here, too.

I mentioned taking my old Mac Mini out of the OS X/macos ecosystem and

attempted to install a Javascript linter (and it tried to drag in 180+ 
node-related packages).

here.

which is serving rachelbythebay.com, which at the moment is a box called

do they ever really think about the implications of having hundreds of 
teeny little libraries, all moving independently?  This is how it 
manifests in the real world.


My relative inexperience with Debian systems means I&#x27;m constantly being 
delighted to discover that such and such has already been packaged up 
and is just an apt command away.  Things that I would have done by hand 
in the years up to this point now have someone else worrying about them.

Go and gRPC, apparently!


I found this while searching the web for &quot;1213486160&quot; to see how things 
have been going in the past few years.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s still biting 
people all over the place.  There are far too many posts asking people 
to upgrade their software, or restart things, or do any number of 
useless rubber-chicken-waving techniques which ultimately will 
accomplish nothing.

When you see a funny-looking number, figure out where it comes from.
That&#x27;s the only way to have any chance of understanding what&#x27;s actually

&quot;process infection&quot; story:

https://lwn.net/Articles/883547/):


If you do privileged execution of specific operations via IPC you get 
the guarantee that whatever is done, is done from a well-defined, 
pristine execution environment, without leaking context implicitly. The 
IPC message is the *full* vulnerable surface, and that&#x27;s as minimal as 
it can get. And that&#x27;s great.




Oh wow, thank you for mentioning that, unnamed reader!  I definitely 
read that post on LWN at some point in the past couple of days when the 
pkexec thing started going around.  It must have really worked its way 
into my head, and then eventually stirred up the memory of everything 
getting &quot;nicely infected&quot; at $OLD_JOB.

                  <p>I once worked at a place that had an interesting little problem stemming 
from the way they managed machines and some of the fun side-effects 
processes can have on each other.  This is back in the pre-systemd days 
of running services, such that things tended to be started or restarted 
by someone or something that itself ran as root.  That is, if you 
started something, it might inherit one or more things from your 
environment.  Likewise, if you ran something with an unusual 
environment, it might bestow those &quot;gifts&quot; onto anything it happened to 
touch.


After locking themselves out of machines too many times, people 
generally learned that after you mess with a glibc upgrade, you restart 
the sshd listener on port 22.  Of course, they also had to learn to not

in a post all by itself to give it a chance to &quot;sink in&quot; before I went 
and used it in an analogy.  First, I&#x27;ll just show the image and explain 
what you&#x27;re looking at here.




I do remember the description from the back: this is a picture of *part 
of* something that was called the Software Creations BBS.  It was a 
multi-line bulletin board system where you could dial up and send 
messages to people, upload and download files, and (presumably) play 
online games (&quot;doors&quot;) and anything else they cared to offer.

64 machines in a little space.  I have to assume 
they are at least 
286s (ATs, more or 
less), but it&#x27;s impossible to tell from just this picture.  They could 
have been 386s or even 486s by that point, but …</p>

                  <p>Okay, so yesterday I 
posted
a picture of an old multi-line bulletin board system which had 
apparently taken over an entire bedroom with dozens of computers.  I 
mentioned that I intended to come back to the topic to throw in my own 
two cents, and so here we go.


Or, were you someone who found it horrific and wished there was a 
simpler way?  Did you wonder if it would be possible to pack all of that 
into one or maybe two boxes, instead?  Did you want a way to negate all 
of that complexity while still providing the same level of service?


Now, things are different.  I look at that and just sigh at the lost 
opportunities.  The actual amount of work being done on behalf of any of 
the users who are connected is tiny.  If we ignore the fact that the
