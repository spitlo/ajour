In this article, we explore stacking contexts, and see how they can thwart our efforts to use z-index. We&#x27;ll also learn how to use this mechanism to our advantage.</p>

                  <p>Hello! Recently I’ve been thinking about putting my static sites on servers
that I run myself instead of using managed services like Netlify or GitHub
Pages.
Originally I thought that running my own servers would require a lot of
maintenance and be a huge pain, but I was chatting with Wesley about what kind
of maintainance their servers require, and
they convinced me that it might not be that bad.
So I decided to try out moving all my static sites to a $5/month server to see
what it was like.
Everything in here is pretty standard but I wanted to write down what I did

what choices other people make.

It exists – and is hundreds of years old. The hot water bottle could save a great deal of energy and money without sacrificing thermal comfort. Hot water bottles work both indoors and outdoors.

A hot water bottle is a sealable container filled with hot water, often enclosed in a textile cover, which is directly placed against a part of the body for thermal comfort.

                  <p>When I first learned about it, DNS didn’t seem like it should be THAT
complicated. Like, there are DNS records, they’re stored on a server, what’s
the big deal?
But with DNS, reading about how it works in a textbook doesn’t prepare you for
the sheer volume of different ways DNS can break your system in practice. It’s
not just caching problems!
So I asked people on Twitter for
example of DNS problems they’ve run into, especially DNS problems that didn’t
initially appear to be DNS problems. (the popular “it’s always DNS” meme)
I’m not going to discuss how to solve or avoid any of these problems in this
post, but I’ve linked to webpages discussing the problem where I could find
them.

In fact, I might have gone a bit too far, as I managed to stream full resolution video and even play games via WiFi. But see for yourself: Click the image to see the video on youtube.com. So, as usual, you have two alternatives to start here: Watch the video or read the article. If you are just curious and want to see what I did, definitely check out the video. If you want to understand exactly how it works and if you want to reproduce it or find tricks for your own projects, go for the article and the linked code. In any case, if you have not seen the previous article and/or video on the cartridge itself, you should start there.</p>

                  <p>Here’s a very quick “how to” post on how to find your domain’s authoritative
nameserver.
I’m writing this because if you made a DNS update and it didn’t work, there are 2 options:
Your authoritative nameserver doesn’t have the correct record
Your authoritative nameserver does have the correct record, but an old record is cached and you need to wait for the cache to expire
To be able to tell which one is happening (do you need to make a change, or do
you just need to wait?), you need to be able to find your domain’s
authoritative nameserver and query it to see what records it has.
But when I looked up “how to find a domain’s authoritative nameserver” to see
what advice was out there, I found a lot of different methods being mentioned,

                  <p>One of the things that makes DNS difficult to understand is that it’s
decentralized. There are thousands (maybe hundreds of thousands? I don’t know!) of authoritative nameservers, and at least
10 million resolvers.
And they’re running lots of different software! All these different servers
running software means that there’s a lot of inconsistency in how DNS works,
which can cause all kinds of frustrating problems.
But instead of talking about the problems, I’m interested in figuring out –
why is it a good thing that DNS is decentralized?
why is it good that DNS is decentralized?
One reason is scalability – the decentralized design of DNS makes it
easier to scale and more resilient to failures. I find it really amazing that
DNS is still scaling well even though it’s almost 40 years old. Th…</p>

                  <p>I guess I&#x27;ve turned into a collector of numbers that break things 
sometimes.  Here&#x27;s another one I just heard about, and it&#x27;s directly 
related to what just happened with the calendar.


The last value for last year is December 31, 2021 at 23:59, and in this 
format it becomes 2112312359.  That just fits into a signed 32 bit 
number (which tops out at 2147483647).


So, if you&#x27;re using Microsoft Exchange and stopped getting your mail in 
the past couple of hours, this is why!

Really!  No joke!

Happy 2022, everyone.</p>

                  <p>If you&#x27;ve ever tried to animate a gradient, you&#x27;ve been met with a harsh reality—it isn&#x27;t possible. At least, it wasn&#x27;t! In this tutorial, we&#x27;ll leverage bleeding-edge browser features to animate ANY CSS property, including background gradients, using CSS Houdini, CSS variables, and React.</p>

                  <p>Well, it&#x27;s 2022 and everything is turning out exactly as I predicted back when I was 7. Self-driving cars, space stations, the internet.  Nailed it.
Favorite TV show of 2021 was Only Murders in the Building.  
Favorite game of 2021 was Loop Heroes. 
Favorite book of 2021 was Einstein&#x27;s Fridge.
Favorite rediscovered joy of 2021 was reading physical books.
Favorite movie of 2021 was Dune.
Favorite time waster of 2021 was watching physics videos on YouTube.
Least favorite movie of 2021 was anything with f**king superheroes.
Favorite pandemic of 2021 was Covid-19 (three years running).
See you in an exciting 2022 where everyone will be nice and respectful and personal agendas are put aside for the greater good and we all come together and save the planet. 
Either that or a horrific dystopian post-apocalyptic world where we hunt each other for food.
2022 could go either way.</p>

                  <p>As my year in reading goes, I&#x27;ve certainly read less books, but I&#x27;ve not spent less time reading. It&#x27;s just some books take me longer than others. For example, I read Call of the Wild, an 80(ish) page book in 4 weeks and then I read a 400 page book in 4 days… so it&#x27;s really swings and roundabouts.
I recorded 21 books on my Kindle this year, but actually one of them was read aloud to the kids (Which I do still count) but another one was all of 19 pages… which, I think really doesn&#x27;t count (it was Home: Habitat, Range, Niche, Territory by Martha Wells). So… 20 books then.
This post is mostly data driven (from my own web site&#x27;s data) to give me a sense of the quality of the books I&#x27;ve read, otherwise individual reviews are all linked in this post or available on my books page.</p>

                  <p>It’s the end of the year again! This was my second full year working for myself
on wizard zines.
Here are some thoughts about what I’m working towards, a bunch of things I made
this year, and a few ideas and questions about 2022.
made some progress on a “mission statement”
I think the two hardest things about working for myself are working alone and
having to decide what to do.
This year I spent some time trying to figure out what I’m doing with wizard
zines. This is hard for me because I work in a pretty intuitive way – I have
some feelings about what’s important, and even though following my feelings
usually turns out well, I can’t always explain what I’m trying to do.
Here are some thoughts about what I’m trying to do:

News
It is snowing, and we are cocooning. Our little woodstove is working hard. This month, we finally decided to release a paperback version of Busy Doing Nothing.
In our last update log, we mentioned that we were trying to grow Lion&#x27;s Mane mushroom, and we are happy to report that it was a success! It grew beautifully. Rek was so excited about the mushroom that they decided to draw some this month, this series focuses on varieties that grow on Vancouver Island.
In other news, we had an interview with the founder of Sourcehut, read it here. Also, our good friend Alderwick make us a very cool gift(YouTube).
Pino book club
We&#x27;re reading Fantômes: Issue 1, with work by 18 talented artists, put together by Lizbeth. It is a eerie, and gorgeous zine, we strongly recommend the Mike Wolf version.
Pino&#x27;s location: 48° 42.230&#x27;N, 123° 36.900&#x27;W

                  <p>~ This post is my epic roundup of recommendations for 202x! ~ When we talk about games, especially the indie game space, most of the games we suggest are ones with lots of critical acclaim, playtime, and that demand plenty of involvement. Playing a game these days feels like as much of a financial investment as it becomes a life investment. I find myself drawn more and more to spelunking itch.io for tiny hidden gems… getting lost while diving into all the developer pages filled with all these odd little works. Browsing itch or GameJolt has become almost as rewarding...</p>

                  <p>Lovely but I found the language almost too distracting.
Only right at the end of the book did I consider that maybe I really wasn&#x27;t the right audience for the story - as it seemed to smack of &quot;millennium type problems&quot;. Using air quotes in my description because I&#x27;m fairly sure this is a patronising statement I&#x27;m making!
The Dex character feels discontent with their achievements and is struggling to find fulfilling meaning. Their work has meaning to others but they&#x27;re left feeling empty. Obviously it&#x27;s an impossible measure as life trondles forward and achievements change with time.
For me it was only really when Dex meets the Robot (whose name I&#x27;ve already forgotten) when the book became more engaging. It was like the Dex character could be challenged and some real depth was offered (for better or worse for Dex&#x27;s personality).
But what I did struggle with was the language and the odd shoehorning of gender pronouns. Dex is neither &quot;he&quot; or &quot;she&quot;, so Chamber&#x27;s settles with using the &quot;they&quot; pronoun. This led to my own confusion regularly thinking the lines I was reading was referring to Dex and another character that was in the scene.
The sore-thumb moment is when Dex asks, interestingly, what pronoun the Robot uses, and the Robot responds with &quot;it&quot; and it refers to itself as an object. Dex replies with (something like) they are the same, and their pronoun is &quot;they&quot;. This seemed like a potentially interesting exchange between the Robot and Dex about the subject of how one refers to oneself and how they identify, but it doesn&#x27;t happen. It just has that exchange, and then the story returns to what they were doing and carries on. It felt jarring and like Chamber&#x27;s wanted to discuss this topic, but instead shoe horned it in.
I do also suspect that my trouble with the language is a me-thing and probably with practice it won&#x27;t cause me as much (or any) confusion, but for now, and this book, it definitely affected how I enjoyed the story.</p>

                  <p>That didn&#x27;t take long to fix and rebuild. I don&#x27;t know what is taking the city of Rome so long.

Start to finish, it took just over a year. I blame Limited Run Games.</p>

And then disaster stuck while moving it.

Most of the debris is still assembled large chucks, so it shouldn&#x27;t take long to fix.  I&#x27;m sure this happened to the real coliseum.</p>

                  <p>Several years back, I was doing my thing in a corporate environment, 
working on a project with some friends.  By virtue of being in a very 
large company, we had quite the assortment of libraries which could be 
brought in to do stuff.  Given that we had a &quot;would be nice&quot; item on our 
feature list that involved doing something with the filesystem, I went 
looking for a matching feature, and it turned into a security dumpster 
fire.  Here&#x27;s what happened.


When you&#x27;re in that situation, you can&#x27;t just mkdir() the final path.  
It won&#x27;t work.  You have to start from the top and work your way down.  
The ones which already exist will probably fail with -EEXIST, so 
sometimes it makes more sense to look at what&#x27;s there, work your way 
down, and then start the mkdir calls when you find that p…</p>

                  <p>Holiday repost!
Clayton and I did this back in Dec of 2004.  Interesting how much hasn&#x27;t changed. I&#x27;d have more &quot;male&quot; spouses now, something about loot crates and IAP, kissing up to steamers, and maybe change the last verse to be more &quot;indie&quot;, but its shockingly accurate years later.
The Twelve Days of Crunch Time
A poem by Gilbert and Kauzlaric
On the twelfth day of crunch time,
My project gave to me...

Twelve cents in royalties,

Eleven kiss-ass previews,

Ten nerdy testers,

Nine patent lawsuits,

Eight unplanned for features,

Seven frames a second,

Six angry spouses,

Five focus groups!

Four unstable hacks,

Three days without sleep,

Two surly artists,

and a crappy publishing deal.</p>

                  <p>I totally failed to guess the killer!
Poirot was staple TV viewing when I was a teenage so the image of the character is burned well into my consciousness (thank you David Suchet) - so reading an Agatha Christie book tends to come with very easy imagination and even accents for characters.
The story is well built, told in a way that makes me think I should have been able to deduce the killer myself (and something I&#x27;ve always wondered about murder mystery stories) and does a good job of flipping my expectations on its head!
Solid stuff.</p>

                  <p>I’ve been wanting to do another post talking about indie games, analyzing game design, and showcasing good examples from the indie space but… I’m struggling a lot with being afraid of unintentionally platforming an abuser. I know saying that out loud sounds irrational, maybe. It’s been hard finding love for a space that I feel like happily decided people like me are a justifiable loss if it means making snarky Twitter Takes about what they’re going through… or just benefiting from indifference. I don’t know anymore… I don’t want to rant. I want to talk about game design. It’s hard...</p>

and log4j somewhere in their lives are having a miserable time.  I 
figured I&#x27;d re-tell a story about terrible things done by way of a bunch 
of feature-rich libraries and dubious interconnections.  I&#x27;ve mentioned 
this in passing before, but this time I&#x27;ve tried to be much more 
specific about how it works.


Part 1: the flags.



DEFINE_bool(enable_foo, false, &quot;Enable the foo feature&quot;);
 
...
 
void my_func() {
  if (FLAGS_enable_foo) {
    do_something();
  }
}




DECLARE_bool(enable_foo);
 
...
 
void other_func() {
  // Turns out we need foo enabled to do our stuff.
  FLAGS_enable_foo &#x3D; true;
  // ...
}




int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  InitCompany(argc, argv);  // populates FLAGS_ of all kinds
  // ...
}

                  <p>It took a while, but I finally managed to create my own Game Boy cartridge. With WiFi! At this point, it can only demo a simple telnet-style communication and access Wikipedia articles, but I am confident that I will showcase more in the future. For now, the interesting and surprisingly tricky part is how the thing works at all. Click the image to see the video on youtube.com. If you just want to see the cartridge in action or want to get into all the details, I highly recommend to watch the video first as it goes through the difficulties and their respective solutions. In contrast, this article here is less visual in its explanations and mostly documents the device in detail, so unless you are already familiar with the parallel memory interface of the Game Boy, you might want to start with the overview from the video.</p>

                  <p>Hello! I’ve been thinking about how to explain DNS a bunch in the last year.
I like to learn in a very hands-on way. And so when I write a zine, I often
close the zine by saying something like “… and the best way to learn more
about this is to play around and experiment!“.
So I built a site where you can do experiments with DNS called Mess With DNS. It has examples of experiments you can try, and
you’ve very encouraged to come up with your own experiments.
In this post I’ll talk about why I made this, how it works, and give you
probably more details than you want to know about how I built it (design, testing,
security, writing an authoritative nameserver, live streaming updates, etc)

Here’s a GIF screencast of what it looks like to use it:

Younger Remy would have never believed that I could read a book this length. It was simple something that was impossible. For me, my Kindle changed reading for me and opened the door to the world of literature.</p>

                  <p>Took a while to warm to the characters, but worth it in the end.The story follows an exceptionally grumpy old lady, very much a stereotypical old person who doesn&#x27;t trust anyone and exists almost just for themselves.We also meet her grandson who is equally useless in his own ways. These two characters together made it rather difficult to want to keep reading their story, but I&#x27;m glad I did persevere.Although the story is a little cliche, around four fifths the way through the book, it does a pretty good job to win me over to the main characters and I want to see them happy by the end of the story.Probably a little bit too long, but worth it for the payoff at the end.</p>

                  <p>CSS is about styling boxes. In fact, the whole web is made of boxes, from the browser viewport to elements on a page. But every once in a while a new feature comes along that makes us rethink our design approach.
Round displays, for example, make it fun to play with circular clip areas. Mobile screen notches and virtual keyboards offer challenges to best organize content that stays clear of them. And dual screen or foldable devices make us rethink how to best use available space in a number of different device postures.
Sketches of a round display, a common rectangular mobile display, and a device with a foldable display.

I feel like the term &quot;DNS propagation&quot; is misleading, like you&#x27;re not actually waiting for DNS records to &quot;propagate&quot;, you&#x27;re waiting for cached records to expire
— 🔎Julia Evans🔍 (@b0rk) December 5, 2021
 
and I want to talk about it a little more. This came up because I was showing a
friend a demo of how DNS caching works last week, and he realized that what was
happening in the demo didn’t line up with his mental model of how DNS worked.
He immediately brought this up and adjusted his mental model (“oh, DNS records are
pulled, not pushed!“). But this it got me thinking – why did my very
smart and experienced friend have an inaccurate mental model for how DNS works
in the first place?
First – I’m very tired of posts that complain about how people are “w…</p>

                  <p>Hello! I talked to a couple of friends recently who mentioned they wished they knew
how to use dig to make DNS queries, so here’s a quick blog post about it.
When I first started using dig I found it a bit intimidating – there are so
many options! I’m going to leave out most of dig’s options in this post and just
talk about the ones I actually use.
Also I learned recently that you can set up a .digrc configuration file to make its output
easier to read and it makes it SO MUCH nicer to use.
I also drew a zine page about dig a few years ago, but I wanted to write this post to include a bit more information.
2 types of dig arguments: query and formatting
There are 2 main types of arguments you can pass to dig:
arguments that tell dig what DNS query to make

                  <p>Hello, world!  A couple of days ago, I noticed someone remarking on a 
line from an older post of mine that had been making the rounds.  In it, 
I say something about adding a number to &quot;my list of magic numbers&quot;.  
That person wanted to see that list.


And so, I have put together this list of everything I can think of at 
the moment, along with a whole bunch of commentary that should be able 
to send you on dozens of romps through Wikipedia.  Hopefully this will 
both satisfy the request for &quot;the list&quot; and provide a lot of amusement 
on a day which normally is lacking in content.


Be safe out there, and enjoy.

                  <p>I&#x27;ve told some stories about what happens when you end up at a company 
that builds nothing and instead rents everything from some vendor.  
Given that, it&#x27;s only fair that I describe something bad that can 
happen at a company which is known for building stuff.


The trouble is that sometimes these companies will hire someone who&#x27;s 
known for doing X... and *only* X.  They&#x27;re a builder, all right, as 
long as you want them to build X.  Perhaps they have been building X at 
some other company, and now your company has hired them to come and do 
that same job over here instead.


There&#x27;s also the possibility that the prestige of having this person 
working at the company is what they&#x27;re actually cultivating, and 
management wants to make this person happy by letting them work on their 
pet project, even if the pet project itself is not doing anything 
positive.

actually belongs in 
production.  In one outcome, it&#x27;s brilliantly executed and things grow.  
But, this is about the downsides, and in that scenario, it&#x27;s a stinking 
pile of garbage and needs to be thrown out, but it gets forced in, 
anyway.


If this project is being pushed for political reasons, then it should 
not come as a surprise that when it finally does ship to production,
it causes outages and generally fails to deliver on its promises.  It&#x27;s 
actually worse than just leaving things the way they had been before any 
of this stuff showed up.


Just imagine what companies would look like if their hiring processes 
filtered out this kind of charlatan instead of looking for whether they 
could do some dumb coding card trick in a 45 minute interview block.
I think they&#x27;d look very different, and a whole bunch of people would 
have to find another industry to prey upon.</p>

November was a very rainy month in Victoria, a perfect time for experiments in the galley. We are growing Lion&#x27;s Mane mushrooms currently (a first for us), and we are continuing to lacto-ferment vegetables like kohlrabi, turnips, daikon, cauliflower and red onion. To learn how to do it, see our guide to lactofermentation.
