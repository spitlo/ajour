You will know Him when you see Him,

Multitudinous is Synergy Greg!

His handshake grinds the bones of the world,

Beneficent is Synergy Greg!

His lungs are mighty bellows,

Go Team! Get! Shit! Done!
He will wait by the sidelines,
  
Any day now.
His minions are manifold and wise,

Synergy Greg has all the Secrets of Business,

Synergy Greg is self-made,
  
Benevolent is Greg!

Forgiving is Greg!

Diverse is Greg!

Just keep the brown,

Busy is Greg!

Down-To-Earth is Greg,
  
Why is His food taking so long?
  
And He has rostered you for Saturday,
  
And why do they hate the office?
  
And it&#x27;s an unpaid internship,
  
And you aren&#x27;t a team player,
  
And no one wants to work anymore,
  
And He&#x27;s sad to announce layoffs,
  
And employees used to be loyal,
  
And nurses should not strike,
  
And medical patents don&#x27;t pay for themselves,
  
And you can&#x27;t prove it&#x27;s carcinogenic,
  
And the village is in the way,
  
And He wants you to lift those bricks with your back,

He will burn through ten imported workers in one great pull,

And above all,

Great is Synergy Greg!

Is he gone?

He&#x27;s gone?
Between the two of us,


I&#x27;d like to apologize to any readers called Greg.</p>

                  <p>As part of the effort to incorporate the Negro Leagues into MLB history, MLB held a pair of games at Birmingham, Alabama‚Äôs Rickwood Field, ‚Äúthe oldest professional ballpark in the United States and former home of the Birmingham Black Barons of the Negro Leagues‚Äù. During the pregame show Fox Sports invited Reggie Jackson, who played on a minor league team at the ballpark, to offer his perspective on the event. (Content note: Jackson says the n-word twice during his remarks.)

About halfway through this clip (the 4:35 mark), Alex Rodriguez asks him a softball question designed to elicit some fond memories about baseball and some gauzy reflections on the impact of the Negro Leagues:
How emotional is it for you to come back to a [place] that you played with one of the greatest teams around?

                  <p>Ta-Nehisi Coates is coming out with a new book this fall (Oct 1, 2024) called The Message and it sounds really interesting:
Ta-Nehisi Coates originally set out to write a book about writing, in the tradition of Orwell‚Äôs classic ‚ÄúPolitics and the English Language,‚Äù but found himself grappling with deeper questions about how our stories ‚Äî our reporting and imaginative narratives and mythmaking ‚Äî expose and distort our realities.
In the first of the book‚Äôs three intertwining essays, Coates, on his first trip to Africa, finds himself in two places at once: in Dakar, a modern city in Senegal, and in a mythic kingdom in his mind. Then he takes readers along with him to Columbia, South Carolina, where he reports on his own book‚Äôs banning, but also explores the larger backlash to the nation‚Äôs rece‚Ä¶</p>

                  <p>After four years, Roxane Gay signs off from her Work Friend column.
I am not an idealist or much of an optimist, but being your Work Friend pushed me in that direction. I want, too. I want a world where we can all live our best professional lives. I want everyone to make a living wage and have excellent health care and the means to retire at a reasonable age. I want all of us to want this very simple thing for one another.
And, frankly, a fulfilling and equitable professional life should not be the stuff of utopia. This should be our reality. It is astonishing to see how many people are so deeply unhappy at work, so trapped by circumstances beyond their control, so vulnerable to toxic workplaces and toxic cultural expectations around work. As I read your letters I mostly thought: ‚ÄúIt shouldn‚Äôt be this way. It shouldn‚Äôt be this hard.‚Äù
We shouldn‚Äôt have to suffer or work several jobs or tolerate intolerable conditions just to eke out a living, but a great many of us do just that. We feel trapped and helpless and sometimes desperate. We tolerate the intolerable because there is no choice. We ask questions for which we already know the answers because change is terrifying and we can‚Äôt really afford to risk the loss of income when rent is due and health insurance is tied to employment and someday we will have to stop working and will still have financial obligations.

                  <p>In 1930, Iowa artist Grant Wood painted American Gothic. The models he used for the painting were his sister Nan Wood Graham and his dentist, Byron McKeeby. Here they are next to the painting:

Wood made the painting after spotting a small house in Eldon, Iowa:

                  <p>The CSS WG resolved to add if() to CSS, but that won‚Äôt be in browsers for a while.
What are our options in the meantime?
A couple days ago, I posted about the recent CSS WG resolution to add an if() function to CSS.
Great as it may be, this is still a long way off, two years if everything goes super smoothly, more if not.
So what can you do when you need conditionals right now?
You may be pleased to find that you‚Äôre not completely out of luck.
There is a series of brilliant, horrible hacks that enable you to expose the kinds of higher level custom properties that conditionals typically enable.
Using hacks in production?!
The instinctive reaction many developers have when seeing hacks like these is ‚ÄúNice hack, but can‚Äôt possibly ever use this in production‚Äù.
This sounds reasonable on the su‚Ä¶</p>

Some of the intros I particularly enjoyed were Scott Joplin‚Äôs The Entertainer, Nina Simone‚Äôs My Baby Just Cares For Me, Let It Be by The Beatles, Don‚Äôt Stop Believin‚Äô by Journey, Children by Robert Miles, Clocks by Coldplay, A Thousand Miles by Vanessa Carlton, and Breathe Me by Sia. a song I still cannot listen to without tearing up because of the series finale of Six Feet Under.

‚ÄúEffortless‚Äù‚Ä¶ is a myth.
I mean it.
I say that as someone who has heard that word a lot. ‚ÄúEffortless.‚Äù
People would say my play was effortless. Most of the time, they meant it as a compliment‚Ä¶ But it used to frustrate me when they would say, ‚ÄúHe barely broke a sweat!‚Äù
Or ‚ÄúIs he even trying?‚Äù
The truth is, I had to work very hard‚Ä¶ to make it look easy.
I spent years whining‚Ä¶ swearing‚Ä¶ throwing my racket‚Ä¶ before I learned to keep my cool.

                  <p>Over at Beautiful Public Data, Jon Keegan shares some details about two huge collections of aerial photos of glaciers.


As scientists study the effects of global warming, one of the most visible and alarming indicators is the rapid shrinking of glaciers. Government scientists have been documenting the size, shape, and movement of glaciers since the 1950s employing techniques ranging from direct field observations to aerial photography.
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) has one of the largest collections of aerial glacier photographs. Over 40 years, the USGS‚Äô North American Glacier Aerial Photography (NAGAP) project captured thousands of striking high-resolution photos of glaciers and their surroundings.
From 1960 to 1983, self-taught glaciologist Austin Post used a 63-pound World War II-era Fairchild K-17 aerial reconnaissance camera to shoot over 100,000 glacier photos in the western US and Alaska. One of the bush pilots Post teamed up with was William R. Fairchild, who flew a Beech 18 twin engine airplane equipped with five K-17 cameras-one mounted on the nose, two in the belly of the plane, and one on each side.

Gaggan, in Bangkok, was named not just the ninth-best restaurant in the world but the single best restaurant in Asia. The chef, Gaggan Anand, greets diners at his 14-seat table facing the kitchen with ‚ÄúWelcome to my ‚Ä¶‚Äù completing the sentence with a term, meaning a chaotic situation, that will not be appearing in The New York Times.

I myself have formal training as a data scientist, going so far as to dominate a competitive machine learning event at one of Australia&#x27;s top universities and writing a Master&#x27;s thesis where I wrote all my own libraries from scratch in MATLAB. I&#x27;m not God&#x27;s gift to the field, but I am clearly better than most of my competition - that is, practitioners like myself who haven&#x27;t put in the reps to build their own C libraries in a cave with scraps, but can read textbooks, implement known solutions in ‚Ä¶</p>

                  <p>Using the official instructions and bricks from their own collection, a father &amp; son team built a colorful DIY version of Lego‚Äôs massive Millennium Falcon (7541 pieces, $830 MSRP, kitty for scale).
I love this ‚Äî much better than that dingy gray. I know it‚Äôs not quite the same, but the colorful Falcon harkens back to when Lego was more about throwing together whatever kaleidoscopic Franken-creations you could from your pile of bricks instead of completing just-so kits. (via @migurski)

                  <p>Wallace &amp; Gromit are returning for a feature-length film later this year ‚Äî and so is Feathers McGraw, the scofflaw penguin that made off with the wrong trousers in, um, The Wrong Trousers. Here‚Äôs the premise of Vengeance Most Fowl:
In this next installment, Gromit‚Äôs concern that Wallace is becoming too dependent on his inventions proves justified, when Wallace invents a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù gnome that seems to develop a mind of its own. When it emerges that a vengeful figure from the past might be masterminding things, it falls to Gromit to battle sinister forces and save his master ‚Ä¶ or Wallace may never be able to invent again!


Timely! Vengeance Most Fowl will debut on BBC in the UK in late December and at some later date on Netflix in the US and elsewhere.

                  <p>A 4K restoration of Akira Kurosawa‚Äôs epic Seven Samurai is heading to theaters this summer. The film screened at Cannes in May and screenings in the US start in July:
Janus will open the restoration on Friday, July 5 in New York at Film Forum after which a Los Angeles premiere will take place at the American Cinematheque‚Äôs Egyptian Theatre on Sunday, July 7. The film will open wide on Friday, July 12 in Los Angeles at Laemmle Royal.


Here‚Äôs the official poster for the restoration:

On a personal note, I‚Äôm pretty disheartened there‚Äôs a 99% chance this won‚Äôt be playing anywhere near me in Vermont. Run Lola Run was rereleased in theaters last week and I couldn‚Äôt find it anywhere within a reasonable drive. And the nearest IMAX is 2h15m away. I‚Äôm thankful that I can get all sorts of culture pumped into my house at gigabit speeds, but per contemporary wisdom, ‚Äúwe‚Äôve got Seven Samurai‚Äôs 4K restoration at home‚Äù is just not the same.

                  <p>It‚Äôs only the 9,000th time I‚Äôve heard this perfect song, but for whatever reason today was the day I looked it up. (Apologies to everyone who already knows.) Per Wikipedia:
In Scottish English, haver (from the Scots havers (oats)) means ‚Äúto maunder; to talk foolishly; to chatter,‚Äù as heard in the song ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Gonna Be (500 Miles)‚Äù by The Proclaimers


This song rules so much. It came on the other day while my daughter and I were goofing around ‚Äî sorry, while we were havering (?) ‚Äî and it was such a joy to watch her get into it.

                  <p>Somehow, I didn‚Äôt know that until quite recently, tennis balls were white instead of yellow (Wimbledon used white balls until 1985). Here‚Äôs a British Path√© film from 1961 that shows how tennis balls were made, along with Wimbledon ball boy training:

I also didn‚Äôt know that many people think tennis balls are green when they are actually a color called ‚Äúoptic yellow‚Äù. Oh and that David Attenborough had a hand in the switch from white to yellow.
The change in color happened due to the demands of television transmissions. In 1972 television was already in color all over the world (although in Spain it was not generalized until five or six years later). At the end of the 1960s, the person in charge of the BBC broadcasts (which, of course, was in charge of Wimbledon) was the renowned documentary filmmaker David Attenborough. And he noticed that the visibility of the traditional white ball was not perfect, especially if it approached the lines of the rectangle of play.
In that year of 1972, tennis was in full growth: the professional and amateur circuits had unified and women‚Äôs professional tennis was also growing. Tennis was becoming a great world spectacle and in this context television was fundamental. The International Tennis Federation, in charge of the rules, commissioned a study which showed that the yellow ball was more visible and therefore easier for viewers to follow. The courts, moreover, began to be multicolored once the use of synthetic materials in official tournaments was approved.

                  <p>The completion of the US transcontinental railroad in 1869 in Utah was also the birthplace of the newsflash. The news was delivered via telegraph through a clever scheme: the famous golden spike and a silver hammer were each wired to the telegraph so that when hammer struck nail, the circuit completed and the news raced out along telegraph wires to the rest of the nation.1

Where were you when you heard the news of the completion of the transcontinental railroad?

At least, that was the plan. It is said the hammer swingers missed the spike and so the telegraph operator had to message ‚ÄúDONE‚Äù instead.‚Ü©

                  <p>Kurzgesagt attempts to answer the question (from the perspective of physics): Do we have free will? Here‚Äôs the deterministic perspective (from the show notes):
Now imagine that if right after the Big Bang, a supersmart supercomputer looked at every single particle in the universe and noted all their properties. Just by applying the deterministic laws of physics, it should be able to predict what all the particles in existence would be doing until the end of time.
But if you are made of particles and it‚Äôs technically possible to calculate what particles will do forever, then you never decided anything. Your past, present and future were already predetermined and decided at the Big Bang. This would mean there is a kind of fate and you are not free to decide anything.

                  <p>YouTuber Paralogical downloaded data from over 5 billion chess games to find the rarest move in chess. Slight spoiler: there are many possible moves that weren‚Äôt played in any of the games analyzed. The data and analysis programs used are available on Github:
This is a lil‚Äô code to analyze chess .pgn files, with the goal of finding the ‚Äúrarest‚Äù move in chess.
That is, the rarest move notation (standard algebraic notation) given a large number of input games (e.g. every rated game from lichess) in pgn format.
However, since there are many moves that never happen, this is moreso counting and categorizing moves of various types rather than finding one specific rare move.

                  <p>NPR recently welcomed Chaka Khan into the office for a Tiny Desk Concert. 
When the ‚ÄúQueen of Funk,‚Äù Chaka Khan, began to sing her hit ‚ÄúSweet Thing‚Äù at the Tiny Desk, she seemed surprised at how the audience enthusiastically joined in. It‚Äôs just one example of how ingrained her work is in the fabric of music history. Since she emerged in the 1970s with the funk band Rufus, Khan has crafted a legacy that includes 22 albums, 10 Grammys, forays into jazz and theater and collaborations with Prince, Stevie Wonder, Joni Mitchell and Quincy Jones. Her 50 years in the music industry recently culminated in a long overdue 2023 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.


This was great right from the jump‚Ä¶one of my favorite Tiny Desks for sure.

                  <p>Today&#x27;s links An end to the climate emergency is in our grasp: We mustn&#x27;t let capitalism snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2004, 2009, 2014, 2019, 2023 Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I&#x27;ve been. Latest books: You keep readin&#x27; em, I&#x27;ll keep writin&#x27; &#x27;em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I&#x27;ll keep writin&#x27; &#x27;em. Colophon: All the rest. An end to the climate emergency is in our grasp (permalink) The problem with good news in the real world is that it&#x27;s messy. Neat happy endings are for novels, not the real world, and that goes double for the climate emergency. But even though good climate news is complicated and nuanced, that doesn&#x27;t mean it shouldn&#x27;t buoy our spirits and fill our hearts with hope. ‚Ä¶</p>

                  <p>Over the past few weeks, I&#x27;ve been experimenting with painting in watercolours using my AxiDraw plotter. Watercolour is a medium I enjoy painting in (by hand) as a personal hobby, kind of separate from my public art making, so it‚Äôs been interesting to combine it with code. I‚Äôve thought about trying this for a while but I was finally spurred on to do it after I visited Licia He‚Äôs studio in April. 
This article is not intended as a tutorial, but more of a scrapbook of what I‚Äôve been trying, the results I‚Äôve created and the mistakes I‚Äôve made (and continue to make). 
Set up
There are a variety of ways to control an AxiDraw plotter. I do it by creating svgs using JavaScript. I open the svg in Inkscape and use the AxiDraw plugin to control the plotter. 

If you‚Äôre wondering how to create an svg‚Ä¶</p>

                  <p>YouTuber Nerrel takes James Cameron to task for releasing 4K remasters of Aliens and True Lies that have been, well, ruined by using AI to clean them up.
The best 4k releases tend to follow a pretty simple template: clean and scan the negative, repair any obvious signs of damage, and restore the colors to match the original grading, with as little meddling beyond that as possible. The process should not be about modernizing the style or forcing film to look like digital video. 35mm film was capable of incredible picture quality, and 4k is the first home format capable of delivering most of that detail ‚Äî that should be enough. A well done 4k is like having a pristine copy of the original negative to watch in your own home, with the full data from that celluloid ‚Äî grain and detail alike ‚Äî digitally preserved forever. And that‚Äôs the problem with deep learning algorithms ‚Äî they can‚Äôt preserve details. They make their best guess about what an object is supposed to be, then pull new details out of their digital assholes and smear them across the screen.


If Hollywood and one of its best directors don‚Äôt care enough about their movies to do them right, how are they supposed to convince us to care about their movies?

Reproduced from a rare original copy, the book features over 165 highly-detailed scans of the legendary art by Jos√© Luis Garc√≠a-L√≥pez, with an introduction by Paul Levitz, former president of DC Comics.
First issued in 1982, the Style Guide aimed to assist licensees in delivering a consistent look for DC‚Äôs Super Heroes. The reissue is based on the original copy held by Standards Manual, containing an amalgam of pages added by the owners of the original from ‚Äò82 to ‚Äò85.

                  <p>A UK research team has discovered that the more CO2 air contains, the longer viruses can stay alive in that air. This is a tranmission double-whammy: poorly ventilated spaces with lots of people in them increases potential viral load and longevity.

                  <p>I really enjoyed this profile by William Finnegan of 75-year-old Jock Sutherland, who was one of the best surfers in the world in the late 60s and who still cherishes a good wave.
A surfer as famous as he was could have made enough money for an easy retirement, I thought, but Sutherland hadn‚Äôt cashed in. Surfing was never, to his mind, a job. Even when he was at the apex of the surfing world, he was unimpressed, stubborn. There was no pro tour in those days. ‚ÄúYou could work for a board manufacturer, maybe have your own signature-model board,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúBut that meant sell, sell, sell. That was‚Ä¶crass. I mean, the banality. It was antithetical to being able to enjoy being out in the water.‚Äù


Sutherland‚Äôs mom, Audrey, sounds like an amazing person:
Audrey drew up a list of things that every child should be able to do by age sixteen and stuck it on the wall. It read, in part:
- Clean a fish and dress a chicken
- Write a business letter
- Splice or put a fixture on an electric cord
- Operate a sewing machine and mend your own clothes
- Handle a boat safely and competently
- Save someone drowning using available equipment
- Read at a tenth grade level
- Listen to an adult talk with interest and empathy
- Dance with any age
This list changed with the times, adding computers and contraception, and nobody really kept score, but everybody got the idea.


Finnegan wrote Barbarian Days, a memoir of his life as a surfer ‚Äî I loved it.

                  <p>The first Black Barbie doll was created and sold in 1980. Black Barbie, a documentary streaming on Netflix later this month, tells the story of how the doll came to be and the impact it had on a generation of young people who were able to see themselves in a doll with the same color skin, perhaps for the first time.
The trailer opens with this line: ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôve gone your whole life and you‚Äôve never seen anything made in your own image, there is damage done.‚Äù Which is then echoed later in the trailer when a little girl is describing her Barbie: ‚ÄúReally pretty, and has lochs, just like me‚Äù.
Shonda Rhimes produced the film and was recently on the Today show talking about the importance of representation. And here‚Äôs a tour of Sonya Larson‚Äôs collection of 1000+ Black Barbie dolls.

                  <p>Oh, there‚Äôs a new Sally Rooney novel coming out just a few days before my birthday? Now you all know what to get meeeee. It‚Äôs called Intermezzo and here‚Äôs the synopsis:
Aside from the fact that they are brothers, Peter and Ivan Koubek seem to have little in common.
Peter is a Dublin lawyer in his thirties ‚Äî successful, competent, and apparently unassailable. But in the wake of their father‚Äôs death, he‚Äôs medicating himself to sleep and struggling to manage his relationships with two very different women ‚Äî his enduring first love, Sylvia, and Naomi, a college student for whom life is one long joke.
Ivan is a twenty-two-year-old competitive chess player. He has always seen himself as socially awkward, a loner, the antithesis of his glib elder brother. Now, in the early weeks of his bereavement, Ivan meets Margaret, an older woman emerging from her own turbulent past, and their lives become rapidly and intensely intertwined.
For two grieving brothers and the people they love, this is a new interlude ‚Äî a period of desire, despair, and possibility; a chance to find out how much one life might hold inside itself without breaking.


According to her UK publisher, here are the novel‚Äôs opening lines:
Didn‚Äôt seem fair on the young lad. That suit at the funeral. With the braces on his teeth, the supreme discomfort of the adolescent.


Already hooked. You can preorder Intermezzo at Amazon or Bookshop.

                  <p>A group of photographers, editors, and curators recently convened to choose a list of ‚Äúthe 25 most significant photographs since 1955‚Äù. Choosing just 25 photos to represent 70 years of the richest visual era in human history is just an impossible task, so there‚Äôs bound to be some grousing about individual choices. (I love Beyonc√© but really?) But the selection is fascinating, includes a few images I‚Äôd never seen before, and the accompanying discussion is worth reading.
I would love to see a process that asks for nominations across a 
ranked choice voting or pairwise ranking. Paging The Pudding‚Ä¶

                  <p>At some point, you have to wonder what‚Äôs actually in the $1.50 Costco hot dog + drink combo to be able to offer it at that same price since 1984. (Costco sells more hot dogs annually than every MLB stadium combined.)

                  <p>Bradley Hart creates pointillist paintings by painstakingly injecting acrylic paint into the individual bubbles in bubble wrap. The paint leaks out of the bubbles and onto a canvas backing, which also becomes part of the creative output (which he calls the ‚Äúimpression‚Äù). Here‚Äôs Hart‚Äôs version of Picasso‚Äôs Le R√™ve, bubble wrap and impression:

And here‚Äôs Georges Seurat‚Äôs A Sunday on La Grande Jatte:

And the impression:

From Hart‚Äôs artist‚Äôs statement:
The bare bubbles in the bubble wrap reference dots or pixels, echoing various movements in art history and other media, including pointillism, screen-printing, TVs and LCD monitors. In today‚Äôs world people do not print their pictures for an album. Their albums are on Facebook, Flickr and Instagram, all exotic rote, yet combinations of 1‚Äôs and 0‚Äôs. The process of injecting paint into bubble wrap directly references pixilation (and those 1‚Äôs and 0‚Äôs) and at the same time harkens back to the time of family portrait painting, when a family‚Äôs personal ‚Äúphoto‚Äù album consisted of paintings hanging on its walls.


It‚Äôs such a genius idea to use the backing canvas as a separate artwork ‚Äî I love that. (via clive thompson)

Rich kids should go to public schools. The mayor should ride the subway to work. When wealthy people get sick, they should be sent to public hospitals. Business executives should have to stand in the same airport security lines as everyone else. The very fact that people want to buy their way out of all of these experiences points to the reason why they shouldn‚Äôt be able to. Private schools and private limos and private doctors and private security are all pressure release valves that eliminate the friction that would cause powerful people to call for all of these bad things to get better. The degree to which we allow the rich to insulate themselves from the unpleasant reality that others are forced to experience is directly related to how long th‚Ä¶</p>

                  <p>I was a little too young (and culturally sheltered ‚Äî like I‚Äôd never heard of New York magazine) in 1985 to really understand what the heck the Brat Pack was (not to mention what the name was referencing), but as a child of the 80s, I obviously grew up watching movies and TV shows that featured these actors. According to Wikipedia (which is a good read if you‚Äôre unfamiliar with the whole thing), here are some of the actors that were in the Brat Pack (or Brat Pack-adjacent): Emilio Estevez, Anthony Michael Hall, Rob Lowe, Andrew McCarthy, Demi Moore, Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald, Ally Sheedy, Tom Cruise, Charlie Sheen, James Spader, Robert Downey Jr., John Cusack, and Matthew Broderick.
The Brat Pack moniker was coined in a 1985 New York magazine article and it stuck. And according to some of the members, it ruined lives, careers, and friendships. Now one of the group members, Andrew McCarthy, has directed a documentary about the group: Brats. From Deadline:
Brats looks at the iconic films of the 1980s that shaped a generation and the narrative that took hold when their young stars were branded the ‚ÄúBrat Pack.‚Äù McCarthy reunites with his fellow Brat Packers ‚Äî friends, colleagues and former foes, including Rob Lowe, Demi Moore, Ally Sheedy, Emilio Estevez, Jon Cryer, Lea Thompson and Timothy Hutton, many of whom he had not seen for over 30 years ‚Äî to answer the question: What did it mean to be part of the Brat Pack? The actor-filmmaker also sits down for a first-time conversation with writer David Blum, who fatefully coined the term Brat Pack in a 1985 New York Magazine cover story.


That trailer definitely hooked me in. Brats will be available on Hulu on June 13.

                  <p>Hello! I‚Äôve been writing about git on here nonstop for months, and the git zine
is FINALLY done! It came out on Friday!
You can get it for $12 here:
https://wizardzines.com/zines/git, or get
an 14-pack of all my zines here.
Here‚Äôs the cover:

who is this zine for?
I wrote this zine for people who have been using git for years and are still
afraid of it. As always ‚Äì I think it sucks to be afraid of the tools that you
use in your work every day! I want folks to feel confident using git.
My goals are:
To explain how some parts of git that initially seem scary (like ‚Äúdetached
HEAD state‚Äù) are pretty straightforward to deal with once you understand
what‚Äôs going on
To show some parts of git you probably should be careful around.  For

                  <p>Hey everyone!
This is the list of all the changes we&#x27;ve done to our projects during the month of May.
Summary Of Changes
100r.co, added Frances Bay, Yuculta and Dent Rapids, Shoal Bay, Port Neville, Telegraph Cove, Port McNeill, Fury Cove, Prince Rupert, B.C. north coast anchorages, US Southeast Alaska and United States.
Paradise, implemented paradise in Modal.
Note Pad, added pen tool and line styles.
Oekaki, rect tool uses brush settings.
Adelie, tga images are now dithered.
Left, fixed issue for non-qwerty keyboards.
We spent this month moving northward through both southern and northern British Columbia. We&#x27;ve been moving almost every day, stopping every night to anchor, sleep and recuperate. Sailing near land is not as relaxing as sailing offshore, this reef-strewn coast requires careful navigation. We&#x27;ve had many long days of endless tacking from one side of the channel to the other, almost all the way to Port McNeill, then after that we started to get more weather from the south for some mostly pleasant, but cold and rainy, downwind sailing. We&#x27;ve been using our woodstove a lot, in evenings it helps warm the boat after a long sail.
On May 29th, 623 nautical miles miles after leaving Victoria, we arrived in Prince Rupert, our last major port in British Columbia before we head north to Southeast Alaska. Then, on June 2nd, we arrived in Ketchikan, Southeast Alaska. Most of our updates this month detail some of the places we&#x27;ve been(see the above list). To see our path, look at Western Canada and us se alaska. We update the map as we find internet.
We&#x27;ve seen sea otters, lots of humpback whales, two pods of orcas(one pod had a baby tagging along), eagles, and lots of mountains. In other non-travel related news, Devine is going to speak again at Handmade Seattle this upcoming November!

                  <p>‚ÄúEach of the tracks is supposed to be a different mystical garden.‚Äù 
I almost didn‚Äôt read this Q&amp;A with jazz musician Miguel Atwood-Ferguson in the latest issue of Tricycle Magazine, but I‚Äôm glad I did. His debut album, Les Jardins Mystiques, came out last year ‚Äî after 14 years in the making ‚Äî and is streaming in full on Bandcamp. I like the music, but this was my favorite bit from the interview: 
Since I‚Äôm not trying to be popular, I‚Äôm not trying to win awards, I‚Äôm not trying to do anything other than be sincere and share what is most authentically me, the worst thing I could do is be fake or do anything disingenuous. That‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt make a short, easy-to-digest album. I wanted to attract my tribe and scare away the people that don‚Äôt have the ability to focus or that would be annoyed.

                  <p>How do we know how dogs see? Are they colorblind? Nearsighted? How do they perceive movement? Does their excellent sense of smell help dogs see? The first episode of Howtown from Adam Cole &amp; Joss Fong is all about dog vision and is predictably fascinating.

                  <p>I loved looking at some of the items from the Letterform Archive related to the representation of letters with fabric (knitting, cross-stitch, weaving, etc.) Also, I did not know this re: the word ‚Äútext‚Äù:
The word ‚Äútext‚Äù originated from the Latin word ‚Äútextus,‚Äù which means ‚Äúa weaving‚Äù or ‚Äúa fabric.‚Äù In ancient times, textus referred specifically to the process of weaving fabric. Over time, the meaning of the word expanded to include written or printed material, reflecting the idea of words being woven together to create a coherent written work. This metaphorical extension continues today with words and phrases such as seamless, threadbare, unraveled, looming, frayed, tangled, and spinning a yarn, highlighting the connection between the physical act of weaving fabric and the intellectual act of composing written language, both of which involve the interlacing of individual elements to create a unified whole. In this installment of For Your Reference, we revisit the Archive‚Äôs stacks for books and other items that build a tangible connection between threads and letterforms.

Far away¬†in an isolated Russian village called Kamarchaga, located in¬†the Siberian¬†Taiga, lives a creative and dedicated pensioner named Olga Kostina who has meticulously decorated the exterior of her home with 30,000 plastic bottle caps.
Olga collected the bottle caps over the course of many years and only began to hammer them into place once she felt she had accumulated enough. Clearly this is a person with tremendous patience. The bottle caps have been carefully arranged into colourful, detailed¬†mosaics depicting traditional¬†macrame¬†motifs and local woodland creatures. Each bottle cap has been hammered into place by Olga herself. It comes as no surprise to learn that her awesome home has since become something of a local landmark.

                  <p>Ok, this is super freaky: this is a regular analog piano being played by a computer-controlled mechanical machine and it sounds like a person speaking. If you hadn‚Äôt seen this before, (it‚Äôs from 2009) take a listen:

Deus Cantando is the work of artist Peter Ablinger. He recorded a German school student reciting some text and then composed a tune for the mechanical player to sound like the recitation. I cannot improve upon Jason Noble‚Äôs description of the work:
This is not digital manipulation, nor a digitally programmed piano like a Disklavier. This is a normal, acoustic piano, any old piano. The mechanism performing it consists of 88 electronically controlled, mechanical ‚Äúfingers,‚Äù synchronized with superhuman speed and accuracy to replicate the spectral content of a child‚Äôs voice. Watching the above-linked video, it may seem that the speech is completely intelligible, but this is partially an illusion. The visual prompt of the words on the screen are an essential cue: take them away, and it becomes much harder to understand the words. But it is still remarkable that the auditory system is able to group discrete notes from a piano into such a close approximation of a continuous human voice, and that Ablinger was able to do this so convincingly using a conventional instrument (albeit, played robotically).


This is so cool, I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôd never seen it before. (via @roberthodgin)

And I believed that I‚Äôd get to do the things that Indiana Jones did and go on exciting adventures. I even dreamed up ideas for movies that my friends and I could make and star in. But they never went any further. I did, however, end up working in user experience (UX). Now, I realize that there‚Äôs an element of theater to UX‚ÄîI hadn‚Äôt really considered it before, but user research is storytelling. And to get the most out of user research, you need to tell a good story where you bring stakeholders‚Äîthe product team and decision makers‚Äîalong and get them interested in learning more.

                  <p>From Life magazine and photographer Ralph Crane, a gallery of outtakes from the filming of Conquest of the Planet of the Apes in 1972.
The Century City mall, selected for its futuristic appearance, was a primary battleground in the plot. LIFE staff photographer Ralph Crane came to the set and took pictures of the costumed actors in the mall, trying on shoes and making eyes at the lingerie store display, as well as eating in the mess hall with their masks half off. The pictures make for easy laughs, capturing the kind of shenanigans that help liven up a fourth Apes film in as many years.

                  <p>I have to admit, The Bear is a little up and down for me. But the highs (Forks, Fishes, Honeydew) are so high that it‚Äôs well worth the effort. Anyway, the trailer for season three dropped yesterday and, no surprise, it looks intense.
So. Much. Unaddressed. Trauma. That these people are inflicting upon one another. (Men will literally open a Michelin-starred restaurant instead of going to therapy.) It seems like Carmy, not the restaurant, is the titular Bear. (via laura olin)

                  <p>Former NBA player and TV sportscaster Bill Walton died on Monday at the age of 71. He was a quirky dude and as someone who‚Äôs been known to veer off onto seemingly unrelated tangents, I appreciated his oddball broadcasting style. Basketball was good for Walton but it also ruined his body. In response, he turned to biking to keep active and to get around.
I am the luckiest guy in the world because I am alive and I can ride my bike. It is the ultimate celebration of life when you go out there and are able to do what you can do. I have not been able to play basketball for 34 years. I have not been able to walk for enjoyment or pleasure or exercise in 41 years, but I can ride my bike.


In a brief clip of a talk Walton gave (at the University of Arizona, I believe, the custodian of Biosphere 2), he elaborated on how important his bicycle was to him:
I love my bike. My bike is everything to me. My bike is my gym, my church, and my wheelchair. My bike is everything that I believe in going on in the Biosphere. It‚Äôs science, it‚Äôs technology, it‚Äôs the future, engineering, metallurgy - you name it, it‚Äôs right there in my bike. My bike is the most important and valuable thing that I have.


Walton knew: the bicycle is low-key one of humankind‚Äôs greatest inventions:
By contrast, a person on a bicycle can go three or four times faster than a pedestrian, but uses five times less energy in the process. He carries one gram of his weight over a kilometer of flat road at an expense of only 0.15 calories. The bicycle is the perfect transducer to match man‚Äôs metabolic energy to the impedance of locomotion. Equipped with this tool, a person outstrips the efficiency of not only all machines but all other animals as well.


As one of the commenters on this post said, ‚ÄúTailwinds and smooth asphalt forever, buddy.‚Äù

Michael Sharp, of the beloved crossword puzzle blog Rex Parker Does the NYT Crossword Puzzle. (I started following relatively recently but now read it daily, leaving it perpetually open on my phone.) Sharp also teaches English Literature at Binghamton University, runs a vintage paperback blog called Pop Sensation, and tweets about The Lamps of Film Noir at The Lamps of Film Noir.
Rex, have you read (watched, listened to, or otherwise experienced) anything good recently?
Swann‚Äôs Way, the first of the seven volumes, and it‚Äôs exquisite. And hilarious. I did not expect Proust to be hilarious.

What‚Äôs something you‚Äôve read or seen that changed your life, even in a small way?

                  <p>Noah Kalina on viewing old photos or videos of yourself:
I think that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so uncomfortable for some people to watch old videos of themselves. It exposes the core of who you really are.
No matter what you try to do, no matter where you end up going, no matter how much you might try to change, you are who you are, and that very particular and unique type of personality you have stays with you forever.
It‚Äôs fascinating, painful, revelatory, and embarrassing.


The photo above is my 6th grade school picture from 1984. I loved that velour vest for reasons I cannot presently fathom. When I think about who that kid was and who I am now, I hope that I‚Äôve retained the best parts and let go of the things that didn‚Äôt serve him so well. It‚Äôs a process‚Ä¶
Counterpoint (or perhaps complementary point): I think often of this old post from The Sartorialist about a woman who reinvented herself upon moving to New York:
Actually the line that I think was the most telling but that she said like a throw-away qualifier was ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know anyone in New York when I moved here‚Ä¶.‚Äù
I think that is such a huge factor. To move to a city where you are not afraid to try something new because all the people that labeled who THEY think you are (parents, childhood friends) are not their to say ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not you‚Äù or ‚Äúyou‚Äôve changed‚Äù. Well, maybe that person didn‚Äôt change but finally became who they really are. I totally relate to this as a fellow Midwesterner even though my changes were not as quick or as dramatic.

                  <p>Scientists have figured out why killer whales are smashing up luxury yachts: it‚Äôs a new fad among teen orcas. ‚ÄúA combination of free time, curiosity and natural playfulness has led to young orcas adopting this ‚Äòtrend‚Äô of boat-bumping.‚Äù

                  <p>Two of my biggest childhood touchstones were Sesame Street and the Muppet Show. The creative spark behind both shows was Jim Henson, the subject of a forthcoming documentary directed by Ron Howard. From the press release:
Produced with the full participation and cooperation of the Henson family, ‚ÄúJim Henson Idea Man‚Äù is an unprecedented, intimate look at Henson‚Äôs illustrious, revolutionary career and complex personal life. Using never-before-seen personal archival home movies, photographs, sketches, and Henson‚Äôs personal diaries, as well as interviews with those who knew him best, the film is the definitive portrait of one of the world‚Äôs most inspiring and iconoclastic creators.


Jim Henson Idea Man will be available to stream on Disney+ on Friday. (via the kid should see this)

                  <p>I‚Äôm coding a system in JavaScript that generates sentences of ‚Äúmeaningful nonsense‚Äù.  Here are some examples. 
I set off on this path because I‚Äôm working on a series of generative diagrams and I wanted them to have titles. Immediately I was drawn in by the effect of the diagrams next to the semi-nonsensical words. Since then, I have developed these diagrams a lot, including using my sentence generating system to add scribbled notes to the sides of them. 
Here‚Äôs an early example and one of where my diagrams are up to now. 
I have also been using this system to generate ‚Äútruths‚Äù and to provide content for typographical artworks. All of this is an ongoing experimental work in progress but I‚Äôd like to share how it works so far.

                  <p>Favourite book of my year: wonderful.
I loved the characters. I&#x27;ve loved the story telling. I loved the passion around work. I loved the love between the characters.
Crossing multiple decades but the crux takes place during the height of 1990s PC gaming. i.e. shortly after Doom - and our characters are games makers.
Though the weaving part is their company that makes games, I wouldn&#x27;t call this a &quot;gamer&#x27;s book&quot;. I&#x27;m certainly not a gamer by their measure, but the story put into their game design and the love they have is infectious.
The book left me genuinely inspired. The character Marx makes me want to be more like him. He has purpose in helping others without being a martyr.
What&#x27;s more, the book left me wanting to make. I love that hungry creative feeling (even if it&#x27;s slightly dampened by having too many projects!).
Loved it. Strong recommend.</p>

                  <p>A few weeks ago, friend of the blog Nat Bennett wrote this article on lying to get jobs. It is strongly against lying, and the central thesis is that habitually lying is going to put you into a world where everyone is lying all the time, and every morning you wake up and think &quot;Why am I surrounded by malevolent grifters that do nothing but backstab each other every day? Why is everything in the tech stack Excel? Why is standup an hour long? Why, dear God, why, why, why?&quot;
I&#x27;m somewhat sympathetic to the &quot;man I need the job&quot; line but this &quot;well a manager lied to me first?&quot; thing ‚Äì just play the fucking tape forward. Just put your anti-capitalist self-righteousness on hold for one goddamned second and think. If your model is &quot;it&#x27;s okay to lie if I&#x27;ve been lied to&quot; then we&#x27;re all knee deep in ‚Ä¶</p>

There are also cool new features on Ferris in Vulture and WaPo, as well as some sweet Part Two micro teasers on Desert Island Comics‚Äô Instagram.

Finally, it‚Äôs here, the book everyone has been clamoring for: woke retellings of Aesop‚Äôs fables, by Oscar-winning actress Natalie Portman! In Portman‚Äôs version of ‚ÄúThe Three Little Pigs,‚Äù the first two pigs unwisely build their houses out of fast-food leftovers and plastic drinking straws. The wolf blows their houses down to warn them that only sustainable, environmentally friendly building practices are acceptable.


Lol.

3. The Most Misunderstood Emojis of 2024, in Axios. The revolving hearts don‚Äôt make the list, but maybe we cracked the code on those. üíû

                  <p>Until his recent incarceration, Wilfred Rose was a very successful pickpocket operating on the streets of NYC.
Some of the thieves have a shtick. There is Francisco Hita, who when caught touching someone‚Äôs wallet, pretends to be deaf, the police say, responding with gesticulations of incomprehension. There is an older man who pretends to be stricken by palsy while on a bus, and then uses a behind-the-back maneuver to infiltrate the pocket of the passenger next to him.
There are flashy dressers, like the 5-foot-3 Duval Simmons, whose reputation is so well known among the police that he says he sometimes sits on his hands while riding the subway, so he cannot be accused of stealing. Mr. Simmons, an occasional partner of Mr. Rose‚Äôs, said he honed his skills on a jacket that hung in his closet‚Ä¶</p>

                  <p>From the SoundWorks Collection, this is a 30-minute featurette on the sound design of Dune, in which the film‚Äôs sound teams talks about how they created the sounds of the Arrakis desert, the sandworm, ornithopters, spice, and the voice of the Bene Gesserit.
That‚Äôs something which - I learned a trick from Lee Scratch Perry, who I worked with in Switzerland about 10 years ago. He‚Äôs the pioneer of dub reggae, which must be the genre of music with the most bass. And one of the tricks that he used was to record a bass line and then to play it back through a huge speaker in a room that‚Äôs resonant‚Ä¶and record that. So it enhances the resonance of the bass. You also hear something of the shaking of the room. So that was one of the tricks that we used to give a sort of a very tactile sense to this spiritual adventure that Paul‚Äôs going on.

                  <p>Growing up, my friends and I were in the unenviable position of being first language English speakers who were enamored by Western culture. The life of eleven year olds that read Eragon instead of playing football was isolated, to say the least. The main escapes we had in a world where we attended thousands of hours of schooling without being able to communicate with our Malay-speaking teachers was reading and gaming. And the main game we played, on ancient hardware and dial-up connections, was Runescape, a small browser-based online game that was created by two brothers from their parent&#x27;s house which somehow turned over ¬£120M in revenue in 2022.
The world and community of the game have accumulated so many layers of history and nuance that I feel like I could muse for months without exhau‚Ä¶</p>

                  <p>Based on an analysis of leaked PIN numbers by Nick Berry, Information is Beautiful made this visualization of the most common PINs.

According to the analysis, just 20 4-digit numbers account for 27% of all PINs: 1234, 0000, 7777, 2000, 2222, 9999, 5555, 1122, 8888, 2001, 1111, 1212, 1004, 4444, 6969 (nice), 3333, 6666, 1313, 4321, 1010. The diagonal line is people using repeated pairs of digits (e.g. 2727 or 8888) while the horizontal line near the bottom is people who are presumably using their (19xx) birth year as a PIN. (You can see the beginning of a 20xx line on the left side.)
The best causally unguessable PINs would seem to be unrepeated pairs of numbers greater than 50 ‚Äî so 8957, 7064, 9653, etc. Choose wisely.

                  <p>San Francisco‚Äôs Arion Press still uses decades-old machines to make beautiful books by hand. They‚Äôre one of the few remaining presses in the world that do everything from start to finish ‚Äî they even cast their own type. 
Arion dwells in an almost extinct corner of the book world: Call it Slow Publishing. It produces only three books a year, each a unique art object reproduced in editions of less than 300. Art is so important, in fact, that the illustrators-art-world luminaries-drive the title selection process.
‚ÄúWe learned that the projects went a lot more smoothly when we said to the artist, ‚ÄòWhat do you want to do?‚Äô‚Äù Blythe said.


Anthony Bourdain visited Arion in 2015 for a online series called Raw Craft ‚Äî it‚Äôs a great look at how and why they produce books this way:

Business Insider‚Äôs Still Standing series recently profiled Arion as well:

                  <p>The Gyermekvas√∫t (Children‚Äôs Railway) is a 7-mile-long rail line in Budapest that‚Äôs operated by children aged 10-14 (aside from the train‚Äôs driver).
Children‚Äôs Railway, Budapest is one of Budapest‚Äôs most unique attractions. Like any other railway, it has ticket offices, diesel locomotives, signals, switches and a timetable. Unlike other railways though, this one is run by children. The line stretches among the Buda hills from Sz√©chenyihegy to H≈±v√∂sv√∂lgy, crossing the Cogwheel Railway and serving Normafa as well as the highest point of Budapest: J√°noshegy.


The project, then called the Pioneer‚Äôs Railway, was started in 1947 as a part of a three-year Communist plan. This video shows how the railway operates and includes interviews with current workers as well as former workers from the Communist era:

Seems like all the kids are big train nerds‚Ä¶adorable.

                  <p>Kurzgesagt is back with another video about black holes; it has the innocuous-seeming title of The Easiest Way To Build a Black Hole. But the main topic of the video is the speculation that universes (like ours!) might exist within black holes.
Black holes might create infinite universes while destroying time and space. Everything in existence could be black holes, all the way down. We might live inside a black hole that is inside a black hole, that is inside a black hole. But let‚Äôs start at the beginning and build a black hole out of air.


This one is a bit of a brain-bender. From the show notes:
The first part of the script is based on the empirical fact that, somewhat intriguingly, the observable universe seems to have the exact size and mass that would be required to make a black hole as big as the observable universe itself.
The second, completely independent proposal we explore is the idea that our Universe could be born from the singularity of a black hole, and that in turn the universe that contains that black hole could be born from a black hole itself. If so, universes in later generations of this process could be better fitted to produce an abundance of black holes, in a sort of ‚Äúnatural selection‚Äù towards efficient black hole production.

I agree. That video contained more information than a 44-minute episode of Mythbusters but the pace and energy were more relaxed.

                  <p>Jon Stewart is back on The Daily Show on a regular basis and the other day he took on the manufactured outrage that is cancel culture.
Nothing about the right wing reaction is surprising because the idea that there is an all pervasive, all powerful threat to free speech called cancel culture has become a central tenet of modern conservatism. They celebrate their being silenced at conferences. They celebrate their being silenced on podcasts and streaming outlets. They celebrate their being silenced with over 700 book titles about being canceled. Why are there so many of these fucking books?
Conservatives have an entire industry devoted to complaining about not being allowed to say the things they say all the time. Their victimhood is the entire brand.


And:
We are not censored or silenced. We are surrounded by and inundated with more speech than has ever existed in the history of communication.

                  <p>This is such a wild story. Two men, Thomas James Cobden-Sanderson &amp; Emery Walker, founded the Doves Press in London in 1900. They made a typeface called Doves Roman:
During its short life early last century, the Doves Press printed and bound some of the finest books ever produced in England and its approach to typography and printing subsequently exerted a major influence over book design in Europe and the United States. Many of Cobden-Sanderson‚Äôs ideas would, decades later, find expression or adaptation in both Traditionalist and Modernist circles respectively.

Website technology is becoming increasingly complex and energy intensive, with big companies like Meta and Google leading the dance. ‚ÄãIs this necessary? What does it really take to get our content online?
‚ÄãLow‚Üêtech Magazine &amp; Antoine Jaunard are teaming up to bring you a low-tech website making workshop. ‚ÄãIt takes place in Barcelona, at Akasha Hub, on 25 May from 3 to 6 pm.
‚ÄãTogether, we will demystify web technologies by making websites that are simple to create and modify. Websites that can be hosted anywhere, even on a DIY solar powered server.
The workshop will be in English or Spanish depending on you. Come as you are. And just bring your computer.

                  <p>I just started a rewatch of Chernobyl and was struck by the opening lines of the first episode spoken by Jared Harris, who plays Soviet nuclear physicist Valery Legasov:
What is the cost of lies? It‚Äôs not that we‚Äôll mistake them for the truth. The real danger is that if we hear enough lies, then we no longer recognize the truth at all. What can we do then? What else is left but to abandon even the hope of truth and content ourselves instead with stories? In these stories, it doesn‚Äôt matter who the heroes are. All we want to know is: Who is to blame?

                  <p>Well this is delightful: Vanity Fair set up Ayo Edebiri with a selection of personal beefs and several gavels (and maybe there‚Äôs a meat tenderizer in there, I don‚Äôt know), she listened to both sides of each argument, and then passed judgment. Listen until at least the second case before you pass judgment on watching the whole thing (verdict: you should)‚Ä¶it involves someone stealing a french fry from a room service tray.
I don‚Äôt know how to tell you this‚Ä¶but your father has murdered people before. There are bodies in the ground. ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know what she‚Äôs so upset about. It‚Äôs a victimless crime. Nobody‚Äôs gonna miss that fry. Nobody‚Äôs gonna miss THAT KID!‚Äô

                  <p>The Great Wave off Kanagawa by Katsushika Hokusai is one of the world‚Äôs most iconic pieces of art. Hokusai created the woodblock print in 1831 at the age of 71 as part of his series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji. But in some sense, he‚Äôd been working on it all of his life.
In 1797, at the age of 37, Hokusai made what could be interpreted as his first wave print, Spring at Enoshima (Enoshima shunb√¥):

Hokusai made his next attempt in 1803 (age 43) with View of Honmoku off Kanagawa (Kanagawa-oki Honmoku no zu):

Two years later in 1805 (age 45) came Express Delivery Boats Rowing through Waves (Oshiokuri hat√¥ ts√ªsen no zu) and it‚Äôs starting to look familiar:

A few waves show up in Hokusai‚Äôs three-volume Quick Lessons in Simplified Drawing (1812).

                  <p>From Business Insider‚Äôs series Still Standing, a look at La Maison du Pastel, a 300-year-old French company that makes pastels for artists by hand. Back in its golden age, the company supplied the likes of Monet &amp; Degas but fell into neglect near the end of the 20th century. The newest generation of ownership has restored the company and they now offer over 1,900 different pastel colors.
Seriously, take a look at their online shop‚Ä¶there‚Äôs all sorts of amazing stuff in there. Like this antique watercolors set ‚Äî get a load of these color names: Violet Lake, Burnt Lake, Carmine, Venice Red, Vermilion, Orange Chrome, Gamboge, Zinc White, Yellow Ochre, Burnt Umber, Van Dyck Brown, Lamp Black, Payne‚Äôs Gray, Indigo, Celestial Blue, Blue Ash, Prussian. You can even order a full set of their pastels for only ‚Ç¨29,450.00 (the set comes with a custom-made chest of drawers).
I am not at all an artist but these colors all look so amazing that I‚Äôm eyeing one of the smaller sets for myself‚Ä¶ (thx, caroline)

                  <p>Queendom is a documentary film by Agniia Galdanova about queer Russian activist and performance artist Jenna Marvin and her unusual form of protest against the war in Ukraine and Russia‚Äôs treatment of LGBTQ+ people. From a short review in the Guardian:
When Russia invaded Ukraine in February last year, some brave souls took to the streets of Moscow to voice their horror at the war, and were met with batons and police brutality. Radical queer performance artist Gena Marvin took a different approach. Wearing platform boots, body paint and wrapped in barbed wire, she walked the streets of Moscow in a stark, silent statement against the war. To call Gena a drag artist fails to capture just how subversive and courageous are her public ‚Äúperformances‚Äù. Her otherworldly costumes, created from junk and tape, show the influence of Leigh Bowery; her fearlessness evokes the punk provocation of Pussy Riot.


Marvin‚Äôs performances can be intense ‚Äî check out this video from Pars in 2022. France had just advanced into the semifinals of the World Cup and she went out on the streets dressed in an all-black costume straight out of Alien or Pan‚Äôs Labyrinth:

Queendom opens in theaters and will available on streaming on June 14.

                  <p>I.
I turned 30 today.
I&#x27;ve taken a few stabs at this post, and nothing came out feeling right. I wanted to write about Terry Pratchett, the writing process itself, programming, improv theater, career nonsense, direction, and all the other bits in life that warrant reflection. Normally I try very hard to try and narrow my writing down to a single topic - just imagine how chaotic they&#x27;d be without that! - but my birthday present to myself is that I&#x27;m going to write about whatever the fuck1 I want, in whatever way I want, and everyone&#x27;s gonna have to take it or leave it.
That&#x27;s probably meta-commentary on what happens when you get older.
The first version of this post opened with.
As I write this, I&#x27;m slated to turn thirty in about forty eight hours. It&#x27;s going to happen while I&#x27;m out in Fiji‚Ä¶</p>

MacAskill and four friends take to the local mountain bike trails around Inverness, Scotland on ebikes and have a grand old time. For me, listening to the banter was just as entertaining as watching the riding ‚Äî it‚Äôs obvious they‚Äôre just out there having a blast.
P.S. I was also trying to calculate how fast I would die if I tried riding some of that stuff and the answer is ‚Äúalmost immediately‚Äù. Yiiiikes.

                  <p>The other day while singing to my daughter, I realized that I can, in fact, sing better than I used to. I think the sheer amount of ‚ÄúWheels on the Bus‚Äù and ‚ÄúRow, Row, Row Your Boat‚Äù did the trick: I enjoy it more now and feel like I‚Äôm hitting more of the right notes. I‚Äôm still not ‚Äúgood,‚Äù but I‚Äôm not bad, and I‚Äôm less embarrassed to be caught singing in front of other people. It reminds me of the Terry Gross detail that she took voice lessons not to become a better singer but simply so she could sing along more pleasurably to music she loved. 
Has anyone else been singing anything fun lately? For their kids, or in any other situation? I‚Äôve been singing a lot of Carrie Anne, by The Hollies.

                  <p>I Was (Am?) Addicted to Exercise for the newsletter Platonic Love: 
I never deviated from or relaxed my exercise routine; it was sacred. As long as I exercised, my body wouldn‚Äôt slip back into its old state. I‚Äôd be safe.


And last week, Rod Gilchrist wrote I Was a Running Addict for The Guardian: 
The trouble is, once you‚Äôve got the running bug, it‚Äôs hard to scale back, even when your body demands it.
 

And a few days after that, The Guardian also ran I Thought Fitness Was My Superpower. Then I Realized It Was a Ball and Chain, by Sam Pyrah: 
I tried to push through it ‚Äì until, suddenly, neither my body nor my brain could find a reason to carry on. I slowed to a walk. I stopped my watch. I sat down and had a little cry, the sweat drying on my back. Then I walked home.


The essays remind me of a concept called Positive Addiction (and a 1985 book of the same name) ‚Äî the idea that it‚Äôs possible to be truly addicted to things that are good for you. I‚Äôm an almost-daily runner, and I do understand how it could be described as addiction, although for now I just love it. Maybe a key is that I don‚Äôt run especially long distances. And it‚Äôs a relatively new habit. But I guess there‚Äôs (hopefully) still plenty of time for it to sour.

                  <p>Can we emulate the upcoming CSS contrast-color() function via CSS features that have already widely shipped?
And if so, what are the tradeoffs involved and how to best balance them?
Relative Colors
Out of all the CSS features I have designed,
Relative Colors aka Relative Color Syntax (RCS) is definitely among the ones I‚Äôm most proud of.
In a nutshell, they allow CSS authors to derive a new color from an existing color value by doing arbitrary math on color components
in any supported color space:
--color-lighter: hsl(from var(--color) h s calc(l * 1.2));
--color-lighterer: oklch(from var(--color) calc(l + 0.2) c h);
--color-alpha-50: oklab(from var(--color) l a b / 50%);

The elevator pitch was that by allowing lower level operations they provide authors flexibility on how to derive color ‚Ä¶</p>

                  <p>You may have heard that this year, for the first time since 1803, two different broods of cicadas will emerge at the same time.
This year, though, will be a rare event. Two groups, or ‚Äúbroods,‚Äù are waking up during the same season. There will likely be billions, if not trillions, of the insects.
There‚Äôs the 17-year-group called Brood XIII, which is concentrated in northern Illinois (brown on the map below), and the 13-year clutch, Brood XIX, which will emerge in southern Illinois, Missouri, Arkansas, and throughout the Southeast.


You may have noticed the lengths of both periodicities (13, 17) are prime numbers ‚Äî and that does not appear to be a coincidence. Scientists haven‚Äôt nailed down an exact cause, but one hypothesis has to do with predator cycles:

                  <p>I am apparently one of the few people who really liked the first season of the Lord of the Rings prequel series, The Rings of Power. I mean, it had its rough spots and maybe there was a little too much table-setting, but in general it left me wanting to see what was going to happen next. The trailer for season two just dropped and it looks pretty action-packed and stocked with characters &amp; events that would be familiar to those who have read the main book series. Here‚Äôs the synopsis:
Sauron has returned. Cast out by Galadriel, without army or ally, the rising Dark Lord must now rely on his own cunning to rebuild his strength and oversee the creation of the Rings of Power, which will allow him to bind all the peoples of Middle-earth to his sinister will. Building on Season One‚Äôs epic scope and ambition, the new season plunges even its most beloved and vulnerable characters into a rising tide of darkness, challenging each to find their place in a world that is increasingly on the brink of calamity. Elves and dwarves, orcs and men, wizards and Harfoots‚Ä¶ as friendships are strained and kingdoms begin to fracture, the forces of good will struggle ever more valiantly to hold on to what matters to them most of all‚Ä¶ each other.


And they also released a behind-the-scenes look at the production of season two:

The second season of The Rings of Power premieres on August 29 on Amazon Prime.

The end began like this: One evening, after the last game of the high-school season, I asked my son if he‚Äôd be trying out for spring league. For a youth-hockey kid, playing spring league is the equivalent of a minor-league pitcher playing winter ball in Mexico ‚Äî so necessary as a statement of intent and means of improvement that forgoing it is like giving up ‚Äúthe path.‚Äù Rather than a simple affirmative nod, as I‚Äôd expected, I got these words: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to think about it.‚Äù Think about it? For me, this was the same as a girlfriend saying, ‚ÄúWe need to talk.‚Äù

                  <p>Thanks to the Instagram account New American Paintings, I recently came across the work of Los Angeles-based artist Delia Brown, including the above portrait, ‚ÄúJai Maa! (Justine II),‚Äù which I love. A feature on Brown in Independent Art Fair magazine also includes an awesome painting of hers from 2000 called ‚ÄúWhat, Are You Jealous?‚Äù (probably NSFW).
Someday ‚Äî someday! ‚Äî I want to turn down an invitation to something because ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt, I‚Äôm sitting for my portrait at that time.‚Äù
Elsewhere in portraits: King Charles‚Äôs, by Jonathan Yeo. ‚ÄúIn his interview with the BBC,‚Äù the NYT‚Äôs Vanessa Friedman writes, ‚ÄúMr. Yeo noted that when the king first saw the painting, he was ‚Äòinitially mildly surprised by the strong color,‚Äô which may be an understatement.‚Äù
Many more of Brown‚Äôs paintings can be found on her website and Instagram.

                  <p>Francis Ford Coppola has been making Megalopolis since 1983 and has self funded it ‚Äúin part by the sale of a significant portion of the director‚Äôs wine empire‚Äù. But the trailer is finally here and it premieres at Cannes in two days‚Äô time. Here‚Äôs a synopsis shared by Coppola himself:
A man balances precariously on a ledge high above a once-grand city in the opening scene of Francis Ford Coppola‚Äôs MEGALOPOLIS, and the movie that follows is ‚Äî at least in part ‚Äî about an entire civilization teetering on a similarly precarious ledge, devouring itself in a whirl of unchecked greed, self-absorption, and political propaganda, while a few bold dreamers push against the tide, striving to usher in a new dawn. The man is called Caesar (Adam Driver), like the Roman general who gave rise to the Roman Em‚Ä¶</p>

                  <p>Google is replacing their search results with AI answers. There‚Äôs a very simple explanation for this: it‚Äôs better/cheaper to provide potentially wrong answers to keep you clicking within Google than it is to send you away for the right answers.

                  <p>Hey folks. I‚Äôve posted a couple of times about Hot Frank Summer, the group read of Mary Shelley‚Äôs Frankenstein (1831 edition) that some folks are doing on Bluesky. Well, it kicks off today. To participate, all you need to do is follow the reading schedule. If you don‚Äôt have a copy of the book yet, check out this free ebook version by Standard Ebooks ‚Äî they even have a web version you can read on your phone or tablet (or Vision Pro, I guess?). 
If you‚Äôd also like to discuss the book (and/or follow along with others discussing the book), there‚Äôs this feed on Bluesky. I found this little tidbit on the feed:
Frankenstein takes place in the mid-1790s and Moby Dick may take place as early as 1830, so it‚Äôs possible Captain Walton sailed with a young Ahab.


Someone needs to write that little crossover prequel.
Anyway, you can also use this comment thread as a place to discuss the book. I‚Äôm not sure how well it will work, but we can give it a try? I‚Äôd suggest not discussing anything ahead of the day‚Äôs reading, but other than that, let ‚Äòer rip!

AI &quot;art&quot; and uncanniness (permalink) When it comes to AI art (or &quot;art&quot;), it&#x27;s hard to find a nuanced position that respects creative workers&#x27; labor rights, free expression, copyright law&#x27;s vital exceptions and limitations, and aesthetics. I am, on balance, opposed to AI art, but there are some important caveats to that position. For starters, I think it&#x27;s unequivocally wrong ‚Äì as a matter of law ‚Äì‚Ä¶</p>

                  <p>Osita Nwanevu on the recent US campus protests:
The student left is the most reliably correct constituency in America. Over the past 60 years, it has passed every great moral test American foreign policy has forced upon the public, including the Vietnam war, the question of relations with apartheid South Africa, and the Iraq war. Student activists were at the heart of the black civil rights movement from the very beginning. To much derision and abuse, they pushed for more rights, protections and respect for women and queer people on their campuses than the wider world was long willing to provide. And over the past 20 years in particular, policymakers have arrived belatedly to stances on economic inequality, climate change, drug policy and criminal justice that putative radicals on campus took up long before them.
They have not always been right; even when right, their prescriptions for the problems they‚Äôve identified and their means of directing attention to them have not always been prudent. But time and time and time again, the student left in America has squarely faced and expressed truths our politicians and all the eminent and eloquent voices of moderation in the press, in all of their supposed wisdom and good sense, have been unable or unwilling to see. Straining against an ancient and immortal prejudice against youth, it has made a habit of telling the American people, in tones that discomfit, what they need to hear before they are ready to hear it.

                  <p>Oh man, I screwed up big-time you guys and owe you an apology. The great Erik Larson (The Devil in the White City, The Splendid and the Vile, In the Garden of Beasts) came out with a new book two weeks ago and I somehow missed it! I almost shrieked when I saw it on the bookstore front table yesterday.
Anyway, the book is called The Demon of Unrest: A Saga of Hubris, Heartbreak, and Heroism at the Dawn of the Civil War (bookshop.org). Here‚Äôs the synopsis:
On November 6, 1860, Abraham Lincoln became the fluky victor in a tight race for president. The country was bitterly at odds; Southern extremists were moving ever closer to destroying the Union, with one state after another seceding and Lincoln powerless to stop them. Slavery fueled the conflict, but somehow the passions of North and South‚Ä¶</p>

The photos above are by Albert Dros and Sean O‚Äô Riordan (prints here). O‚Äô Riordan took his shot in Tasmania and actually had to tone it down for publication:
When the clouds are glowing red you know something is off the charts, I tried my best to desaturate this and make it look some bit like a photo and not a science fiction scene!

                  <p>Lovely old time detective story.
I do love an old book. Written in 1958, post war in Japan, mostly a story about...sort of...trains.
I knew Japan was big on trains (similarly to the UK, it&#x27;s our mode of transport), but reading about how they would plan their journey often sleeping overnight, upright, on the train to get from one place to another.
The crime is linked to trains and journeys and planning.
It&#x27;s a nice, short enough, straightforward detective story that cross from one generation of detective (old, slow, &quot;classic&quot;), to young(er) and determined.
There are parts where I&#x27;m wondering what real evidence they have to follow up or chase down particular individuals, but it gets a pass being nearly 70 years old.</p>

                  <p>Using the Barbie movie and other media (movies, TV shows) as a guide, Pop Culture Detective delves into what ‚Äúpatriarchy‚Äù actually means (mirrors: Patreon &amp; archive.org).
We‚Äôre going to use the movie as a sort of primer to help explain what patriarchy actually is, what it isn‚Äôt, and how it ends up harming everyone, including men. To have any kind of productive conversation, we have to get over that defensiveness that so many men feel whenever they they come across the word ‚Äúpatriarchy‚Äù. Contrary to popular belief, patriarchy is not a synonym for men, nor is it a code word for masculinity, and it certainly has nothing to do with hating men.


The bibliography in the description of the video lists three books if you‚Äôd like to do some reading on the topic:
The Gender Knot: Unraveling Our Patriarchal Legacy by Allan G Johnson.
The Will to Change: Men, Masculinity, and Love by bell hooks.
Masculinities by R. W. Connell.


(via waxy)
P.S. While I was watching this video, YouTube removed it after Warner Brothers ‚Äúblocked it on copyright grounds‚Äù. The channel is challenging the takedown and has uploaded it to Patreon and archive.org in the meantime. (I‚Äôm leaving the embed in case it comes back to life.) This bullshit is so irritating ‚Äî Google just totally letting massive media corporations decide what‚Äôs copyright infringing without recourse. And Warner (and Gerwig &amp; Robbie too to some lesser extent)‚Ä¶you made the fucking movie to get a message across and to get people talking and someone posts a thoughtful video essay about the central issue of the film and you fucking take it down?

                  <p>NASA used one of their supercomputers to model what it would look like if you flew into a supermassive black hole. (You can watch the simulation in a 360¬∞ view on YouTube. I bet it looks great on a VR rig like Apple Vision Pro.)
The movies begin with the camera located nearly 400 million miles (640 million kilometers) away, with the black hole quickly filling the view. Along the way, the black hole‚Äôs disk, photon rings, and the night sky become increasingly distorted ‚Äî and even form multiple images as their light traverses the increasingly warped space-time.
In real time, the camera takes about 3 hours to fall to the event horizon, executing almost two complete 30-minute orbits along the way. But to anyone observing from afar, it would never quite get there. As space-time becomes ever more distorted closer to the horizon, the image of the camera would slow and then seem to freeze just shy of it. This is why astronomers originally referred to black holes as ‚Äúfrozen stars.‚Äù
At the event horizon, even space-time itself flows inward at the speed of light, the cosmic speed limit. Once inside it, both the camera and the space-time in which it‚Äôs moving rush toward the black hole‚Äôs center ‚Äî a one-dimensional point called a singularity, where the laws of physics as we know them cease to operate.
‚ÄúOnce the camera crosses the horizon, its destruction by spaghettification is just 12.8 seconds away,‚Äù Schnittman said. From there, it‚Äôs only 79,500 miles (128,000 kilometers) to the singularity. This final leg of the voyage is over in the blink of an eye.

                  <p>Artificial intelligence has the potential to transform many sectors across the economy. The sports realm isn‚Äôt excluded from that.¬† New technologies are already changing the way sports are played, viewed and consumed. From enhancing athlete recovery, to live performance tracking and influencing rule changes, AI‚Äôs plunge into sports is providing leagues more data and analysis [‚Ä¶]

                  <p>If you play carefully by not stomping enemies, not collecting coins, not eating mushrooms or flowers, and hopping on the flagpole at the very last second, you can rescue the princess in Super Mario Bros with only 500 points.

One bit is surprisingly tricky:
How tough is that jump in 8-1? Well, the timing of the liftoff, the duration of holding the jump button, and the timing of the wall jump are all frame perfect. NES games run at 60 frames per second, which means all the necessary inputs need to be timed within 1/60 of a second. In addition, the starting position before running I used not only has to be on the right pixel, but also the x sub-pixel has to fall within a certain range (technical stuff blah blah blah). In short, it‚Äôs a pretty annoying jump.


When I was a kid, I left my NES on for three straight days to flip the score in SMB, using the 1UP trick and another spot in the game to get many lives and points. Scoring lower would have been a lot quicker.

                  <p>choral music playlist the other day, with the preceding lines as an intro, and the idea of a ‚Äúlast instrument‚Äù was pleasingly creepy to me. It also reminded me of the above video, of artist Maria Coman singing the ‚ÄúLove is patient, love is kind‚Äù lines from the First Epistle to the Corinthians, from the Bible. (1 Corinthians 13: 1-8.) More of Coman‚Äôs music can be found on her website. And what is that church she‚Äôs in?

                  <p>The Greatest Life Hacks in the World (For Now).‚Äù It was mostly a tribute to Kevin Kelly‚Äôs famous life advice posts, but Brooks added one of his own, and  I‚Äôve thought of at least once a week since: 
‚Ä¶over the last few years I have embraced, almost as a religious mantra, the idea that if you‚Äôre not sure you can carry it all, take two trips.


Take two trips. Nothing serious, but of all the ‚Äúlife advice‚Äù posts I‚Äôve read, this is the one that‚Äôs changed my own life the most. Anyone else have something from an advice list that really made it into their brains/lives?
The closest thing to a life advice aphorism I‚Äôve ever come up with is maybe too gross to write down. And it‚Äôs running-themed, so it could be too specific. But maybe if I share it here, I will exorcise it from my brain: Sometimes you‚Äôre so worried about pooping your pants that you don‚Äôt realize you‚Äôve already pooped your pants.

                  <p>A few weeks ago, I popped open the Y-Combinator application form and saw that one of the only things they ask for is a story about hacking a non-technical system. Well, I don&#x27;t really have a reason to beg for money, lacking an unprofitable idea to beeline for an IPO1 with, but I did find myself really wanting to write about this. Starting with all the hacking I did at university.
I have many, mostly vaguely negative, feelings towards university, which many people find odd coming from someone that did exceedingly well at it. The majority of the experience can best be summarized as occasionally having the privilege of being near extremely smart teachers and students, but most of the time I was being lavishly praised for doing very easy things, while watching the majority of my peers desperat‚Ä¶</p>

                  <p>As someone who reads almost exclusively on an ereader (a Kindle Paperwhite), I have been intrigued by Craig Mod‚Äôs recent evangelism of the BOOX Palma, a pocket-sized e-ink device that he‚Äôs been using as an ereader. In the latest issue of his Roden newsletter, he explains why he likes it so much:
Once you hold a Palma, you realize that for most situations it‚Äôs an ideal reading container. On the train? In line? In the waiting room at the doctor‚Äôs office? I‚Äôve carried my Palma with me every day for the past three or so months with the goal of reaching for it rather than my iPhone. I call it the Gentle Librarian. Soft screen, clean interface, no SIM card and so mostly no internet (it loads up with new articles while at home on Wi-Fi; I can always tether to my phone to update or add something new to read on the go), a refresh rate that is plausible enough on which to watch movies (!! hypnotizing, actually, like watching a magic trick, like what Victorians may have imagined ‚Äúcomputer screens‚Äù to look like) but not really responsive enough to seduce you into installing social media apps. There‚Äôs a lot of friction in this little bugger, and it turns out a bit of friction is a good friend of the kind of reading we love.


Hmm. Hmm! Like Mod, I‚Äôm frustrated with Amazon‚Äôs lack of vision and activity on the ereader front and lament the time I spend on my Casino Rectangle / Dingdong Casino of Hell. Maybe I‚Äôll try the Palma out‚Ä¶

                  <p>I love these (haunting? are they haunting?) photos of Cate Blanchett taken by Jack Davison for this 2022 profile in the NY Times Magazine.
When the magazine asked the photographer Jack Davison to create the art for this story, he took inspiration from Cate Blanchett‚Äôs legendary gift at transforming herself on film. Over the course of a four-hour shoot, across nine different setups, Davison made the fantastical, perspective-bending portraits that appear here.

                  <p>A short essay on freediving. ‚ÄúIn the mindful state of freediving, I don‚Äôt panic. I find stillness. Centeredness. Calm. I am belonging in the moment. I‚Äôve retrained my mind to be underwater.‚Äù I love mind vs. body stuff like this.

                  <p>Ana Tudor, as always, shows excellent methods to create (what I&#x27;d call) retro print effects to images using CSS.
This is something I&#x27;ve typically turned to PhotoShop to (struggle) with, but Ana shows how this can be done with CSS.
In Ana&#x27;s CodePens, SCSS is used, but even the compiled CSS is relatively easy to follow.

                  <p>Zo√´ Schlanger‚Äôs new book (out today) sounds really interesting: The Light Eaters: How the Unseen World of Plant Intelligence Offers a New Understanding of Life on Earth (Bookshop.org).
It takes tremendous biological creativity to be a plant. To survive and thrive while rooted in a single spot, plants have adapted ingenious methods of survival. In recent years, scientists have learned about their ability to communicate, recognize their kin and behave socially, hear sounds, morph their bodies to blend into their surroundings, store useful memories that inform their life cycle, and trick animals into behaving to their benefit, to name just a few remarkable talents.


I heard about it from NPR‚Äôs Fresh Air ‚Äî check out this completely metal behavior:
Schlanger notes that some tomato plants, when being eaten by caterpillars, fill their leaves with a chemical that makes them so unappetizing that the caterpillars start eating each other instead. Corn plants have been known to sample the saliva of predator caterpillars ‚Äî and then use that information to emit a chemical to attract a parasitic wasp that will attack the caterpillar.
Schlanger acknowledges that our understanding of plants is still developing ‚Äî as are the definitions of ‚Äúintelligence‚Äù and ‚Äúconsciousness.‚Äù ‚ÄúScience is there [for] observation and to experiment, but it can‚Äôt answer questions about this ineffable, squishy concept of intelligence and consciousness,‚Äù she says.

                  <p>Do you remember the Broccoli Tree? Photographer Patrik Svedberg photographed a Swedish tree that resembled a broccoli floret over a number of years, posted the results to Instagram, and made the tree internet famous. Then some asshole vandal sawed through the branches of the tree and it had to be chopped down. John Green eulogized the Broccoli Tree in a video:
To share something is to risk losing it, especially in a world where sharing occurs at tremendous scale and where everyone seems to want to be noticed, even if only for cutting down a beloved tree.


Well, the stump of the tree was left in the hopes that it would grow again and I‚Äôm pleased to say that it has ‚Äî here‚Äôs a photo from three years ago:

You can even see it on Google Maps. I‚Äôm glad the tree is growing again but wish the destruction hadn‚Äôt happened in the first place.

Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2004, 2009, 2014, 2019, 2023 Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I&#x27;ve been.

                  <p>In honor of novelist C.J. Sansom‚Äôs passing, I wanted to recommend his marvelous Matthew Shardlake historical crime thrillers, for anyone who isn‚Äôt already familiar. I definitely learned and remembered more about Thomas Cromwell-era England from Dissolution than I did from any textbooks (not that I‚Äôve read any of those in a while, but still). It was all very visceral in a damp-stone-monastery, heavy cloaks, burning candles, teeth-being-pulled-in-the-Tower-of-London kind of way. Also his novels are just super fun, and the Matthew Shardlake character ‚Äî a sort of proto-detective lawyer ‚Äî is especially memorable.

                  <p>Gareth Fearn writing for the London Review of Books about the student protests on US campuses: Liberalism without Accountability.
This is a toxic combination: universities reliant on investment portfolios in a system where mega-profits are made by companies that threaten and destroy human life, influenced by an increasingly radicalised class of billionaires, teaching students whose degrees won‚Äôt earn them enough to pay off their loans, managed by supine administrators threatened by (or willingly collaborating with) a reactionary right, who have decided that young people‚Äôs minds are being turned against capitalism not by their own lived experience of austerity and racialised police violence but by ‚Äòwoke Marxist professors‚Äô. This situation has now met with a live-streamed genocide which is supported, and brazenly lied about, by political leaders and commentators who claim to stand for truth and justice. Students, like much of the public, cannot square the reality of what they see with the world as constructed by politicians and the media.
Under such circumstances, pitching tents, raising placards and demanding divestment are really quite mild-mannered responses. That they have been met, in many US universities, with militarised policing reflects the fragility of liberalism ‚Äî in the face of the growing hegemony of the conservative right as well as its own inability to offer a future even to Ivy League college students, let alone the less privileged.

Skateboarding has always been such an urban-coded sport ‚Äî surfing on concrete, reliant on the human-made infrastructure against which it rebels ‚Äî that it‚Äôs a little bit of a mindbend to see it out in nature like this.

                  <p>Recently, some of the items from the personal collection of the late artist Jason Polan were auctioned off. The NY Times wrote about the effort to preserve his legacy.
Jen Bekman, the founder of the online gallery 20x200, reflected on Mr. Polan‚Äôs legacy while she sat beside his sketches.
‚ÄúThese are not doodles,‚Äù Ms. Bekman said. ‚ÄúThat word is diminishing. People remember him as an illustrator, but Jason was a great artist, and his practice was his life.‚Äù


I ‚Äúlost‚Äù a bunch of time browsing through the collection this morning, which includes both work by Polan and things he collected &amp; received from other artists.




It‚Äôs great to see Polan‚Äôs legacy being preserved and his art being spread around the world. And to be reminded of that time he went to a fashion show.
I sort of stood still because I was a little confused as to what just happened. Kim walked right by me. Puff Daddy took a picture with someone right in front of me. I then saw Beyonc√© walking toward me and I said, ‚ÄúHi Beyonc√©,‚Äù and she said, ‚ÄúHeeey,‚Äù and smiled and it was kind of like having a Bar Mitzvah. Then Jay Z walked by and I said, ‚ÄúHi Jay,‚Äù and in the second I said that I thought, am I supposed to add a Z? but didn‚Äôt and he said hey but not as beautifully as Beyonc√©. I love her so much. I drew a couple more people and then went outside and forgot where I was and then walked to the train and went home.


Reminder: you can buy prints and things of Polan‚Äôs work at 20x200. I have several of these, including the Zoo Baggu, which I get compliments on almost every time I use it for grocery shopping.

                  <p>The trailer for Senna, a Netflix limited series about Brazilian F1 driver Ayrton Senna. Kinda skeptical about this, considering how great the documentary Senna (2010) is.

                  <p>The second issue of Road Snacks is out featuring an interview with Nashville-based singer/songwriter Jack Van Cleaf. I like his song Rattlesnake, maybe you will, too. Road Snacks is semi-regular interview series between an ice cream shop and a touring musician talking exclusively about food on tour. I have made it my mission to find out which snacky treats touring musicians live for.
Jack Van Cleaf: That‚Äôs the thing, when I get to the gas station, they only have the small bags. The price per pound ratio doesn‚Äôt appeal to me as much, but when I get those big bags from Costco, I don‚Äôt know, something about the endlessness of it. It really, really drives me.
Gracie‚Äôs: You get lost in the bottom of bag.
Jack Van Cleaf: I do, I do. Probably at the gas station I‚Äôm gonna go with a Reese‚Äôs Cup or a Take Five.
Gracie‚Äôs: Tell me anything else about food while touring?
Jack Van Cleaf: The gas station question has me thinking about Twist of Lime Hot Cheetos. Are you familiar with those?

                  <p>An officer ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù fired his weapon during an NYPD raid on a student-occupied building at Columbia University on Tuesday. Apparently, he mistook his gun for a flashlight. You may be wondering: how could this happen? Well, like this. From a 2014 article in the Denver Post:

Ronny Flanagan took pride in his record as a police officer in Plano, Texas. He had an incident-free career. He took safety training regularly. He was known at the range as a very good shot.
Yet he killed a man when he was simply trying to press a flashlight switch mounted beneath the trigger on his pistol.
In a deposition, Flanagan expressed his remorse and made a prediction.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want anyone to ever sit in a chair I‚Äôm in right now,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThink about the officers that aren‚Äôt as well trained, officers tha‚Ä¶</p>

                  <p>I enjoyed Ezra Klein‚Äôs podcast conversation with Nilay Patel, the editor of The Verge. They talked about media and AI mostly.
(First of all, anyone who says they‚Äôre trying to ‚Äúrevolutionize the media through blog posts‚Äù is a-ok in my book.)
Anyway, here‚Äôs Patel on the limitations of AI and where humans shine:
But these models in their most reductive essence are just statistical representations of the past. They are not great at new ideas.
And I think that the power of human beings sort of having new ideas all the time, that‚Äôs the thing that the platforms won‚Äôt be able to find. That‚Äôs why the platforms feel old. Social platforms like enter a decay state where everyone‚Äôs making the same thing all the time. It‚Äôs because we‚Äôve optimized for the distribution, and people get bored and that bored‚Ä¶</p>

                  <p>Nothing more exciting than knitted items! This isn‚Äôt news, but a relative sent it to me recently, and I see it also made the rounds on Reddit a few days ago. Here‚Äôs the gist, per the Rijksmuseum:
In 1980 archaeologists investigated the graves of 185 Dutchmen ‚Äî whale hunters, and workers at whale oil refineries ‚Äî who had died on or near Spitsbergen [an island in Norway‚Äôs Svalbard archipelago] in the 17th century. Many skeletons were still wearing their knitted woollen head coverings. These caps were highly personal. The men were bundled up against the severe cold and could only be recognized by the colours and patterns of their caps. Presumably this is the reason why the caps went with them into their graves.


The hats look remarkably modern, especially if you zoom in. And in fact here are some modern caps, called Deadman Hats, inspired by the old ones. (More info and context for the Dutch hats can be found in this 2016 post from the blog A Bluestocking Knits.)
And this is maybe tangential, but it reminds me of an 18th-century kerfuffle I read about once, in which the young poet Thomas Chatterton claimed to have discovered a 15th-century poem, until a reference within the poem ‚Äî to knitting ‚Äî gave it away as contemporary, and presumably as written by Chatterton himself. Or that‚Äôs how I remember it, anyway ‚Ä¶ Although it looks like subsequent research places the advent of knitting earlier than believed at the time. 
Even more tangential, to the above tangent: The smoking-gun reference to knitting doesn‚Äôt seem to actually appear in the poem, at least not as I‚Äôm currently finding it. (??) (The reference: ‚ÄúShe sayde as her whyte hondes whyte hosen was knyttinge, Whatte pleasure ytt ys to be married!‚Äù) ‚Ä¶ Actually, I think I‚Äôm in over my head. ‚Ä¶ The ‚Äúhistory of knitting‚Äù Wikipedia page also generally confirms this impression (of being in over my head).

                  <p>Year of Bach, it often includes more Bach than I can handle, but in a good way, and I like letting it wash over me. 
Yesterday‚Äôs installment was more of a primer ‚Äî I mean it was literally labeled ‚ÄúWhere to start with Bach‚Äù and ‚Äúa primer for new listeners‚Äù ‚Äî which was especially up my alley.  
Through this project, I‚Äôm attempting to write for the masses about a niche topic, which embeds the danger of writing for no one. So today I want to recognize my readers who are in earlier stages of their Bach journeys, and in this post I‚Äôll be recommending some of the grassier pathways into this music.
Of the tracks and musicians he linked to, my favorite is the Yo-Yo Ma, Chris Thile, and Edgar Meyer rendition of Bach‚Äôs Trio Sonata No. 6 in G Major (above), from their Bach Trios album of 2017. I also loved Brad Mehldau‚Äôs Prelude No. 3 in C Major from The Well-Tempered Clavier Book I, which Goldfine describes as ‚Äúdamned perfect, a one track playlist on repeat forever.‚Äù

                  <p>Since the early 70s, the Native Youth Olympics have showcased the traditional games of the Alaska Native people:
Our Alaska Native ancestors developed traditional games in order to test and prove crucial abilities that governed everyday life. Competition was created with each other to hone their ability to hunt and fish for daily survival in the traditional way of life. The creators of the NYO Games wanted an opportunity to demonstrate their favorite traditional Native contests of their forefathers.


I found out about this via a highlight reel on Instagram ‚Äî here‚Äôs last year‚Äôs competition highlights:

You can check out a list of the competitive events; they include:
One-foot High Kick: ‚ÄúIn many cultures, the One-Foot High Kick was used for signaling a successful hunt.‚Äù
Indian Stick Pull: ‚ÄúThe Indian Stick Pull represents grabbing a slippery salmon, and was used traditionally to develop hand and arm strength.‚Äù



Kneel Jump: ‚ÄúHistorically, the Kneel Jump was a game used to strengthen the leg muscles for jumping from ice floe to ice floe, and for lifting prey after a successful hunt.‚Äù



Seal Hop: ‚ÄúThe Seal Hop is a variation of the Inuit Knuckle Hop, and used traditionally as a game of endurance and stamina, and for sneaking up on a seal, mimicking the mammal‚Äôs movement on the ice.‚Äù



Two-foot High Kick: ‚ÄúThe Two-Foot High Kick was historically used to communicate the success of a spring hunt.‚Äù

I love these events. I think my favorite is a reintroduced event for the 2024 games (just concluded): the Toe Kick, which returned after a 10-year hiatus. Here‚Äôs how you do it:

Here‚Äôs a short documentary about the NYO and athlete Autumn Ridley from 2013 ‚Äî her event is the Alaskan High Kick, perhaps the most impressively athletic event:

                  <p>My therapist and I have yet to figure out why, but I have a soft spot for objects that do unexpected impressions of other things and people. Like this sliding door that sounds like R2-D2 screaming. Or the falling shovel that plays Smells Like Teen Spirit. Or the door that can do a wicked Miles Davis impression. Or the nightstand door that sounds like Chewbacca. I even found one of my own a few months ago: the elevator door at the old Buzzfeed office sounded like Chewbacca as well. (via @williamlubelski)
Update: Here‚Äôs a video full of things that sound like Chewbacca.

                  <p>Hey everyone!
This is the list of all the changes we&#x27;ve done to our projects during the month of April.
Summary Of Changes
100r.co, added Twilight, updated our notes on chainplates, wheel to tiller conversion, cabin lights standing rigging replacement, Princess Louisa Inlet(added maps), Goji no Chaimu(added maps), and Sailing to Japan(fixed some dead links).
Hakum, released a new comic sequence called Kaizah.
Wunderland Rabbits, released a new Rabbit travel photo
Orca, added a note on the repository for the Javascript version titled Is Orca dead?
Devine has been busy working on the implementation and documentation of wryl&#x27;s fantastic programming language Modal. Rewriting systems are a computation paradigm that is generally unknown and under-explored that might have some fascinating features that might be able help us to tackle some of our future projects.
In other news, Pino is ready to head northward! We finished all of our boats projects and left the dock on May 1st. See a photo of our first day of the year on the water, taken as we exited Enterprise Channel, just north of Trial Island south of Victoria. On our travels we will continue to push updates every month like usual, but the updates will only go live when we find internet, and this may or may not coincide with the start of every month. We will keep a log of our travels, populated with plenty of drawings!
Pino book &amp; movie club
Book Club: This month we are reading The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand.

                  <p>These bubblegum sculptures created and photographed by artist Suzanne Saroff are delightfully disgusting.



I found this via Grace Ebert at Colossal, who writes:
Conjuring memories of childhood competitions and absent-minded chomping, the photos zoom in on chewed wads of pink, blue, and green that appear almost corporeal, their pudgy folds and pockets evoking the beauty and repulsion of the human body.


I love these but grrrrossssss. (And I don‚Äôt know why, but these remind me of Roe Ethridge‚Äôs photo of Andrew W.K.)

                  <p>Oh wow, this takes me right back to my childhood: Electronic Plastic, a museum of portable, old-school electronic toys. We didn‚Äôt have a gaming system in my house growing up ‚Äî I had to settle going over to my friend Steve‚Äôs house for Atari 2600 and my big city cousins‚Äô Intellivision ‚Äî but we did have a couple of these handheld games. Specifically: Baseball (upper right), Football 2 (lower left), and Q*bert (lower right). The football game was my favorite. I played it for hours and hours ‚Äî so many touchdowns. (And look at these Soviet handhelds!)
Friends at school had other games: I particularly remember the watches, some of the mini arcade cabinets from Coleco, and these pre-Game Boy Nintendo handhelds. The teachers hated them‚Ä¶I think they probably got banned at some point.
I know that my dad still has these games stashed somewhere in the house I grew up in‚Ä¶I‚Äôd love to play Football 2 again. ü§ñüèà (via present and correct)

                  <p>Data artist Robert Hodgin recently created a feedback loop between Midjourney and ChatGPT-4 ‚Äî he prompted MJ to create an image of an old man in a messy room wearing a VR headset, asked ChatGPT to describe the image, then fed that description back into MJ to generate another image, and did that 10 times. Here was the first image:

And here‚Äôs one of the last images:

Recursive art like this has a long history ‚Äî see Alvin Lucier‚Äôs I Am Sitting in a Room from 1969 ‚Äî but Hodgin‚Äôs project also hints at the challenges facing AI companies seeking to keep their training data free of material created by AI. Ted Chiang has encouraged us to ‚Äúthink of ChatGPT as a blurry jpeg of all the text on the Web‚Äù:
It retains much of the information on the Web, in the same way that a jpeg retains much of the information of a higher-resolution image, but, if you‚Äôre looking for an exact sequence of bits, you won‚Äôt find it; all you will ever get is an approximation. But, because the approximation is presented in the form of grammatical text, which ChatGPT excels at creating, it‚Äôs usually acceptable. You‚Äôre still looking at a blurry jpeg, but the blurriness occurs in a way that doesn‚Äôt make the picture as a whole look less sharp.


And we already know what you get if you recursively save JPEGs‚Ä¶

                  <p>That‚Äôs the title of a poem by Matthew Olzmann. It begins:
Tell me what it‚Äôs like to live without

You can read the rest at Tin House.
From Lacy M. Johnson in Orion Magazine, The Brutal Legacy of the Longleaf Pine:
The oldest longleaf pine tree in the world, I remember, is a nameless tree in Weymouth Woods in North Carolina. It is roughly 474 years old, taking root around the time Michelangelo took over construction of the dome of St. Peter‚Äôs Basilica, fifty-nine years before European colonizers arrived at Jamestown. In 2016, when the tree turned 468, visitors to the North Carolina State Parks system held a ‚ÄúParty for the Pine.‚Äù They celebrated by hiking to the tree, cutting cake, singing it ‚ÄúHappy Birthday.‚Äù

                  <p>This year, the React team unveiled something they&#x27;ve been quietly researching for years: an official way to run React components exclusively on the server. This is a significant paradigm shift, and it&#x27;s caused a whole lot of confusion in the React community. In this tutorial, we&#x27;ll explore this new world, and build an intuition for how it works, and how we can take advantage of it.</p>

                  <p>Edith here. For the latest installment of my newish illustrated column, I interviewed my friend and neighbor, the artist and climate activist Zaria Forman. Zaria makes pastel drawings of ice, among other things, and her solo show ‚ÄúFellsfjara, Iceland‚Äù is currently on exhibition at Winston W√§chter gallery in New York until May 4. (I‚Äôve rendered a miniature version of some of it right below these words, but definitely click here for the actual images.) Zaria is also on Instagram. 



Zaria, have you read, watched, listened to, or otherwise experienced anything good recently?
Poor Things. It was so visually stimulating and imaginative ‚Äî more than anything I‚Äôve seen in a while.

Possibly more interesting: the ice storm a few weekends ago! I‚Äôd never seen an ice storm before moving to upstate Ne‚Ä¶</p>

                  <p>TV critic James Poniewozik writing for the NY Times:
Mid TV, on the other hand, almost can‚Äôt be bad for some of the same reasons that keep it from being great. It‚Äôs often an echo of the last generation of breakthrough TV (so the highs and lows of ‚ÄúGame of Thrones‚Äù are succeeded by the faithful adequacy of ‚ÄúHouse of the Dragon‚Äù). Or it‚Äôs made by professionals who know how to make TV too well, and therefore miss a prerequisite of making great art, which is training yourself to forget how the thing was ever done and thus coming up with your own way of doing it.
Mid is not a strict genre with a universal definition. But it‚Äôs what you get when you raise TV‚Äôs production values and lower its ambitions. It reminds you a little of something you once liked a lot. It substitutes great casting for gre‚Ä¶</p>

                  <p>The Louvre wants to put the Mona Lisa in its own room to improve visitor experience. Here‚Äôs my suggestion: two rooms, 1 w/ the Mona Lisa (timed entry, no photos) and 1 w/ a fake (free-for-all, selfies, usies, etc.)

                  <p>The heart break of time travel.
I enjoyed this book. The time travel core mechanic is‚Ä¶okay. It&#x27;s not perfect/bullet proof, but it works to create the impossible problem.
The main character is, a little all over the place. It&#x27;s not enough to be distracting, but often I found myself thinking &quot;this guy isn&#x27;t helping himself&quot; as he&#x27;d continuously make the same mistakes. Maybe this could have been edited out.
Without giving too much away, the main character gets stuck out of time for several decades and so eventually makes a life for himself. A family and some happiness.
Then, he&#x27;s pulled back to his timeline (in the future) without any prospect of returning or even attempting closure with his wife and daughter.
The story goes on to attempt to deal with the question: could you let go?
The big problem being knowing when to let go. There&#x27;s no good time.
I&#x27;ve thought a lot about this in my personal life, which I think is why I could connect to the torment that the protagonist faces.
Not hard science, not a heart string puller, but thoughtful. Even if I wanted to shake the protagonist!</p>

Our relationship to our birch relatives, our salmon relatives, and all the beings of Alaska are sacred. Our traditional stories tell us that at one point we all spoke the same language ‚Ä¶ we still do. If we find the time to truly listen, we might recognize ourselves in the melting permafrost or the fallen birch, but we might also recognize ourselves in the songs of the birds or the freshness of the Arctic breeze. There is still hope when we experience life. We should all fall in love with the places we live and let this love drive our determination to protect the waters, the salmon, the caribou, and all our plant relatives so that future generations may also experience such joy and sustenance.


Have a good weekend, everyone.

                  <p>This is great: a 25-minute interview with legendary animator Chuck Jones as he sits and draws some of his iconic characters (Bugs Bunny, Porky Pig, Daffy Duck). He told this anecdote about how Steven Spielberg and George Lucas were both influenced by a particular space-themed cartoon of his:
Porky was just a kind of a little third-string Boy Scout and was not very interesting to me. And then when I put him in a picture called Duck Dodgers in the 24th and a Half Century. Spielberg used that picture in Close Encounters the Third Kind - when his kids were watching television in the picture, they were watching Duck Dodgers in the 24th and a Half Century. And Lucas told me that he saw that picture when he was 12 years old and when when he opened Star Wars in San Francisco he told them they couldn‚Äôt have Star Wars in San Francisco unless they ran Duck Dodgers in the 24th and a Half Century.

                  <p>Absolutely essential reading and viewing on how to produce captions with valuable real world examples of how to completely mess it up (and a lot of social posted videos do the bad mess version).
As someone who&#x27;s hard of hearing and uses captions on all viewing media that I can, I already feel this.
Excellent post by Meryl Evans.

                  <p>The other day, the novelist Robin Sloan mentioned in his newsletter that he really liked the Financial Times. It seems everyone‚Äôs talking up the Financial Times lately, so I went and followed them on Instagram. 
The first post in their feed was for an essay by Janan Ganesh, about how although the American self-help industry makes it seems like most mistakes can be salvaged, many are in fact unsalvageable and life-destroying. An excerpt: 
The sur¬≠prise of middle age, and the ter¬≠ror of it, is how much of a per¬≠son‚Äôs fate can boil down to one mis¬≠judge¬≠ment.
Such as? What in par¬≠tic¬≠u¬≠lar should the young know? If you marry badly ‚Äî or marry at all, when it isn‚Äôt for you ‚Äî don‚Äôt assume the dam¬≠age is recov¬≠er¬≠able. If you make the wrong career choice, and real¬≠ise it as early as age 30, don‚Äôt count on a way back. ‚Ä¶ A big [mistake], or just an early one, can fore¬≠close all hope of the life you wanted.


At first I found it oddly cheering (if I can‚Äôt fix my mistakes, I might as well relax and accept my circumstances), but then I found it sad. (Does my husband feel like he made a life-destroying mistake by marrying me? LMAO.) Now I‚Äôm more like ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø because things can only ever go the way they go. Anyway, I‚Äôm not yet a FT subscriber, but it was a nudge.

                  <p>Here is a pleasantly painful trailer for a new movie from the filmmaker Joanna Arnow. It opens this Friday, April 26, at IFC and Lincoln Center in NYC. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm going to watch it, but I couldn‚Äôt really look away. 
Arnow also stars as‚Ä¶ 
an emotionally detached young Brooklynite drifting through unremarkable days and nights. Neither her on-again-off-again BDSM relationship with a mildly disinterested older dom, nor her nondescript corporate job, appear to bring her any satisfaction.


And yet ‚Äúshe finds a core of poignant truth about the ways people search for ‚Ä¶ emotional happiness and sexual gratification‚Äù (per the Lincoln Center summary). It‚Äôs currently at a 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, FWIW. (This bit also made me laugh out loud.)

                  <p>I think knitters are often fascinated by the fact that I use such tiny needles. Some of the needles are almost the dimension of a human hair.


Sublimely absurd, perfection. More info in Reactor. [Thanks, Tobias!]
And here‚Äôs another pic, grabbed from Crome‚Äôs website: 

I don‚Äôt know about you, but this makes me want to drop everything and disappear into the process of knitting a microscopic sweater for the next six months. Like her Starry Night one. 
Actually, the Starry Night sweater should just be its whole own post: 

‚ÄúI love the paradox of creating an object that takes the form of something you can wear,‚Äù Crome writes, ‚Äúyet is impossible to wear.‚Äù 
(Her work is also for sale.)

                  <p>I love this: The Pudding ran an online experiment where they started with a shape (like a straight line or circle) and asked people to trace, as best they could, the tracing of the person before them. This resulted in a series of ‚Äúflipbook‚Äù animation of how the shapes evolved over time ‚Äî invariably, a squiggle.

One thing I noticed right away was how all the squiggles ended up squished over on the right side of the screen. The Pudding team had a theory on why that happened (the 3:20 mark in this video):
I found this study from like 35 years ago - they were trying to figure out why people kept missing their targets on touch screens. They found people tended to touch below their target and people tended to touch closer to the edges of the screen. And so I figure if it‚Äôs like right-handers who are missing, you‚Äôre going to be missing to the right. We probably had about half the users on mobile and 90% of the those half are probably going to be right-handed so it would make sense that it would gradually go to the right.


Go read the rest of the post ‚Äî they also did an experiment about people‚Äôs inclination to draw penises on ‚Äúany free-form drawing project on the internet‚Äù. (via waxy)

                  <p>As someone who is interested in birds but doesn‚Äôt know a whole lot about them, this new animated video series from Will Rose is right up my alley. What Bird Is That? is a beginners guide to birding. The second episode, embedded above, is all about how to identify birds from their calls.
What‚Äôs that bird that sounds like Star Wars singing on my roof? What bird sings it‚Äôs own name? What‚Äôs that laughing sound you heard in the woods?


Right now, I ‚Äúcheat‚Äù by using Cornell Lab of Ornithology‚Äôs eBird app, which allows you to record a bit of birdsong and it‚Äôll ID the bird for you. (via the kid should see this)

                  <p>Cutting to the chase: text editors *and* tabs vs. spaces!  Ooooh!


I&#x27;ve had this thing called &quot;e&quot; for a while now.  It&#x27;s a stupid little 
script which serves to do a couple of things.  It starts my 
editor
with a given file, and it kicks it with the right arguments to make it 
disable line wrapping and to make the [TAB] key actually put in two 
spaces.


So, my dumb script would use &quot;-w -E -T 2&quot; most of the time, except when it 
was running on a Makefile, at which point it would skip those args.  
Simple enough, right?


pico is back?  Yes indeed, on Macs, as of 12.3, pico is in fact back.  To 
make sure I wasn&#x27;t imagining things, I tracked down a machine that hadn&#x27;t 
been upgraded yet and checked there.  Sure enough, it was in fact nano and 
not pico.


macOS 12.3 has nano as a symlink... pointing to pico!


At some point, I switched from literal tab characters in my source code to 
blobs of spaces, probably due to using that style at work and not hating 
it.  So, somewhere along the line I actually started depending on nano 
behavior without realizing it.


As for the lack of a feature in pico itself, it&#x27;s kind of strange, really.  
If you go digging into the source, they have this random.c with a function 
called tab which claims to &quot;simulate tab stop&quot; using spaces.  That said, I 
can&#x27;t find any place where it would be called with the magic values which 
would make it behave that way.


It wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if this switch is just more of Apple removing 
GPLed things from their OS - pico seems to use the Apache license.  They 
dumped bash for zsh (MIT license) at some point (Big Sur, I think), and 
now this?  Okay then.</p>

                  <p>Here&#x27;s a very old and stupid trick you could do with some filesystems in 
some situations back in the day... and might still be able to do in a 
few places today.


The problem is that while version X might eventually have an exploit, 
it&#x27;ll get removed and it&#x27;ll be replaced by version Y without that
particular hole.  By the time you get your hands on a tool to break into 
X, it&#x27;ll be gone.


What you&#x27;d do is create a hard link pointing at the file you wanted to 
preserve, storing it in a spot which was writable by your account.  
Then, say, /usr/bin/sudo (because that never has security 
issues...) gets replaced at some point with a new file and you get to 
keep the old version.  When you get the tool to pop it, off you go!


Of course, these days, it&#x27;s not quite so easy on the more modern systems 
you find.  Debian 11 here won&#x27;t let me do it - it&#x27;s EPERM city.  Rocky 8 
(so CentOS 8 and RHEL 8 too) also won&#x27;t do it.  They both have some gunk
in /usr/lib/sysctl.d to lock this down.  But, my old Slackware 14.2 
install of my workstation let me do it the last time I tried about 
a year ago.  How about that, huh?  I bet it&#x27;d still work if I dug out 
the old drives and booted them up.


Incidentally, this is the magic sauce: /proc/sys/fs/protected_hardlinks
Read the man page for proc(5) to learn more about it.

here it is,
the thread I read a long time ago.  It&#x27;s interesting to note that as far 
as I can tell, nothing actually changed upstream.  This left paranoid 
admins like me with no option but to use the (most excellent) Openwall 
patches to lock down this kind of stuff.  I used that on my machines at 
work which had non-staff users... just in case.


This whole situation is scary.

                  <p>Back in January, you might have seen my
post
about a very large BBS which seemed to solve for the problem of &quot;how do 
we host a bunch of users&quot; by having one physical box per user.  It might 
have been one physical box per *two* users, maybe, but it&#x27;s hard to say.


Now, keep in mind digital cameras weren&#x27;t easy to come by, so I have 
very few actual pictures.  I&#x27;ll have to do a lot of explaining to make 
up for the lack of detail and alternate angles.  Clearly, I had no 
notion of ever using these pictures to tell stories 25+ years later.


Some friends at a local company had some bandwidth to spare (a T1 to 
Alternet somewhere, as I recall), so they parked a Zoom modem on one of 
their boxes and plugged it into a phone line.  We got an identical model 
to avoid cross-brand issues (Zoom m‚Ä¶</p>

offices before the whole COVID lockdown thing happened and people 
largely stopped going to offices every day.  With that in mind, let&#x27;s 
proceed.


However, tech companies decided to go past this at some point and 
brought about this whole notion of &quot;microkitchens&quot;.  This is where 
they&#x27;d put their branding on the coolers (instead of &quot;Coca-Cola&quot; or 
&quot;Pepsi&quot;) and would load it up with every kind of fizzy sugary liquid

                  <p>One of the fun things I used to do at a prior job was to dig through the 
raw data points which were collected from the *many* servers we had.  I 
could just pick an interesting-sounding metric and then would just ask 
the system to show me the top 10 or bottom 10 out of a population of 
thousands or more.


To get my feet wet with the whole &quot;investigations&quot; thing that we&#x27;d do, I 
started looking into this one day and chose one of the many temp sensors 
which were being logged by the servers.  I forget exactly which one it 
was, for there were many.  The CPUs logged it, the chassis logged it, 
the power supply logged it, and so on.  There were so many choices.


I went looking for a reason.  What could possibly explain this?  First 
off, it didn&#x27;t line up with any obvious pattern in the host names.  The 
hosts were named for whichever team owned them, followed by a sequence 
number that was bumped any time a new one was provisioned.  There was no 
signal to be found in that.


There was more, though.  You could also see a &quot;rack position&quot; in this 
data, and now it started getting interesting.  It seems that all of the 
really hot machines had a rack position of something low, like 04 or 05, 
and never anything higher than that.  In fact, when looking at a whole 
rack, it was always the lowest number of all of the positions that were 
being used.  Now this was worth chasing!


It&#x27;s good that I asked, since they told me something surprising: 
position 04 or 05 or whatever was the *bottom* of the rack.  Yes, 
somehow, the lowest machine in the rack was the hottest!  They found 
this interesting, too, and wound up digging into it.  Given that I was 
far away in a distant office, this was the best way for us to proceed.


The problem was that the bottommost server would have nothing below it 
but just open space until it got to the floor.  That space would not 
move air efficiently, and it obviously mattered.


This rolled out and my hot spots disappeared.  Fantastic!</p>

                  <p>Another day, another bit of local flavor, but this time it&#x27;s something I 
wish I didn&#x27;t have to write about.

wrote
about seeing a maintenance truck rolling down the Caltrain line in 
Mountain View.  It had a special attachment to let it stay on the rails.  
At no point did the arms come down for the crossing.  It managed to 
approach, then the people inside looked around and went through, and the 
arms never budged.  There were no flashing lights or bells.




caught fire.  A bunch of people were hurt.  More were shaken 
up.


I&#x27;m assuming their construction trucks don&#x27;t trigger the &quot;short the 
rails together to signal various things&quot; logic, either.  This would 
mean that crossing arms stay up... and I have to assume it also means 
the signals along the way stay green instead of going red.

We will presumably hear more about whatever the signals said, and 
whether the train went past a red signal or not.  I just have a bad 
feeling that they saw a green and kept on going.</p>

                  <p>Here&#x27;s a little bit of Silicon Valley local flavor for a change.  We 
have this freeway that runs from San Jose to San Francisco called US 
101, or around here, just &quot;101&quot;.  (Southern California has it too, but 
they call it &quot;the&quot; 101.  That&#x27;s how we detect invaders.)  Anyway, this 
thing is usually eight or more lanes up and down the peninsula, and it&#x27;s 
had a &quot;diamond&quot; or car pool lane on the #1 (innermost/&quot;fast&quot;) lane for 
many years.  You had to have a certain number of people in the car (or 
some other conditions met) during certain hours (AM and PM rush, 
weekdays), or you&#x27;d be in for a hefty ticket.


How does the system know what to charge you?  Well, you either have an 
old-style toll transponder that always bills you as a solo driver, or 
you have a new-style transponder with a 1/2/3+ switch that tells the 
road how to handle you.


Think about what this does to enforcement.  Now, instead of just &quot;is 
there a vehicle in the lane&quot;, &quot;is it the right time during a weekday&quot;, 
and &quot;how many people are in the car&quot;, now it&#x27;s also a matter of &quot;do they 
have their transponder set properly&quot;.


Check this out.

                  <p>I already told a
story
about how you can hose your machine by pointing the Linux kernel at a 
custom core dump handler and then have that handler fail to function.  
This&#x27;ll clog up the pipe (really), and then everything else will just 
stack up behind it.  Pretty soon, every crashing process will be stuck 
just the same.


Once upon a time, in a big company environment, someone decided that 
they wanted to provide a service to other things running on the same 
Linux box.  But, instead of either writing Yet Another Service (tm) 
that would go through release processes and all of that good stuff, they 
went for a different design entirely.


There are so many problems with this.  You have the issue of a &quot;server&quot;

                  <p>If a web site makes an RSS or Atom feed available, it&#x27;s not a bad idea 
to poll it from time to time.  Actually doing that poll like a good 
netizen (remember that concept?) takes a little attention to detail.


Given the reality of the situation, does it make sense to poll every 10 
seconds?  Probably not, right?  Someone set up something like that and 
left it running for a couple of months until I finally noticed it and 
dealt with it myself.


Given this, you can keep track of the &quot;Last-Modified&quot; header when you 
get a copy of the feed.  Then, you can turn around and use that same 
value in an &quot;If-Modified-Since&quot; header the next time you come to look 
for an update.  If nothing&#x27;s changed, the web server will notice it&#x27;s 
the same as what it already has, and it&#x27;ll send you a HTTP 304 co‚Ä¶</p>

                  <p>Here&#x27;s a concept: &quot;ssh to prod and edit directly on the machine&quot; is 
generally bad news.


I should point out that I didn&#x27;t know this person and had no idea how 
they would respond to such feedback - it might have been fine!  They 
might be a well-adjusted person who can take a request like that and not 
turn it around into a full-on nuclear attack.  But, I didn&#x27;t know either 
way.


At some point, I actually had a meeting with this developer for some 
other reason, and what happened was kind of amazing.  First thing, he 
brought it up and asked me about it.  I said something like, &quot;well, I 
didn&#x27;t want to get into it, but since you asked&quot;, and proceeded into 
something along the lines of &quot;obviously it would be best if you didn&#x27;t 
do that - sshing in and twiddling Python files on the actual production 
AWS instance of the service&quot;.


&quot;But... I suspect you are doing it for some reason?&quot;


My response was... I hope... reasonable: &quot;So as much as I would love to 
say &#x27;don&#x27;t do that!!!&#x27;, I&#x27;m not going to stand in the way of you 
literally doing your job.  So please proceed with care, and keep an eye 
open for some day when (first dumb thing) and (second dumb thing) aren&#x27;t 
problems any more and you need not do this any more.&quot;


It was either &quot;edit in prod&quot; or endure DAY LONG development cycles: make 
a change, wait 24 hours, come back tomorrow, and try it again.  That&#x27;s 
how broken it was.


The best part about this was that we had a totally reasonable 
conversation about it.  It&#x27;s the kind of thing which had become a rare 
commodity in those days at that place.


Would I expect someone else to go to that level of insanity every single 
time they just want to get their job done?  Absolutely not.

Editing files in prod to develop them?  That&#x27;s bad news.  Deliberately 
rigging tunnels to spoof a connection from prod?  That&#x27;s also bad news.  
Having to do them to get your job done?  You might be in the bad place.</p>

                  <p>Quite a while back, I wrote a post that basically went like this: if 
someone has a problem with someone else or something that person is 
doing, they&#x27;re going to find a way to get to &quot;no&quot;.  They will find some 
reason, some excuse, or some problem with it.  They&#x27;ll bring up a point 
and you&#x27;ll show that this is not in fact a thing.  They will then pivot 
again and again.


But, as I said, that was back then, and this time I&#x27;m talking about 
something else: when it happens in person with a coworker.  I had an 
experience like this a few years back, and figured I&#x27;d share how it goes 
for the sake of others who might not have encountered it yet, or who 
have and thought they were alone in this.

                  <p>This is a short one since it&#x27;s somewhere between a random bit of 
&quot;grab some popcorn&quot; amusement and a &quot;huh, that might be a problem some 
day&quot;.  In short, it looks like every Raspberry Pi filesystem installed 
from any given release image probably ends up with the same
UUID.


For instance, if you downloaded the &quot;lite&quot; version of Raspbian between 
roughly November 8th and January 28th, you probably got a file called 
2021-10-30-raspios-bullseye-armhf-lite.zip.  Inside, there&#x27;s an image, 
and the idea is that you dump that straight to your SD card, cram it in 
the Pi, and off you go.  The second partition on that image is an ext4 
filesystem which was created on some build machine somewhere.  The UUID 
on it never gets &quot;evolved&quot; to something else after the install.


You can see it inside the image itself here:


Or, if you actually installed a few of these things like I did over the 
past couple of months, you can just &#x27;tune2fs -l /dev/mmcblk0p2&#x27; and see 
the same value in there.


Don&#x27;t end up with a pile of SD cards on your desk and think &quot;I know, 
I&#x27;ll use the filesystem UUIDs to track which one goes where&quot;, in other 
words.


If it&#x27;s not breaking anything for you, it&#x27;s probably best to just let it 
be.  Untangling a boot mess on these weird little boxes is anything but 
fun.

Note: if you&#x27;re actually on a recent Raspberry Pi, odds are good that 
your /etc/fstab will be using *partition* UUIDs (PARTUUID&#x3D;...) and not 
those of the filesystem.  If in doubt, use blkid to see what&#x27;s what.</p>

                  <p>There are some interesting implications to the way that you have to 
handle references to other bits of code when you write a C++ header 
file.  There are things you can do which turn out to be suboptimal, and 
until or unless you work someplace with a coding style document or get 
some mentor who&#x27;s already been there, you&#x27;re likely to make some
mistakes.


Anyway, a common way to do this is to set up the outer class such that 
it has a pointer to the inner one.  You *could* have it just own it 
directly, but then that introduces problems.

  Bar bar_;



Of course, bar.h probably has its own dependencies which get #included, 
and so now you end up with this evil web of slow compiles.  It sucks.


What used to happen next is that someone would say, okay, let&#x27;s make it

                  <p>Yesterday, I
put forth
a bunch of API possibilities for the problem of needing to return a 
value but also indicating the lack of a value and being able to comment 
on why.  In it, the notion of a &quot;wrapper&quot; around a string was presented, 
such that it might look like &quot;Result&quot;, and those brackets 
started looking like a pain.  There was also the possibility of having 
something like &quot;ResultString&quot;, but didn&#x27;t that open the door to having a 
bunch of code duplication?


After this had existed for a while, the general happy feeling of having 
this stuff in place became infectious.  I wanted it to cover other 
things with it, too.  I wanted it to handle something a bit more 
complicated than a mere string, and so decided to try my hand at the

                  <p>If you agree with the notion that you need to be able to tell the 
difference between the absence of a value and a value itself, then this 
has some impacts on the code you write.  If you want to keep &#x27;em 
separated (so they can come out and play), then it gets you looking at 
your API designs in certain ways.


Imagine we&#x27;re talking about a helper function that is intended to be run 
inside a program that&#x27;s handling the access to a web page.  It&#x27;s 
probably a CGI program, but it could also be buried inside some much 
bigger thing, too.  This is all about C++ styles, but you can probably 
see slices of other languages in here, too.

I mentioned taking my old Mac Mini out of the OS X/macos ecosystem and 
bringing it into Debian, and then what kind of hilarity followed when I 
attempted to install a Javascript linter (and it tried to drag in 180+ 
node-related packages).

do they ever really think about the implications of having hundreds of 
teeny little libraries, all moving independently?  This is how it 
manifests in the real world.


My relative inexperience with Debian systems means I&#x27;m constantly being 
delighted to discover that such and such has already been packaged up 
and is just an apt command away.  Things that I would have done by hand 
in the years up to this point now have someone else worrying about them.

literal characters &quot;HTTP&quot; as a number
has expanded.  Now it has a variant: 4740180.


Where does this one come from?  
Go and gRPC, apparently!


I found this while searching the web for &quot;1213486160&quot; to see how things 
have been going in the past few years.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s still biting 
people all over the place.  There are far too many posts asking people 
to upgrade their software, or restart things, or do any number of 
useless rubber-chicken-waving techniques which ultimately will 
accomplish nothing.

When you see a funny-looking number, figure out where it comes from.
That&#x27;s the only way to have any chance of understanding what&#x27;s actually 
going on.</p>

&quot;process infection&quot; story:

https://lwn.net/Articles/883547/):


If you do privileged execution of specific operations via IPC you get 
the guarantee that whatever is done, is done from a well-defined, 
pristine execution environment, without leaking context implicitly. The 
IPC message is the *full* vulnerable surface, and that&#x27;s as minimal as 
it can get. And that&#x27;s great.




Oh wow, thank you for mentioning that, unnamed reader!  I definitely 
read that post on LWN at some point in the past couple of days when the 
pkexec thing started going around.  It must have really worked its way 
into my head, and then eventually stirred up the memory of everything

                  <p>I once worked at a place that had an interesting little problem stemming 
from the way they managed machines and some of the fun side-effects 
processes can have on each other.  This is back in the pre-systemd days 
of running services, such that things tended to be started or restarted 
by someone or something that itself ran as root.  That is, if you 
started something, it might inherit one or more things from your 
environment.  Likewise, if you ran something with an unusual 
environment, it might bestow those &quot;gifts&quot; onto anything it happened to 
touch.


After locking themselves out of machines too many times, people 
generally learned that after you mess with a glibc upgrade, you restart 
the sshd listener on port 22.  Of course, they also had to learn to not

in a post all by itself to give it a chance to &quot;sink in&quot; before I went 
and used it in an analogy.  First, I&#x27;ll just show the image and explain 
what you&#x27;re looking at here.




I do remember the description from the back: this is a picture of *part 
of* something that was called the Software Creations BBS.  It was a 
multi-line bulletin board system where you could dial up and send 
messages to people, upload and download files, and (presumably) play 
online games (&quot;doors&quot;) and anything else they cared to offer.

64 machines in a little space.  I have to assume 
they are at least 
286s (ATs, more or 
less), but it&#x27;s impossible to tell from just this picture.  They could 
have been 386s or even 486s by that point, but ‚Ä¶</p>

                  <p>Okay, so yesterday I 
posted
a picture of an old multi-line bulletin board system which had 
apparently taken over an entire bedroom with dozens of computers.  I 
mentioned that I intended to come back to the topic to throw in my own 
two cents, and so here we go.


Or, were you someone who found it horrific and wished there was a 
simpler way?  Did you wonder if it would be possible to pack all of that 
into one or maybe two boxes, instead?  Did you want a way to negate all 
of that complexity while still providing the same level of service?


Now, things are different.  I look at that and just sigh at the lost 
opportunities.  The actual amount of work being done on behalf of any of 
the users who are connected is tiny.  If we ignore the fact that the
