                  <p>Based on an analysis of leaked PIN numbers by Nick Berry, Information is Beautiful made this visualization of the most common PINs.

According to the analysis, just 20 4-digit numbers account for 27% of all PINs: 1234, 0000, 7777, 2000, 2222, 9999, 5555, 1122, 8888, 2001, 1111, 1212, 1004, 4444, 6969 (nice), 3333, 6666, 1313, 4321, 1010. The diagonal line is people using repeated pairs of digits (e.g. 2727 or 8888) while the horizontal line near the bottom is people who are presumably using their (19xx) birth year as a PIN. (You can see the beginning of a 20xx line on the left side.)
The best causally unguessable PINs would seem to be unrepeated pairs of numbers greater than 50 ‚Äî so 8957, 7064, 9653, etc. Choose wisely.

                  <p>San Francisco‚Äôs Arion Press still uses decades-old machines to make beautiful books by hand. They‚Äôre one of the few remaining presses in the world that do everything from start to finish ‚Äî they even cast their own type. 
Arion dwells in an almost extinct corner of the book world: Call it Slow Publishing. It produces only three books a year, each a unique art object reproduced in editions of less than 300. Art is so important, in fact, that the illustrators-art-world luminaries-drive the title selection process.
‚ÄúWe learned that the projects went a lot more smoothly when we said to the artist, ‚ÄòWhat do you want to do?‚Äô‚Äù Blythe said.


Anthony Bourdain visited Arion in 2015 for a online series called Raw Craft ‚Äî it‚Äôs a great look at how and why they produce books this way:

Business Insider‚Äôs Still Standing series recently profiled Arion as well:

                  <p>The Gyermekvas√∫t (Children‚Äôs Railway) is a 7-mile-long rail line in Budapest that‚Äôs operated by children aged 10-14 (aside from the train‚Äôs driver).
Children‚Äôs Railway, Budapest is one of Budapest‚Äôs most unique attractions. Like any other railway, it has ticket offices, diesel locomotives, signals, switches and a timetable. Unlike other railways though, this one is run by children. The line stretches among the Buda hills from Sz√©chenyihegy to H≈±v√∂sv√∂lgy, crossing the Cogwheel Railway and serving Normafa as well as the highest point of Budapest: J√°noshegy.


The project, then called the Pioneer‚Äôs Railway, was started in 1947 as a part of a three-year Communist plan. This video shows how the railway operates and includes interviews with current workers as well as former workers from the Communist era:

Seems like all the kids are big train nerds‚Ä¶adorable.

                  <p>Kurzgesagt is back with another video about black holes; it has the innocuous-seeming title of The Easiest Way To Build a Black Hole. But the main topic of the video is the speculation that universes (like ours!) might exist within black holes.
Black holes might create infinite universes while destroying time and space. Everything in existence could be black holes, all the way down. We might live inside a black hole that is inside a black hole, that is inside a black hole. But let‚Äôs start at the beginning and build a black hole out of air.


This one is a bit of a brain-bender. From the show notes:
The first part of the script is based on the empirical fact that, somewhat intriguingly, the observable universe seems to have the exact size and mass that would be required to make a black hole as big as the observable universe itself.
The second, completely independent proposal we explore is the idea that our Universe could be born from the singularity of a black hole, and that in turn the universe that contains that black hole could be born from a black hole itself. If so, universes in later generations of this process could be better fitted to produce an abundance of black holes, in a sort of ‚Äúnatural selection‚Äù towards efficient black hole production.

Update: Bold claim by Robin Sloan on Twitter:
The calm density of this video is way more ‚Äúfuture of visual communication‚Äù than 99% of claimants to that title


I agree. That video contained more information than a 44-minute episode of Mythbusters but the pace and energy were more relaxed.

                  <p>Jon Stewart is back on The Daily Show on a regular basis and the other day he took on the manufactured outrage that is cancel culture.
Nothing about the right wing reaction is surprising because the idea that there is an all pervasive, all powerful threat to free speech called cancel culture has become a central tenet of modern conservatism. They celebrate their being silenced at conferences. They celebrate their being silenced on podcasts and streaming outlets. They celebrate their being silenced with over 700 book titles about being canceled. Why are there so many of these fucking books?
Conservatives have an entire industry devoted to complaining about not being allowed to say the things they say all the time. Their victimhood is the entire brand.


And:
We are not censored or silenced. We are surrounded by and inundated with more speech than has ever existed in the history of communication.

                  <p>This is such a wild story. Two men, Thomas James Cobden-Sanderson &amp; Emery Walker, founded the Doves Press in London in 1900. They made a typeface called Doves Roman:
During its short life early last century, the Doves Press printed and bound some of the finest books ever produced in England and its approach to typography and printing subsequently exerted a major influence over book design in Europe and the United States. Many of Cobden-Sanderson‚Äôs ideas would, decades later, find expression or adaptation in both Traditionalist and Modernist circles respectively.


The partnership busted up and Cobden-Sanderson eventually took all of the lead type and dumped it in the Thames River. No more typeface.

Website technology is becoming increasingly complex and energy intensive, with big companies like Meta and Google leading the dance. ‚ÄãIs this necessary? What does it really take to get our content online?
‚ÄãLow‚Üêtech Magazine &amp; Antoine Jaunard are teaming up to bring you a low-tech website making workshop. ‚ÄãIt takes place in Barcelona, at Akasha Hub, on 25 May from 3 to 6 pm.
‚ÄãTogether, we will demystify web technologies by making websites that are simple to create and modify. Websites that can be hosted anywhere, even on a DIY solar powered server.
The workshop will be in English or Spanish depending on you. Come as you are. And just bring your computer.

                  <p>I just started a rewatch of Chernobyl and was struck by the opening lines of the first episode spoken by Jared Harris, who plays Soviet nuclear physicist Valery Legasov:
What is the cost of lies? It‚Äôs not that we‚Äôll mistake them for the truth. The real danger is that if we hear enough lies, then we no longer recognize the truth at all. What can we do then? What else is left but to abandon even the hope of truth and content ourselves instead with stories? In these stories, it doesn‚Äôt matter who the heroes are. All we want to know is: Who is to blame?

I don‚Äôt know how to tell you this‚Ä¶but your father has murdered people before. There are bodies in the ground. ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know what she‚Äôs so upset about. It‚Äôs a victimless crime. Nobody‚Äôs gonna miss that fry. Nobody‚Äôs gonna miss THAT KID!‚Äô

                  <p>The Great Wave off Kanagawa by Katsushika Hokusai is one of the world‚Äôs most iconic pieces of art. Hokusai created the woodblock print in 1831 at the age of 71 as part of his series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji. But in some sense, he‚Äôd been working on it all of his life.
In 1797, at the age of 37, Hokusai made what could be interpreted as his first wave print, Spring at Enoshima (Enoshima shunb√¥):

Hokusai made his next attempt in 1803 (age 43) with View of Honmoku off Kanagawa (Kanagawa-oki Honmoku no zu):

Two years later in 1805 (age 45) came Express Delivery Boats Rowing through Waves (Oshiokuri hat√¥ ts√ªsen no zu) and it‚Äôs starting to look familiar:

A few waves show up in Hokusai‚Äôs three-volume Quick Lessons in Simplified Drawing (1812).

                  <p>From Business Insider‚Äôs series Still Standing, a look at La Maison du Pastel, a 300-year-old French company that makes pastels for artists by hand. Back in its golden age, the company supplied the likes of Monet &amp; Degas but fell into neglect near the end of the 20th century. The newest generation of ownership has restored the company and they now offer over 1,900 different pastel colors.
Seriously, take a look at their online shop‚Ä¶there‚Äôs all sorts of amazing stuff in there. Like this antique watercolors set ‚Äî get a load of these color names: Violet Lake, Burnt Lake, Carmine, Venice Red, Vermilion, Orange Chrome, Gamboge, Zinc White, Yellow Ochre, Burnt Umber, Van Dyck Brown, Lamp Black, Payne‚Äôs Gray, Indigo, Celestial Blue, Blue Ash, Prussian. You can even order a full set of their pastels for only ‚Ç¨29,450.00 (the set comes with a custom-made chest of drawers).
I am not at all an artist but these colors all look so amazing that I‚Äôm eyeing one of the smaller sets for myself‚Ä¶ (thx, caroline)

                  <p>Queendom is a documentary film by Agniia Galdanova about queer Russian activist and performance artist Jenna Marvin and her unusual form of protest against the war in Ukraine and Russia‚Äôs treatment of LGBTQ+ people. From a short review in the Guardian:
When Russia invaded Ukraine in February last year, some brave souls took to the streets of Moscow to voice their horror at the war, and were met with batons and police brutality. Radical queer performance artist Gena Marvin took a different approach. Wearing platform boots, body paint and wrapped in barbed wire, she walked the streets of Moscow in a stark, silent statement against the war. To call Gena a drag artist fails to capture just how subversive and courageous are her public ‚Äúperformances‚Äù. Her otherworldly costumes, created from junk and tape, show the influence of Leigh Bowery; her fearlessness evokes the punk provocation of Pussy Riot.


Marvin‚Äôs performances can be intense ‚Äî check out this video from Pars in 2022. France had just advanced into the semifinals of the World Cup and she went out on the streets dressed in an all-black costume straight out of Alien or Pan‚Äôs Labyrinth:

Queendom opens in theaters and will available on streaming on June 14.

For me, listening to the banter was just as entertaining as watching the riding ‚Äî it‚Äôs obvious they‚Äôre just out there having a blast.
P.S. I was also trying to calculate how fast I would die if I tried riding some of that stuff and the answer is ‚Äúalmost immediately‚Äù. Yiiiikes.

                  <p>The other day while singing to my daughter, I realized that I can, in fact, sing better than I used to. I think the sheer amount of ‚ÄúWheels on the Bus‚Äù and ‚ÄúRow, Row, Row Your Boat‚Äù did the trick: I enjoy it more now and feel like I‚Äôm hitting more of the right notes. I‚Äôm still not ‚Äúgood,‚Äù but I‚Äôm not bad, and I‚Äôm less embarrassed to be caught singing in front of other people. It reminds me of the Terry Gross detail that she took voice lessons not to become a better singer but simply so she could sing along more pleasurably to music she loved. 
Has anyone else been singing anything fun lately? For their kids, or in any other situation? I‚Äôve been singing a lot of Carrie Anne, by The Hollies.

I tried to push through it ‚Äì until, suddenly, neither my body nor my brain could find a reason to carry on. I slowed to a walk. I stopped my watch. I sat down and had a little cry, the sweat drying on my back. Then I walked home.


The essays remind me of a concept called Positive Addiction (and a 1985 book of the same name) ‚Äî the idea that it‚Äôs possible to be truly addicted to things that are good for you. I‚Äôm an almost-daily runner, and I do understand how it could be described as addiction, although for now I just love it. Maybe a key is that I don‚Äôt run especially long distances. And it‚Äôs a relatively new habit. But I guess there‚Äôs (hopefully) still plenty of time for it to sour.

                  <p>Can we emulate the upcoming CSS contrast-color() function via CSS features that have already widely shipped?
And if so, what are the tradeoffs involved and how to best balance them?
Relative Colors
Out of all the CSS features I have designed,
Relative Colors aka Relative Color Syntax (RCS) is definitely among the ones I‚Äôm most proud of.
In a nutshell, they allow CSS authors to derive a new color from an existing color value by doing arbitrary math on color components
in any supported color space:
--color-lighter: hsl(from var(--color) h s calc(l * 1.2));
--color-lighterer: oklch(from var(--color) calc(l + 0.2) c h);
--color-alpha-50: oklab(from var(--color) l a b / 50%);

The elevator pitch was that by allowing lower level operations they provide authors flexibility on how to derive color ‚Ä¶</p>

                  <p>You may have heard that this year, for the first time since 1803, two different broods of cicadas will emerge at the same time.
This year, though, will be a rare event. Two groups, or ‚Äúbroods,‚Äù are waking up during the same season. There will likely be billions, if not trillions, of the insects.
There‚Äôs the 17-year-group called Brood XIII, which is concentrated in northern Illinois (brown on the map below), and the 13-year clutch, Brood XIX, which will emerge in southern Illinois, Missouri, Arkansas, and throughout the Southeast.


You may have noticed the lengths of both periodicities (13, 17) are prime numbers ‚Äî and that does not appear to be a coincidence. Scientists haven‚Äôt nailed down an exact cause, but one hypothesis has to do with predator cycles:

                  <p>I am apparently one of the few people who really liked the first season of the Lord of the Rings prequel series, The Rings of Power. I mean, it had its rough spots and maybe there was a little too much table-setting, but in general it left me wanting to see what was going to happen next. The trailer for season two just dropped and it looks pretty action-packed and stocked with characters &amp; events that would be familiar to those who have read the main book series. Here‚Äôs the synopsis:
Sauron has returned. Cast out by Galadriel, without army or ally, the rising Dark Lord must now rely on his own cunning to rebuild his strength and oversee the creation of the Rings of Power, which will allow him to bind all the peoples of Middle-earth to his sinister will. Building on Season One‚Äôs epic scope and ambition, the new season plunges even its most beloved and vulnerable characters into a rising tide of darkness, challenging each to find their place in a world that is increasingly on the brink of calamity. Elves and dwarves, orcs and men, wizards and Harfoots‚Ä¶ as friendships are strained and kingdoms begin to fracture, the forces of good will struggle ever more valiantly to hold on to what matters to them most of all‚Ä¶ each other.


And they also released a behind-the-scenes look at the production of season two:

The second season of The Rings of Power premieres on August 29 on Amazon Prime.

The end began like this: One evening, after the last game of the high-school season, I asked my son if he‚Äôd be trying out for spring league. For a youth-hockey kid, playing spring league is the equivalent of a minor-league pitcher playing winter ball in Mexico ‚Äî so necessary as a statement of intent and means of improvement that forgoing it is like giving up ‚Äúthe path.‚Äù Rather than a simple affirmative nod, as I‚Äôd expected, I got these words: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to think about it.‚Äù Think about it?

                  <p>Thanks to the Instagram account New American Paintings, I recently came across the work of Los Angeles-based artist Delia Brown, including the above portrait, ‚ÄúJai Maa! (Justine II),‚Äù which I love. A feature on Brown in Independent Art Fair magazine also includes an awesome painting of hers from 2000 called ‚ÄúWhat, Are You Jealous?‚Äù (probably NSFW).
Someday ‚Äî someday! ‚Äî I want to turn down an invitation to something because ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt, I‚Äôm sitting for my portrait at that time.‚Äù
Elsewhere in portraits: King Charles‚Äôs, by Jonathan Yeo. ‚ÄúIn his interview with the BBC,‚Äù the NYT‚Äôs Vanessa Friedman writes, ‚ÄúMr. Yeo noted that when the king first saw the painting, he was ‚Äòinitially mildly surprised by the strong color,‚Äô which may be an understatement.‚Äù
Many more of Brown‚Äôs paintings can be found on her website and Instagram.

                  <p>Francis Ford Coppola has been making Megalopolis since 1983 and has self funded it ‚Äúin part by the sale of a significant portion of the director‚Äôs wine empire‚Äù. But the trailer is finally here and it premieres at Cannes in two days‚Äô time. Here‚Äôs a synopsis shared by Coppola himself:
A man balances precariously on a ledge high above a once-grand city in the opening scene of Francis Ford Coppola‚Äôs MEGALOPOLIS, and the movie that follows is ‚Äî at least in part ‚Äî about an entire civilization teetering on a similarly precarious ledge, devouring itself in a whirl of unchecked greed, self-absorption, and political propaganda, while a few bold dreamers push against the tide, striving to usher in a new dawn. The man is called Caesar (Adam Driver), like the Roman general who gave rise to the Roman Em‚Ä¶</p>

                  <p>Hey folks. I‚Äôve posted a couple of times about Hot Frank Summer, the group read of Mary Shelley‚Äôs Frankenstein (1831 edition) that some folks are doing on Bluesky. Well, it kicks off today. To participate, all you need to do is follow the reading schedule. If you don‚Äôt have a copy of the book yet, check out this free ebook version by Standard Ebooks ‚Äî they even have a web version you can read on your phone or tablet (or Vision Pro, I guess?). 
If you‚Äôd also like to discuss the book (and/or follow along with others discussing the book), there‚Äôs this feed on Bluesky. I found this little tidbit on the feed:
Frankenstein takes place in the mid-1790s and Moby Dick may take place as early as 1830, so it‚Äôs possible Captain Walton sailed with a young Ahab.


Someone needs to write that little crossover prequel.
Anyway, you can also use this comment thread as a place to discuss the book. I‚Äôm not sure how well it will work, but we can give it a try? I‚Äôd suggest not discussing anything ahead of the day‚Äôs reading, but other than that, let ‚Äòer rip!

                  <p>Osita Nwanevu on the recent US campus protests:
The student left is the most reliably correct constituency in America. Over the past 60 years, it has passed every great moral test American foreign policy has forced upon the public, including the Vietnam war, the question of relations with apartheid South Africa, and the Iraq war. Student activists were at the heart of the black civil rights movement from the very beginning. To much derision and abuse, they pushed for more rights, protections and respect for women and queer people on their campuses than the wider world was long willing to provide. And over the past 20 years in particular, policymakers have arrived belatedly to stances on economic inequality, climate change, drug policy and criminal justice that putative radicals on campus took up long before them.
They have not always been right; even when right, their prescriptions for the problems they‚Äôve identified and their means of directing attention to them have not always been prudent. But time and time and time again, the student left in America has squarely faced and expressed truths our politicians and all the eminent and eloquent voices of moderation in the press, in all of their supposed wisdom and good sense, have been unable or unwilling to see. Straining against an ancient and immortal prejudice against youth, it has made a habit of telling the American people, in tones that discomfit, what they need to hear before they are ready to hear it.

                  <p>Oh man, I screwed up big-time you guys and owe you an apology. The great Erik Larson (The Devil in the White City, The Splendid and the Vile, In the Garden of Beasts) came out with a new book two weeks ago and I somehow missed it! I almost shrieked when I saw it on the bookstore front table yesterday.
Anyway, the book is called The Demon of Unrest: A Saga of Hubris, Heartbreak, and Heroism at the Dawn of the Civil War (bookshop.org). Here‚Äôs the synopsis:
On November 6, 1860, Abraham Lincoln became the fluky victor in a tight race for president. The country was bitterly at odds; Southern extremists were moving ever closer to destroying the Union, with one state after another seceding and Lincoln powerless to stop them. Slavery fueled the conflict, but somehow the passions of North and South‚Ä¶</p>

                  <p>There was a big solar storm this weekend and photos of the aurora borealis took over social media; it was delightful. For round-ups, check out the NY Times, the Guardian, @itsjackcohen, PBS NewsHour, Spaceweather.com, Forbes, and MSN.
The photos above are by Albert Dros and Sean O‚Äô Riordan (prints here). O‚Äô Riordan took his shot in Tasmania and actually had to tone it down for publication:
When the clouds are glowing red you know something is off the charts, I tried my best to desaturate this and make it look some bit like a photo and not a science fiction scene!

                  <p>Using the Barbie movie and other media (movies, TV shows) as a guide, Pop Culture Detective delves into what ‚Äúpatriarchy‚Äù actually means (mirrors: Patreon &amp; archive.org).
We‚Äôre going to use the movie as a sort of primer to help explain what patriarchy actually is, what it isn‚Äôt, and how it ends up harming everyone, including men. To have any kind of productive conversation, we have to get over that defensiveness that so many men feel whenever they they come across the word ‚Äúpatriarchy‚Äù. Contrary to popular belief, patriarchy is not a synonym for men, nor is it a code word for masculinity, and it certainly has nothing to do with hating men.


The bibliography in the description of the video lists three books if you‚Äôd like to do some reading on the topic:
The Gender Knot: Unraveling Our Patriarchal Legacy by Allan G Johnson.
The Will to Change: Men, Masculinity, and Love by bell hooks.
Masculinities by R. W. Connell.


(via waxy)
P.S. While I was watching this video, YouTube removed it after Warner Brothers ‚Äúblocked it on copyright grounds‚Äù. The channel is challenging the takedown and has uploaded it to Patreon and archive.org in the meantime. (I‚Äôm leaving the embed in case it comes back to life.) This bullshit is so irritating ‚Äî Google just totally letting massive media corporations decide what‚Äôs copyright infringing without recourse. And Warner (and Gerwig &amp; Robbie too to some lesser extent)‚Ä¶you made the fucking movie to get a message across and to get people talking and someone posts a thoughtful video essay about the central issue of the film and you fucking take it down?

                  <p>NASA used one of their supercomputers to model what it would look like if you flew into a supermassive black hole. (You can watch the simulation in a 360¬∞ view on YouTube. I bet it looks great on a VR rig like Apple Vision Pro.)
The movies begin with the camera located nearly 400 million miles (640 million kilometers) away, with the black hole quickly filling the view. Along the way, the black hole‚Äôs disk, photon rings, and the night sky become increasingly distorted ‚Äî and even form multiple images as their light traverses the increasingly warped space-time.
In real time, the camera takes about 3 hours to fall to the event horizon, executing almost two complete 30-minute orbits along the way. But to anyone observing from afar, it would never quite get there. As space-time becomes ever more distorted closer to the horizon, the image of the camera would slow and then seem to freeze just shy of it. This is why astronomers originally referred to black holes as ‚Äúfrozen stars.‚Äù
At the event horizon, even space-time itself flows inward at the speed of light, the cosmic speed limit. Once inside it, both the camera and the space-time in which it‚Äôs moving rush toward the black hole‚Äôs center ‚Äî a one-dimensional point called a singularity, where the laws of physics as we know them cease to operate.
‚ÄúOnce the camera crosses the horizon, its destruction by spaghettification is just 12.8 seconds away,‚Äù Schnittman said. From there, it‚Äôs only 79,500 miles (128,000 kilometers) to the singularity. This final leg of the voyage is over in the blink of an eye.

                  <p>If you play carefully by not stomping enemies, not collecting coins, not eating mushrooms or flowers, and hopping on the flagpole at the very last second, you can rescue the princess in Super Mario Bros with only 500 points.

One bit is surprisingly tricky:
How tough is that jump in 8-1? Well, the timing of the liftoff, the duration of holding the jump button, and the timing of the wall jump are all frame perfect. NES games run at 60 frames per second, which means all the necessary inputs need to be timed within 1/60 of a second. In addition, the starting position before running I used not only has to be on the right pixel, but also the x sub-pixel has to fall within a certain range (technical stuff blah blah blah). In short, it‚Äôs a pretty annoying jump.


When I was a kid, I left my NES on for three straight days to flip the score in SMB, using the 1UP trick and another spot in the game to get many lives and points. Scoring lower would have been a lot quicker.

                  <p>choral music playlist the other day, with the preceding lines as an intro, and the idea of a ‚Äúlast instrument‚Äù was pleasingly creepy to me. It also reminded me of the above video, of artist Maria Coman singing the ‚ÄúLove is patient, love is kind‚Äù lines from the First Epistle to the Corinthians, from the Bible. (1 Corinthians 13: 1-8.) More of Coman‚Äôs music can be found on her website. And what is that church she‚Äôs in?

                  <p>The Greatest Life Hacks in the World (For Now).‚Äù It was mostly a tribute to Kevin Kelly‚Äôs famous life advice posts, but Brooks added one of his own, and  I‚Äôve thought of at least once a week since: 
‚Ä¶over the last few years I have embraced, almost as a religious mantra, the idea that if you‚Äôre not sure you can carry it all, take two trips.


Take two trips. Nothing serious, but of all the ‚Äúlife advice‚Äù posts I‚Äôve read, this is the one that‚Äôs changed my own life the most. Anyone else have something from an advice list that really made it into their brains/lives?
The closest thing to a life advice aphorism I‚Äôve ever come up with is maybe too gross to write down. And it‚Äôs running-themed, so it could be too specific. But maybe if I share it here, I will exorcise it from my brain: Sometimes you‚Äôre so worried about pooping your pants that you don‚Äôt realize you‚Äôve already pooped your pants.

                  <p>As someone who reads almost exclusively on an ereader (a Kindle Paperwhite), I have been intrigued by Craig Mod‚Äôs recent evangelism of the BOOX Palma, a pocket-sized e-ink device that he‚Äôs been using as an ereader. In the latest issue of his Roden newsletter, he explains why he likes it so much:
Once you hold a Palma, you realize that for most situations it‚Äôs an ideal reading container. On the train? In line? In the waiting room at the doctor‚Äôs office? I‚Äôve carried my Palma with me every day for the past three or so months with the goal of reaching for it rather than my iPhone. I call it the Gentle Librarian. Soft screen, clean interface, no SIM card and so mostly no internet (it loads up with new articles while at home on Wi-Fi; I can always tether to my phone to update or add something new to read on the go), a refresh rate that is plausible enough on which to watch movies (!! hypnotizing, actually, like watching a magic trick, like what Victorians may have imagined ‚Äúcomputer screens‚Äù to look like) but not really responsive enough to seduce you into installing social media apps. There‚Äôs a lot of friction in this little bugger, and it turns out a bit of friction is a good friend of the kind of reading we love.


Hmm. Hmm! Like Mod, I‚Äôm frustrated with Amazon‚Äôs lack of vision and activity on the ereader front and lament the time I spend on my Casino Rectangle / Dingdong Casino of Hell. Maybe I‚Äôll try the Palma out‚Ä¶

                  <p>I love these (haunting? are they haunting?) photos of Cate Blanchett taken by Jack Davison for this 2022 profile in the NY Times Magazine.
When the magazine asked the photographer Jack Davison to create the art for this story, he took inspiration from Cate Blanchett‚Äôs legendary gift at transforming herself on film. Over the course of a four-hour shoot, across nine different setups, Davison made the fantastical, perspective-bending portraits that appear here.

Politicians and marketers now use data and targeted advertising to try to change our behaviors and influence our worldviews. But why should these tools only be available to people in places like Washington DC, Manhattan and London?

                  <p>Ana Tudor, as always, shows excellent methods to create (what I&#x27;d call) retro print effects to images using CSS.
This is something I&#x27;ve typically turned to PhotoShop to (struggle) with, but Ana shows how this can be done with CSS.
In Ana&#x27;s CodePens, SCSS is used, but even the compiled CSS is relatively easy to follow.

                  <p>Zo√´ Schlanger‚Äôs new book (out today) sounds really interesting: The Light Eaters: How the Unseen World of Plant Intelligence Offers a New Understanding of Life on Earth (Bookshop.org).
It takes tremendous biological creativity to be a plant. To survive and thrive while rooted in a single spot, plants have adapted ingenious methods of survival. In recent years, scientists have learned about their ability to communicate, recognize their kin and behave socially, hear sounds, morph their bodies to blend into their surroundings, store useful memories that inform their life cycle, and trick animals into behaving to their benefit, to name just a few remarkable talents.


I heard about it from NPR‚Äôs Fresh Air ‚Äî check out this completely metal behavior:
Schlanger notes that some tomato plants, when being eaten by caterpillars, fill their leaves with a chemical that makes them so unappetizing that the caterpillars start eating each other instead. Corn plants have been known to sample the saliva of predator caterpillars ‚Äî and then use that information to emit a chemical to attract a parasitic wasp that will attack the caterpillar.
Schlanger acknowledges that our understanding of plants is still developing ‚Äî as are the definitions of ‚Äúintelligence‚Äù and ‚Äúconsciousness.‚Äù ‚ÄúScience is there [for] observation and to experiment, but it can‚Äôt answer questions about this ineffable, squishy concept of intelligence and consciousness,‚Äù she says.

                  <p>Do you remember the Broccoli Tree? Photographer Patrik Svedberg photographed a Swedish tree that resembled a broccoli floret over a number of years, posted the results to Instagram, and made the tree internet famous. Then some asshole vandal sawed through the branches of the tree and it had to be chopped down. John Green eulogized the Broccoli Tree in a video:
To share something is to risk losing it, especially in a world where sharing occurs at tremendous scale and where everyone seems to want to be noticed, even if only for cutting down a beloved tree.


Well, the stump of the tree was left in the hopes that it would grow again and I‚Äôm pleased to say that it has ‚Äî here‚Äôs a photo from three years ago:

You can even see it on Google Maps. I‚Äôm glad the tree is growing again but wish the destruction hadn‚Äôt happened in the first place.

                  <p>In honor of novelist C.J. Sansom‚Äôs passing, I wanted to recommend his marvelous Matthew Shardlake historical crime thrillers, for anyone who isn‚Äôt already familiar. I definitely learned and remembered more about Thomas Cromwell-era England from Dissolution than I did from any textbooks (not that I‚Äôve read any of those in a while, but still). It was all very visceral in a damp-stone-monastery, heavy cloaks, burning candles, teeth-being-pulled-in-the-Tower-of-London kind of way. Also his novels are just super fun, and the Matthew Shardlake character ‚Äî a sort of proto-detective lawyer ‚Äî is especially memorable.

                  <p>Gareth Fearn writing for the London Review of Books about the student protests on US campuses: Liberalism without Accountability.
This is a toxic combination: universities reliant on investment portfolios in a system where mega-profits are made by companies that threaten and destroy human life, influenced by an increasingly radicalised class of billionaires, teaching students whose degrees won‚Äôt earn them enough to pay off their loans, managed by supine administrators threatened by (or willingly collaborating with) a reactionary right, who have decided that young people‚Äôs minds are being turned against capitalism not by their own lived experience of austerity and racialised police violence but by ‚Äòwoke Marxist professors‚Äô. This situation has now met with a live-streamed genocide which is supported, and brazenly lied about, by political leaders and commentators who claim to stand for truth and justice. Students, like much of the public, cannot square the reality of what they see with the world as constructed by politicians and the media.
Under such circumstances, pitching tents, raising placards and demanding divestment are really quite mild-mannered responses. That they have been met, in many US universities, with militarised policing reflects the fragility of liberalism ‚Äî in the face of the growing hegemony of the conservative right as well as its own inability to offer a future even to Ivy League college students, let alone the less privileged.

                  <p>These folks wrote an autopilot in Javascript that can control planes in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 (via the API). ‚ÄúTo allay any concerns: this is not about running JavaScript software to control an actual aircraft. That would kill people.‚Äù

                  <p>I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen a skate video like this before: a group of riders skating the smooth, flowing rocks on the Maltese island of Gozo (site of Calypso‚Äôs cave in the Odyssey). Skateboarding has always been such an urban-coded sport ‚Äî surfing on concrete, reliant on the human-made infrastructure against which it rebels ‚Äî that it‚Äôs a little bit of a mindbend to see it out in nature like this.

                  <p>Recently, some of the items from the personal collection of the late artist Jason Polan were auctioned off. The NY Times wrote about the effort to preserve his legacy.
Jen Bekman, the founder of the online gallery 20x200, reflected on Mr. Polan‚Äôs legacy while she sat beside his sketches.
‚ÄúThese are not doodles,‚Äù Ms. Bekman said. ‚ÄúThat word is diminishing. People remember him as an illustrator, but Jason was a great artist, and his practice was his life.‚Äù


I ‚Äúlost‚Äù a bunch of time browsing through the collection this morning, which includes both work by Polan and things he collected &amp; received from other artists.




It‚Äôs great to see Polan‚Äôs legacy being preserved and his art being spread around the world. And to be reminded of that time he went to a fashion show.
I sort of stood still because I was a little confused as to what just happened. Kim walked right by me. Puff Daddy took a picture with someone right in front of me. I then saw Beyonc√© walking toward me and I said, ‚ÄúHi Beyonc√©,‚Äù and she said, ‚ÄúHeeey,‚Äù and smiled and it was kind of like having a Bar Mitzvah. Then Jay Z walked by and I said, ‚ÄúHi Jay,‚Äù and in the second I said that I thought, am I supposed to add a Z? but didn‚Äôt and he said hey but not as beautifully as Beyonc√©. I love her so much. I drew a couple more people and then went outside and forgot where I was and then walked to the train and went home.


Reminder: you can buy prints and things of Polan‚Äôs work at 20x200. I have several of these, including the Zoo Baggu, which I get compliments on almost every time I use it for grocery shopping.

                  <p>The trailer for Senna, a Netflix limited series about Brazilian F1 driver Ayrton Senna. Kinda skeptical about this, considering how great the documentary Senna (2010) is.

                  <p>The second issue of Road Snacks is out featuring an interview with Nashville-based singer/songwriter Jack Van Cleaf. I like his song Rattlesnake, maybe you will, too. Road Snacks is semi-regular interview series between an ice cream shop and a touring musician talking exclusively about food on tour. I have made it my mission to find out which snacky treats touring musicians live for.
Jack Van Cleaf: That‚Äôs the thing, when I get to the gas station, they only have the small bags. The price per pound ratio doesn‚Äôt appeal to me as much, but when I get those big bags from Costco, I don‚Äôt know, something about the endlessness of it. It really, really drives me.
Gracie‚Äôs: You get lost in the bottom of bag.
Jack Van Cleaf: I do, I do. Probably at the gas station I‚Äôm gonna go with a Reese‚Äôs Cup or a Take Five.
Gracie‚Äôs: Tell me anything else about food while touring?
Jack Van Cleaf: The gas station question has me thinking about Twist of Lime Hot Cheetos. Are you familiar with those?

                  <p>An officer ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù fired his weapon during an NYPD raid on a student-occupied building at Columbia University on Tuesday. Apparently, he mistook his gun for a flashlight. You may be wondering: how could this happen? Well, like this. From a 2014 article in the Denver Post:

Ronny Flanagan took pride in his record as a police officer in Plano, Texas. He had an incident-free career. He took safety training regularly. He was known at the range as a very good shot.
Yet he killed a man when he was simply trying to press a flashlight switch mounted beneath the trigger on his pistol.
In a deposition, Flanagan expressed his remorse and made a prediction.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want anyone to ever sit in a chair I‚Äôm in right now,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThink about the officers that aren‚Äôt as well trained, officers tha‚Ä¶</p>

                  <p>I enjoyed Ezra Klein‚Äôs podcast conversation with Nilay Patel, the editor of The Verge. They talked about media and AI mostly.
(First of all, anyone who says they‚Äôre trying to ‚Äúrevolutionize the media through blog posts‚Äù is a-ok in my book.)
Anyway, here‚Äôs Patel on the limitations of AI and where humans shine:
But these models in their most reductive essence are just statistical representations of the past. They are not great at new ideas.
And I think that the power of human beings sort of having new ideas all the time, that‚Äôs the thing that the platforms won‚Äôt be able to find. That‚Äôs why the platforms feel old. Social platforms like enter a decay state where everyone‚Äôs making the same thing all the time. It‚Äôs because we‚Äôve optimized for the distribution, and people get bored and that bored‚Ä¶</p>

                  <p>Nothing more exciting than knitted items! This isn‚Äôt news, but a relative sent it to me recently, and I see it also made the rounds on Reddit a few days ago. Here‚Äôs the gist, per the Rijksmuseum:
In 1980 archaeologists investigated the graves of 185 Dutchmen ‚Äî whale hunters, and workers at whale oil refineries ‚Äî who had died on or near Spitsbergen [an island in Norway‚Äôs Svalbard archipelago] in the 17th century. Many skeletons were still wearing their knitted woollen head coverings. These caps were highly personal. The men were bundled up against the severe cold and could only be recognized by the colours and patterns of their caps. Presumably this is the reason why the caps went with them into their graves.


The hats look remarkably modern, especially if you zoom in. And in fact here are some modern caps, called Deadman Hats, inspired by the old ones. (More info and context for the Dutch hats can be found in this 2016 post from the blog A Bluestocking Knits.)
And this is maybe tangential, but it reminds me of an 18th-century kerfuffle I read about once, in which the young poet Thomas Chatterton claimed to have discovered a 15th-century poem, until a reference within the poem ‚Äî to knitting ‚Äî gave it away as contemporary, and presumably as written by Chatterton himself. Or that‚Äôs how I remember it, anyway ‚Ä¶ Although it looks like subsequent research places the advent of knitting earlier than believed at the time. 
Even more tangential, to the above tangent: The smoking-gun reference to knitting doesn‚Äôt seem to actually appear in the poem, at least not as I‚Äôm currently finding it. (??) (The reference: ‚ÄúShe sayde as her whyte hondes whyte hosen was knyttinge, Whatte pleasure ytt ys to be married!‚Äù) ‚Ä¶ Actually, I think I‚Äôm in over my head. ‚Ä¶ The ‚Äúhistory of knitting‚Äù Wikipedia page also generally confirms this impression (of being in over my head).

                  <p>Year of Bach, it often includes more Bach than I can handle, but in a good way, and I like letting it wash over me. 
Yesterday‚Äôs installment was more of a primer ‚Äî I mean it was literally labeled ‚ÄúWhere to start with Bach‚Äù and ‚Äúa primer for new listeners‚Äù ‚Äî which was especially up my alley.  
Through this project, I‚Äôm attempting to write for the masses about a niche topic, which embeds the danger of writing for no one. So today I want to recognize my readers who are in earlier stages of their Bach journeys, and in this post I‚Äôll be recommending some of the grassier pathways into this music.
Of the tracks and musicians he linked to, my favorite is the Yo-Yo Ma, Chris Thile, and Edgar Meyer rendition of Bach‚Äôs Trio Sonata No. 6 in G Major (above), from their Bach Trios album of 2017. I also loved Brad Mehldau‚Äôs Prelude No. 3 in C Major from The Well-Tempered Clavier Book I, which Goldfine describes as ‚Äúdamned perfect, a one track playlist on repeat forever.‚Äù

                  <p>Since the early 70s, the Native Youth Olympics have showcased the traditional games of the Alaska Native people:
Our Alaska Native ancestors developed traditional games in order to test and prove crucial abilities that governed everyday life. Competition was created with each other to hone their ability to hunt and fish for daily survival in the traditional way of life. The creators of the NYO Games wanted an opportunity to demonstrate their favorite traditional Native contests of their forefathers.


I found out about this via a highlight reel on Instagram ‚Äî here‚Äôs last year‚Äôs competition highlights:

You can check out a list of the competitive events; they include:
One-foot High Kick: ‚ÄúIn many cultures, the One-Foot High Kick was used for signaling a successful hunt.‚Äù
Indian Stick Pull: ‚ÄúThe Indian Stick Pull represents grabbing a slippery salmon, and was used traditionally to develop hand and arm strength.‚Äù



Kneel Jump: ‚ÄúHistorically, the Kneel Jump was a game used to strengthen the leg muscles for jumping from ice floe to ice floe, and for lifting prey after a successful hunt.‚Äù



Seal Hop: ‚ÄúThe Seal Hop is a variation of the Inuit Knuckle Hop, and used traditionally as a game of endurance and stamina, and for sneaking up on a seal, mimicking the mammal‚Äôs movement on the ice.‚Äù



Two-foot High Kick: ‚ÄúThe Two-Foot High Kick was historically used to communicate the success of a spring hunt.‚Äù

I love these events. I think my favorite is a reintroduced event for the 2024 games (just concluded): the Toe Kick, which returned after a 10-year hiatus. Here‚Äôs how you do it:

Here‚Äôs a short documentary about the NYO and athlete Autumn Ridley from 2013 ‚Äî her event is the Alaskan High Kick, perhaps the most impressively athletic event:

Like this sliding door that sounds like R2-D2 screaming. Or the falling shovel that plays Smells Like Teen Spirit. Or the door that can do a wicked Miles Davis impression. Or the nightstand door that sounds like Chewbacca. I even found one of my own a few months ago: the elevator door at the old Buzzfeed office sounded like Chewbacca as well. (via @williamlubelski)
Update: Here‚Äôs a video full of things that sound like Chewbacca.

                  <p>Hey everyone!
This is the list of all the changes we&#x27;ve done to our projects during the month of April.
Summary Of Changes
100r.co, added Twilight, updated our notes on chainplates, wheel to tiller conversion, cabin lights standing rigging replacement, Princess Louisa Inlet(added maps), Goji no Chaimu(added maps), and Sailing to Japan(fixed some dead links).
Hakum, released a new comic sequence called Kaizah.
Wunderland Rabbits, released a new Rabbit travel photo
Orca, added a note on the repository for the Javascript version titled Is Orca dead?
Devine has been busy working on the implementation and documentation of wryl&#x27;s fantastic programming language Modal. Rewriting systems are a computation paradigm that is generally unknown and under-explored that might have some fascinating features that might be able help us to tackle some of our future projects.
In other news, Pino is ready to head northward! We finished all of our boats projects and left the dock on May 1st. See a photo of our first day of the year on the water, taken as we exited Enterprise Channel, just north of Trial Island south of Victoria. On our travels we will continue to push updates every month like usual, but the updates will only go live when we find internet, and this may or may not coincide with the start of every month. We will keep a log of our travels, populated with plenty of drawings!
Pino book &amp; movie club
Book Club: This month we are reading The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand.

                  <p>These bubblegum sculptures created and photographed by artist Suzanne Saroff are delightfully disgusting.



I found this via Grace Ebert at Colossal, who writes:
Conjuring memories of childhood competitions and absent-minded chomping, the photos zoom in on chewed wads of pink, blue, and green that appear almost corporeal, their pudgy folds and pockets evoking the beauty and repulsion of the human body.


I love these but grrrrossssss. (And I don‚Äôt know why, but these remind me of Roe Ethridge‚Äôs photo of Andrew W.K.)

                  <p>Oh wow, this takes me right back to my childhood: Electronic Plastic, a museum of portable, old-school electronic toys. We didn‚Äôt have a gaming system in my house growing up ‚Äî I had to settle going over to my friend Steve‚Äôs house for Atari 2600 and my big city cousins‚Äô Intellivision ‚Äî but we did have a couple of these handheld games. Specifically: Baseball (upper right), Football 2 (lower left), and Q*bert (lower right). The football game was my favorite. I played it for hours and hours ‚Äî so many touchdowns. (And look at these Soviet handhelds!)
Friends at school had other games: I particularly remember the watches, some of the mini arcade cabinets from Coleco, and these pre-Game Boy Nintendo handhelds. The teachers hated them‚Ä¶I think they probably got banned at some point.
I know that my dad still has these games stashed somewhere in the house I grew up in‚Ä¶I‚Äôd love to play Football 2 again. ü§ñüèà (via present and correct)

                  <p>Whenever Beauford Delaney‚Äôs Portrait of Howard Swanson (1967) pops up in MoMA‚Äôs New Tab extension in Chrome, I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúJerry Seinfeld?!‚Äù
There are a number of celebrities who have art doppelg√§ngers ‚Äî the Robert De Niro and John Krasinski ones are particularly good. Have you noticed any of these?

                  <p>Data artist Robert Hodgin recently created a feedback loop between Midjourney and ChatGPT-4 ‚Äî he prompted MJ to create an image of an old man in a messy room wearing a VR headset, asked ChatGPT to describe the image, then fed that description back into MJ to generate another image, and did that 10 times. Here was the first image:

And here‚Äôs one of the last images:

Recursive art like this has a long history ‚Äî see Alvin Lucier‚Äôs I Am Sitting in a Room from 1969 ‚Äî but Hodgin‚Äôs project also hints at the challenges facing AI companies seeking to keep their training data free of material created by AI. Ted Chiang has encouraged us to ‚Äúthink of ChatGPT as a blurry jpeg of all the text on the Web‚Äù:
It retains much of the information on the Web, in the same way that a jpeg retains much of the information of a higher-resolution image, but, if you‚Äôre looking for an exact sequence of bits, you won‚Äôt find it; all you will ever get is an approximation. But, because the approximation is presented in the form of grammatical text, which ChatGPT excels at creating, it‚Äôs usually acceptable. You‚Äôre still looking at a blurry jpeg, but the blurriness occurs in a way that doesn‚Äôt make the picture as a whole look less sharp.


And we already know what you get if you recursively save JPEGs‚Ä¶

Tell me what it‚Äôs like to live without

You can read the rest at Tin House.
From Lacy M. Johnson in Orion Magazine, The Brutal Legacy of the Longleaf Pine:
The oldest longleaf pine tree in the world, I remember, is a nameless tree in Weymouth Woods in North Carolina. It is roughly 474 years old, taking root around the time Michelangelo took over construction of the dome of St. Peter‚Äôs Basilica, fifty-nine years before European colonizers arrived at Jamestown. In 2016, when the tree turned 468, visitors to the North Carolina State Parks system held a ‚ÄúParty for the Pine.‚Äù They celebrated by hiking to the tree, cutting cake, singing it ‚ÄúHappy Birthday.‚Äù

                  <p>Edith here. For the latest installment of my newish illustrated column, I interviewed my friend and neighbor, the artist and climate activist Zaria Forman. Zaria makes pastel drawings of ice, among other things, and her solo show ‚ÄúFellsfjara, Iceland‚Äù is currently on exhibition at Winston W√§chter gallery in New York until May 4. (I‚Äôve rendered a miniature version of some of it right below these words, but definitely click here for the actual images.) Zaria is also on Instagram. 



Zaria, have you read, watched, listened to, or otherwise experienced anything good recently?
Poor Things. It was so visually stimulating and imaginative ‚Äî more than anything I‚Äôve seen in a while.

Possibly more interesting: the ice storm a few weekends ago! I‚Äôd never seen an ice storm before moving to upstate Ne‚Ä¶</p>

                  <p>TV critic James Poniewozik writing for the NY Times:
Mid TV, on the other hand, almost can‚Äôt be bad for some of the same reasons that keep it from being great. It‚Äôs often an echo of the last generation of breakthrough TV (so the highs and lows of ‚ÄúGame of Thrones‚Äù are succeeded by the faithful adequacy of ‚ÄúHouse of the Dragon‚Äù). Or it‚Äôs made by professionals who know how to make TV too well, and therefore miss a prerequisite of making great art, which is training yourself to forget how the thing was ever done and thus coming up with your own way of doing it.
Mid is not a strict genre with a universal definition. But it‚Äôs what you get when you raise TV‚Äôs production values and lower its ambitions. It reminds you a little of something you once liked a lot. It substitutes great casting for gre‚Ä¶</p>

                  <p>This is a nice thing to end the week on: Yo-Yo Ma playing ‚ÄúBach‚Äôs Pr√©lude from Suite No. 2, amidst the melting permafrost on Lower Tanana Dene lands in Fairbanks, Alaska.‚Äù He was brought to this birch forest by Princess Daazhraii Johnson, a member of the Neets‚Äôaii Gwich‚Äôin people, who wrote:
Our relationship to our birch relatives, our salmon relatives, and all the beings of Alaska are sacred. Our traditional stories tell us that at one point we all spoke the same language ‚Ä¶ we still do. If we find the time to truly listen, we might recognize ourselves in the melting permafrost or the fallen birch, but we might also recognize ourselves in the songs of the birds or the freshness of the Arctic breeze. There is still hope when we experience life. We should all fall in love with the places we live and let this love drive our determination to protect the waters, the salmon, the caribou, and all our plant relatives so that future generations may also experience such joy and sustenance.


Have a good weekend, everyone.

                  <p>Yesss, Run Lola Run is returning to theaters for its 25th anniversary. A 4K digital restoration will start showing on June 7. I loved this movie ‚Äî saw it in the theater when it came out but haven‚Äôt seen it in many years.

                  <p>This is great: a 25-minute interview with legendary animator Chuck Jones as he sits and draws some of his iconic characters (Bugs Bunny, Porky Pig, Daffy Duck). He told this anecdote about how Steven Spielberg and George Lucas were both influenced by a particular space-themed cartoon of his:
Porky was just a kind of a little third-string Boy Scout and was not very interesting to me. And then when I put him in a picture called Duck Dodgers in the 24th and a Half Century. Spielberg used that picture in Close Encounters the Third Kind - when his kids were watching television in the picture, they were watching Duck Dodgers in the 24th and a Half Century. And Lucas told me that he saw that picture when he was 12 years old and when when he opened Star Wars in San Francisco he told them they couldn‚Äôt have Star Wars in San Francisco unless they ran Duck Dodgers in the 24th and a Half Century.

                  <p>The other day, the novelist Robin Sloan mentioned in his newsletter that he really liked the Financial Times. It seems everyone‚Äôs talking up the Financial Times lately, so I went and followed them on Instagram. 
The first post in their feed was for an essay by Janan Ganesh, about how although the American self-help industry makes it seems like most mistakes can be salvaged, many are in fact unsalvageable and life-destroying. An excerpt: 
The sur¬≠prise of middle age, and the ter¬≠ror of it, is how much of a per¬≠son‚Äôs fate can boil down to one mis¬≠judge¬≠ment.
Such as? What in par¬≠tic¬≠u¬≠lar should the young know? If you marry badly ‚Äî or marry at all, when it isn‚Äôt for you ‚Äî don‚Äôt assume the dam¬≠age is recov¬≠er¬≠able. If you make the wrong career choice, and real¬≠ise it as early as age 30, don‚Äôt count on a way back. ‚Ä¶ A big [mistake], or just an early one, can fore¬≠close all hope of the life you wanted.


At first I found it oddly cheering (if I can‚Äôt fix my mistakes, I might as well relax and accept my circumstances), but then I found it sad. (Does my husband feel like he made a life-destroying mistake by marrying me? LMAO.) Now I‚Äôm more like ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø because things can only ever go the way they go. Anyway, I‚Äôm not yet a FT subscriber, but it was a nudge.

                  <p>Here is a pleasantly painful trailer for a new movie from the filmmaker Joanna Arnow. It opens this Friday, April 26, at IFC and Lincoln Center in NYC. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm going to watch it, but I couldn‚Äôt really look away. 
Arnow also stars as‚Ä¶ 
an emotionally detached young Brooklynite drifting through unremarkable days and nights. Neither her on-again-off-again BDSM relationship with a mildly disinterested older dom, nor her nondescript corporate job, appear to bring her any satisfaction.


And yet ‚Äúshe finds a core of poignant truth about the ways people search for ‚Ä¶ emotional happiness and sexual gratification‚Äù (per the Lincoln Center summary). It‚Äôs currently at a 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, FWIW. (This bit also made me laugh out loud.)

                  <p>I think knitters are often fascinated by the fact that I use such tiny needles. Some of the needles are almost the dimension of a human hair.


Sublimely absurd, perfection. More info in Reactor. [Thanks, Tobias!]
And here‚Äôs another pic, grabbed from Crome‚Äôs website: 

I don‚Äôt know about you, but this makes me want to drop everything and disappear into the process of knitting a microscopic sweater for the next six months. Like her Starry Night one. 
Actually, the Starry Night sweater should just be its whole own post: 

‚ÄúI love the paradox of creating an object that takes the form of something you can wear,‚Äù Crome writes, ‚Äúyet is impossible to wear.‚Äù 
(Her work is also for sale.)

                  <p>I love this: The Pudding ran an online experiment where they started with a shape (like a straight line or circle) and asked people to trace, as best they could, the tracing of the person before them. This resulted in a series of ‚Äúflipbook‚Äù animation of how the shapes evolved over time ‚Äî invariably, a squiggle.

One thing I noticed right away was how all the squiggles ended up squished over on the right side of the screen. The Pudding team had a theory on why that happened (the 3:20 mark in this video):
I found this study from like 35 years ago - they were trying to figure out why people kept missing their targets on touch screens. They found people tended to touch below their target and people tended to touch closer to the edges of the screen. And so I figure if it‚Äôs like right-handers who are missing, you‚Äôre going to be missing to the right. We probably had about half the users on mobile and 90% of the those half are probably going to be right-handed so it would make sense that it would gradually go to the right.


Go read the rest of the post ‚Äî they also did an experiment about people‚Äôs inclination to draw penises on ‚Äúany free-form drawing project on the internet‚Äù. (via waxy)

                  <p>As someone who is interested in birds but doesn‚Äôt know a whole lot about them, this new animated video series from Will Rose is right up my alley. What Bird Is That? is a beginners guide to birding. The second episode, embedded above, is all about how to identify birds from their calls.
What‚Äôs that bird that sounds like Star Wars singing on my roof? What bird sings it‚Äôs own name? What‚Äôs that laughing sound you heard in the woods?


Right now, I ‚Äúcheat‚Äù by using Cornell Lab of Ornithology‚Äôs eBird app, which allows you to record a bit of birdsong and it‚Äôll ID the bird for you. (via the kid should see this)

                  <p>How teens benefit from having the choice to read ‚Äúdisturbing‚Äù books. They reported being more empathetic, thoughtful, happier, and better readers. I read a lot of ‚Äúage-inappropriate‚Äù stuff as a preteen &amp; teen (Stephen King, etc.) and it was fine.

This day in history: 2009, 2014, 2019,¬†2023 Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I&#x27;ve been. Latest books: You keep readin&#x27; em, I&#x27;ll keep writin&#x27; &#x27;em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I&#x27;ll keep writin&#x27; &#x27;em. Colophon: All the rest. Antitrust is a labor issue (permalink) This is huge: yesterday, the FTC finalized a rule banning noncompete agreements for every American worker. That means that the person working the register at a Wendy&#x27;s can switch to the fry-trap at McD&#x27;s for an extra $0.25/hour, without their boss suing them: https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/04/ftc-announces-rule-banning-noncompetes ‚Ä¶</p>

                  <p>Steve Mould‚Äôs videos are always entertaining and informative but this one is also a little bit mind-blowing. If you build a circular trough with just the right dimensions and fill it with lighter fluid, a flame will travel around it. And other shapes will do other things ‚Äî the effect created by the star/octopus shape is especially cool. The effect is an example of an excitable medium:
An excitable medium is a nonlinear dynamical system which has the capacity to propagate a wave of some description, and which cannot support the passing of another wave until a certain amount of time has passed (known as the refractory time).
A forest is an example of an excitable medium: if a wildfire burns through the forest, no fire can return to a burnt spot until the vegetation has gone through its refractory period and regrown.


Other examples:
Normal and pathological activities in the heart and brain can be modelled as excitable media. A group of spectators at a sporting event are an excitable medium, as can be observed in a Mexican wave (so-called from its initial appearance in the 1986 World Cup in Mexico).

                  <p>In the spirit of recommending things I truly love, I wanted to highlight the pottery of Northern California artist Naja Tepe. I‚Äôve ordered from her twice now, and her work is fabulous. I love her strawberry-themed items, but the crescent moon on the plate in her most recent Instagram post (upper right in the composite above) made me want to have everything it appears on, too. Great for gifts. I don‚Äôt think my mom reads this site, so I will therefore reveal that I got her a Naja Tepe item for her birthday this year.

                  <p>Ok mountain bike nerds, I need your advice. Here‚Äôs my situation: I‚Äôve been riding for 3.5 years now on a Kona Honzo hardtail (which I really love) and am pondering a full-suspension bike purchase. They are $$$, but I want to do more riding this summer &amp; fall ‚Äî including some downhilling on some local lift-serviced trails here in VT (Bolton, Killington, Sugarbush, Burke) ‚Äî and it feels like it‚Äôs the right time to invest in an upgrade.
I would say I‚Äôm an intermediate rider (but more towards the beginner end of the spectrum than the expert end). I love flowy trails and can do small jumps and such, but I‚Äôm not super fast and am still learning how to turn properly in the berms. I‚Äôm never going to be a super aggressive rider but I‚Äôd like to progress. A lot of the stuff I ride is up and down, so I need something that climbs well (not looking for a downhill bike). I‚Äôm 6‚Äô and 155# if that matters. My Honzo is a large and has 29‚Äù wheels, which I like. I‚Äôve ridden a Kona Process 153 29 and that felt good, although maybe a little squishy (but maybe everything feels squishy after a hardtail).
There are good bike shops around here and I‚Äôm definitely going to talk to them about what I‚Äôm looking for, but I‚Äôm wondering if anyone out there has thoughts about brands (particularly those that are known for quality (and ones that aren‚Äôt)), what to look for, what to stay away from, etc. Should I buy used? If so, good places to buy used? (I know about Pinkbike.) Any help or advice is appreciated, either in the comments below or via email. Thanks!

                  <p>Letterboxd asked Dune director Denis Villeneuve what his four favorite films were and he cheated and listed five (including 2001 and Blade Runner).
First of all, who knows how long Blade Runner has been on his top 5 (or even 10 or 20 list) but getting to do a sequel of one of your favorite films has to be unbelievably rewarding as a director.1
And I‚Äôm going to cheat as well here and list a number of other films that Villeneuve has publicly praised, courtesy of this piece from IndieWire: Vertigo, Children of Men, Downsizing (?), There Will Be Blood, Seven Samurai, The Beguiled, Jaws, and three Nolan films (Dunkirk, Inception, Tenet).

I was trying to think of what might be the equivalent to this for me and all I could come up with is getting hired to reboot Suck or something.‚Ü©

                  <p>Hey there everyone. As I quickly touched on over the weekend, I launched a few new tweaks/features for the comments here on kottke.org:
1. Ability to edit comments. After you post a new comment, you‚Äôve got 10 minutes to edit it ‚Äî to fix any typos, formatting slip-ups, or quick extra thoughts. After 10 minutes, the comment is locked. Edited comments are denoted by some text (‚ÄúEdited‚Äù) next to the timestamp of the comment and you can click on it to see the comment‚Äôs original text.
2. A (hopefully) less confusing posting interface. I still haven‚Äôt totally dialed this in, but the inline reply box wasn‚Äôt working, particularly when you tried replying to the last comment in a thread and then you had Dueling Comment Textareas but only one was the One True Textarea ‚Äî chaos. Now everything (posting,‚Ä¶</p>

                  <p>This weekend I was doing some programming work (comments, another small project) and listening to some old-school electronica (DJ-Kicks by Kruder &amp; Dorfmeister anyone?). When I write, I tend to listen to chill stuff so I can concentrate ‚Äî classical, vaporwave, soundtracks, Jon Hopkins, Sigur R√≥s, Tycho, Boards of Canada, things like that ‚Äî but when designing or programming, I need something faster with a beat to spur me onwards.
So anyway, I was about to switch from electronica to something by kottke.org favorites The Hood Internet when I thought to check their website to see if they‚Äôd released any new mixtapes. And lo ‚Äî they had (sorta). The Lost Mixtape is a 45-minute mix of music from circa 2005-2009, discovered on some dusty old hard drive and recently finished up &amp; released for our listening pleasure.

The bit at around 16:00 where they mix Milkshake and So Electric is just superb. You can find streaming options and a downloadable MP3 on their website.

                  <p>Really fascinating piece by Michael Habib in Scientific American about how amazing feathers are: they come in so many different shapes and sizes and do so many things (insulate, keep dry, flying, noise dampening, etc. etc. etc.) And I loved the opening anecdote:
In October 2022 a bird with the code name B6 set a new world record that few people outside the field of ornithology noticed. Over the course of 11 days, B6, a young Bar-tailed Godwit, flew from its hatching ground in Alaska to its wintering ground in Tasmania, covering 8,425 miles without taking a single break. For comparison, there is only one commercial aircraft that can fly that far nonstop, a Boeing 777 with a 213-foot wingspan and one of the most powerful jet engines in the world. During its journey, B6-an animal that could perch comfortably on your shoulder-did not land, did not eat, did not drink and did not stop flapping, sustaining an average ground speed of 30 miles per hour 24 hours a day as it winged its way to the other end of the world.
Many factors contributed to this astonishing feat of athleticism-muscle power, a high metabolic rate and a physiological tolerance for elevated cortisol levels, among other things. B6‚Äôs odyssey is also a triumph of the remarkable mechanical properties of some of the most easily recognized yet enigmatic structures in the biological world: feathers. Feathers kept B6 warm overnight while it flew above the Pacific Ocean. Feathers repelled rain along the way. Feathers formed the flight surfaces of the wings that kept B6 aloft and drove the bird forward for nearly 250 hours without failing.

                  <p>[Voiceover]: The Nautilus had no heat or insulation ‚Äî nothing but bare metal separated them from the frigid Arctic waters. The crew were constantly sickened with food poisoning and dosed with lead from the soldering in the submarine‚Äôs pipes. Attempting the pole this late in the season would be extremely dangerous, and without exception everyone wanted to turn around and head home. Everyone except Wilkins.

I ‚Äúenjoyed‚Äù this stressful mini-documentary, from the Mustard Channel, about the ill-fated (but ‚Äî spoiler? ‚Äî not THAT ill-fated) 1931 attempt to reach the North Pole by submarine. [via The Browser]

                  <p>I‚Äôve been thinking about something I posted last week ‚Äî in an excerpt from his new book The Work of Art, former New York magazine editor Adam Moss described the art he makes as bad: ‚ÄúWhen I left my job, I began to paint more seriously,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúThat was the beginning of my torment: I just wasn‚Äôt very good.‚Äù Or as he put it to The New Yorker: ‚ÄúI kind of just wasn‚Äôt any good.‚Äù Or to Vanity Fair: ‚ÄúI really wanted to be a good painter. What a fucking idiot I was.‚Äù Or on NPR, ‚ÄúI really wanted to be good, and it made the act of making art so frustrating for me.‚Äù
The book is mostly about how other artists make their work, but I‚Äôm currently more interested in what Moss has to say about himself and his art. 
Later in the VF and NPR interviews, Moss says that the main lesson he learned from making the book is that with art, it‚Äôs the journey not the destination ‚Äî or, ‚Äúthe making, not the made‚Äù (‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the most banal observation‚Äù) ‚Äî but of course I still went looking for his paintings online. I want to see them! I didn‚Äôt find anything (per the VF article, he hasn‚Äôt shared anything publicly yet), but to Moss I say: Show them! Maybe it doesn‚Äôt matter if they‚Äôre not good. Maybe the worse, the better.

                  <p>A family of beavers in Canada has built a dam that‚Äôs twice as wide as the Hoover Dam. This huge dam is kind of a click-baity promotion (it worked!) but the essence of the video is how beavers can help make landscapes more resilient to effects of climate change.
It‚Äôs so big it can be seen from outer space. But that‚Äôs not the only reason NASA is interested in this architecturally minded species‚Ä¶ Increasing diversity and resilience, not to mention creating wetlands, are just some of the impacts beavers can have on their surroundings. What does this mean for the wider environment? And how can we humans learn from it?

                  <p>Several years ago in the Guardian, Oliver Burkeman wrote a piece called This column will change your life: Helsinki Bus Station Theory. It‚Äôs about how difficult it can be as a creative person to find your way to making work that feels like it‚Äôs uniquely yours.
There are two dozen platforms, Minkkinen explains, from each of which several different bus lines depart. Thereafter, for a kilometre or more, all the lines leaving from any one platform take the same route out of the city, making identical stops. ‚ÄúEach bus stop represents one year in the life of a photographer,‚Äù Minkkinen says. You pick a career direction ‚Äî maybe you focus on making platinum prints of nudes ‚Äî and set off. Three stops later, you‚Äôve got a nascent body of work. ‚ÄúYou take those three years of work on the nude to [a gallery], and the curator asks if you are familiar with the nudes of Irving Penn.‚Äù Penn‚Äôs bus, it turns out, was on the same route. Annoyed to have been following someone else‚Äôs path, ‚Äúyou hop off the bus, grab a cab‚Ä¶ and head straight back to the bus station, looking for another platform‚Äù. Three years later, something similar happens. ‚ÄúThis goes on all your creative life: always showing new work, always being compared to others.‚Äù What‚Äôs the answer? ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs simple. Stay on the bus. Stay on the fucking bus.‚Äù

                  <p>Edith here. For the next installment of my newish illustrated column here on Kottke dot org, I talked to my friend Nick Catucci. Nick edits the excellent newsletter Embedded, which partially inspired me to start this column. (Specifically, Embedded has an interview series called My Internet that I‚Äôve always loved.) Nick is also site director at GQ. And about 13 years ago the two of us worked at Vulture together.
Hey Nick! Have you read (watched, listened to, or otherwise experienced) anything good recently?
I think I speak for my demographic when I say that the new Waxahatchee album, Tigers Blood, is a dream. My friends at Pitchfork published a great profile of Katie by Andy Cush where she‚Äôs really insightful about how, being sober, she‚Äôs drawing from a different well than heroes of hers l‚Ä¶</p>

                  <p>This is a teenager is an interactive data visualization by Alvin Chang about a group of American teenagers that have been tracked in a longitudinal study since 1997 (they are around 40 years old now). The video version of the visualization is embedded above.
A year from now, in 1998, a researcher named Vincent Felitti will publish a paper that drastically changes the way we think about these kids ‚Äî and their childhood.
The research will show that these childhood stressors and traumas ‚Äî called Adverse Childhood Experiences ‚Äî have a lifelong effect on our health, relationships, happiness, financial security, and pretty much everything else that we value. It will kickstart decades of research that shows that our childhood experiences shape our adulthood far more than we ever thought.


This is a good companion to a recent post, End-Stage Poverty Is Killing People in Safety Net-Free America.

I often talk about what a missed opportunity it is that mainstream digital art tools are so caught up in making the perfect pencil line, or imitating exactly how chalk or water colors work, when there&#x27;s other types of lines we can invent that would never be able to exist in the real world.</p>

                  <p>The homicide rate continues to plummet in major American cities. ‚ÄúThe nation is on track to see one of the lowest levels of violent crimes and homicides since President Obama was in office.‚Äù

                  <p>Picture this. You‚Äôve joined a squad at your company that‚Äôs designing new product features with an emphasis on automation or AI. Or your company has just implemented a personalization engine. Either way, you‚Äôre designing with data. Now what? When it comes to designing for personalization, there are many cautionary tales, no overnight successes, and few guides for the perplexed.¬†
Between the fantasy of getting it right and the fear of it going wrong‚Äîlike when we encounter ‚Äúpersofails‚Äù in the vein of a company repeatedly imploring everyday consumers to buy additional toilet seats‚Äîthe personalization gap is real. It‚Äôs an especially confounding place to be a digital professional without a map, a compass, or a plan.

                  <p>From Factory Monster (great name), a video of how candles are made in a South Korean candle factory. I like that there‚Äôs no music or voiceover, so you can hear the sounds of the production. I also enjoyed the charmingly janky English subtitles:
Blah blah powder for hardness. Yellow powder for pure white color. Irony, huh?!


Can someone who knows something about making candles tell me why that hole is made in each of the candles with the metal rods? It was unclear from the video what its purpose is.
If you‚Äôd like to ruin/enhance the rest of your day, Factory Monster has a trove of making-of videos shot in Korean factories and workshops: retreading old tires, distressed jeans, chain link fences, customized Vans sneakers, and making a knife from an old motorcycle chain.

In 1973, a group of scientists witnessed the longest ever total solar eclipse by flying in the shadow (umbra) of the moon in a Concorde prototype for 74 minutes over the Sahara desert. From the abstract of a paper in Nature about the flight:
On June 30, 1973, Concorde 001 intercepted the path of a solar eclipse over North Africa, Flying at Mach 2.05 the aircraft provided seven observers from France, Britain and the United States with 74 min of totality bounded by extended second (7 min) and third (12 min) contacts.

                  <p>I‚Äôd missed that Philip Glass Solo (previously) came out in January, but I‚Äôve been listening to it while I work this morning and it‚Äôs just lovely. He recorded the album in his home on his piano. Here‚Äôs a short video of Glass playing on that very piano:

This is my piano, the instrument on which most of the music was written. It‚Äôs also the same room where I have worked for decades in the middle of the energy which New York City itself has brought to me. The listener may hear the quiet hum of New York in the background or feel the influence of time and memory that this space affords. To the degree possible, I made this record to invite the listener in.


And here‚Äôs a video of him playing the album‚Äôs opening piece on his 87th birthday:

You can stream the album on Spotify, Apple Music, or Bandcamp.

You can buy the album at Bandcamp or on vinyl at Amazon.

                  <p>In honor of Jane Goodall‚Äôs 90th birthday, Vital Impacts organized a fundraiser selling 90 prints from 90 women photographers. The collection includes some of Goodall‚Äôs own work and 60% of the proceeds to the Jane Goodall Institute.
I‚Äôve selected a few of my favorites above ‚Äî photos by (from top to bottom) Hannah Le Leu, Jane Goodall, Tiina Itkonen, and Luisa D√∂rr (see also Female Bolivian Skateboarders Shred in Traditional Dress). (via colossal)

                  <p>When emperor penguin chicks go for their first swim, they usually jump a few feet into the sea. The group of chicks in the video National Geographic video above decided to leap off of a 50-foot ice cliff for their first trip out.
It‚Äôs not unusual for emperor penguin chicks to march toward the ocean at a young age, even when they‚Äôre just 6 months old. They jump just 2 feet off the ice to take their first swim, according to National Geographic. 
Others have jumped from a much a higher altitude, heading to ‚Äúsheer ice cliffs‚Äù knowingly to make the first jump. Satellites have recorded the death-defying jumps since 2009, but what happens next has remained a mystery until now.


Having watched the video, ‚Äúleap‚Äù and ‚Äújump‚Äù are charitable descriptions of what the penguins are doing here. ‚ÄúFlop‚Äù, ‚Äúplop‚Äù, and ‚Äúfall‚Äù might be better‚Ä¶penguins are all kinds of cool, but no one has ever accused them of being graceful out of the water.

                  <p>Many Patients Don‚Äôt Survive End-Stage Poverty by Dr. Lindsay Ryan is a great/upsetting piece about how the poverty many Americans are subjected to in America is killing them. Many people die here in the world‚Äôs richest country not because they are sick but because they are poor and our systems of government, justice, business, and health care don‚Äôt do enough to help them (or, more cynically and perhaps truthfully, actively work against helping them).
This is one of those pieces where I want to quote every single paragraph, but I‚Äôll start with this one (bold mine):
Safety-net hospitals and clinics care for a population heavily skewed toward the poor, recent immigrants and people of color. The budgets of these places are forever tight. And anyone who works in them could tell you that illness‚Ä¶</p>

                  <p>You can‚Äôt make an omelette without cracking a few eggs, and when the core React team unveiled their vision for the future of React, some of my favourite libraries got scrambled üòÖ. In this blog post, we‚Äôre going to explore the compatibility issues between React Server Components and CSS-in-JS libraries like styled-components. You‚Äôll understand what the issue is, what the options are, and what‚Äôs on the horizon.</p>

                  <p>My current natural obsession is Mount Etna, a volcano in Sicily that blows perfect smoke rings like it‚Äôs frickin‚Äô Gandalf with a pipe-full of Old Toby or something.
It is a relatively rare phenomenon caused by a constant release of vapours and gases. The gaseous mass ascends rapidly through the central part of the conduit, promoting the formation of rings by wrapping the gas upon itself in a vortex motion.


Puff on, Etna, puff on.

                  <p>This is wonderful: a collection of video clips of Charles Schulz drawing his iconic Peanuts comic strip ‚Äî ‚Äúeverything I could find of Charles Schulz drawing his Peanuts characters‚Äù in the words of the compiler.
Unfortunately, I‚Äôm not highly educated. I‚Äôm merely a high school graduate. I studied art in a correspondence course because I was afraid to go to art school. I couldn‚Äôt see myself sitting in a room where everyone else in the room could draw much better than I and this way I was protected by drawing at home and simply mailing my drawings in and having them criticized.
I wish I had a better education but I think that my entire background made me well-suited for what I do. If I could write better than I can, perhaps I would have tried to become a novelist and I might have become a failure. If I could draw better than I can, I might have tried to become an illustrator or an artist and would have failed there. But my entire being seems to be just right for being a cartoonist.


Charles Schulz: Unbothered. Moisturized. Happy. In his lane. Focused. Flourishing.

                  <p>More of a TIL but my blog is rather bare lately, so this will do.
I was browsing the excellent MDN to check something and came across both Map.groupBy and Object.groupBy. A handy static method for keying an array by some property (I&#x27;ll show working example in a moment).
Pretty useful, but I quickly realised that I&#x27;m very much stuck in the camp of the old dog not quite learning the new tricks.</p>

And then I was wondering: What‚Äôs happening now that people living in the year 3200 will pity us for not understanding? ‚ÄúWow, can you imagine living back then and not knowing exactly how [viruses appear/cancer strikes/the Voynich Manuscript came into existence]?

                  <p>Ok, one last post about the total solar eclipse and then I‚Äôm done talking about it. (Maybe.)
There are so many mind-blowing things about eclipses but the one I can‚Äôt stop thinking about is the nearly impossible coincidence that the sun and the moon are the same relative size in the sky. If the moon were a little bit smaller or farther away, we wouldn‚Äôt have total eclipses where you can look directly at the sun, see the corona, the sky goes dark, you see a sunset effect all around the horizon, etc. That is some spooky magical shit. Ted Underwood put it this way:
Random accident that the moon and sun are the same apparent size here. If we had interstellar tourism, this is the One Thing that everyone would know about the Earth, and when they visited they wouldn‚Äôt want to see anything else. ‚ÄúW‚Ä¶</p>

                  <p>It works! Three men stranded on a tiny Pacific island for more than a week were rescued after the Coast Guard spotted ‚ÄúHELP‚Äù written out on the beach in palm leaves. (A similar rescue from the same island happened in 2020 ‚Äî ‚ÄúSOS‚Äù that time.)

                  <p>Wonderful shots of the pyramids of Giza by Egyptian photographer Karim Amr. From a caption on one of his photos three years ago:
I‚Äôm a 21 years old photographer you can see a lot of photos I share at the pyramids cause I just live near the pyramids so it‚Äôs easy for me to go and shoot there. I started doing photography to share my thoughts with others it‚Äôs how I express my feelings it‚Äôs also my escape from life. Life is tough and not easy for some of us and you got to find your place in this world.


Prints of his photos are available and you can follow his work on Instagram.

                  <p>When I quit my magazine job, I decided to try my hand as an artist. ‚Ä¶ I got frustrated easily and gave up easily, never knowing when to persevere or surrender. ‚Ä¶

My curiosity is earthbound: Where do [artists] begin, and what do they do next, and when do they know they are finished? And more crucially: What do they do when they lose faith? Do they lose faith?

In an adaptation from his new book, The Work of Art: How Something Comes From Nothing, former New York magazine editor Adam Moss shares his interviews with Kara Walker, Louise Gl√ºck, and Cheryl Pope, about their respective creative processes [Vulture]. My favorite part is the intro, though, where he talks about his own process (‚Äúthat was the beginning of my torment‚Äù).
I‚Äôm hoping the answer to the ‚Äúpersevere or surrender‚Äù question is in there very explicitly, by the way!

                  <p>Let‚Äôs say the countries of the world most responsible for the changing climate continue to drag their feet on doing something about it. What is the world going to look like in 20 or 30 or 80 years? This TED-Ed video describes that bleak potential future.
Reports on heatwaves and wildfires regularly fill the evening news. Summer days exceed 40 degrees in London and 45 degrees in Delhi, as extreme heat waves are now 8 to 9 times more common. These high temperatures prompt widespread blackouts, as power grids struggle to keep up with the energy demands needed to properly cool homes. Ambulance sirens blare through the night, carrying patients suffering from heatstroke, dehydration, and exhaustion. The southwestern United States, southern Africa, and eastern Australia experience longer, more frequent, and more severe droughts.
Meanwhile, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Japan face more frequent heavy rainfall as rising temperatures cause water to evaporate faster, and trap more water in the atmosphere. As the weather becomes more erratic, some communities are unable to keep pace with rebuilding what‚Äôs constantly destroyed.

                  <p>Okay, yes, the eclipse was pretty cool, but we weren‚Äôt in the path of totality (we were at like 96%), so I didn‚Äôt have the Transcendent Experience that some have described. I mean, it was definitely neat. And we did get cute pictures. And it does sort of feel like a little gremlin has been set loose in my soul. But my neck was also sore the day after. Worth it???

error messages. I‚Äôve had many years to get used to these error messages so it
took me a really long time to understand why folks were confused, but having
thought about it much more, I‚Äôve realized that:
sometimes I actually am confused by the error messages, I‚Äôm just used to
being confused
I have a bunch of strategies for getting more information when the error
message git gives me isn‚Äôt very informative
So in this post, I‚Äôm going to go through a bunch of Git‚Äôs error messages,
list a few things that I think are confusing about them for each one, and talk
about what I do when I‚Äôm confused by the message.
improving error messages isn‚Äôt easy

                  <p>David Lynch is not having any of that ‚Äúyou need to struggle or be tortured in order to be creative‚Äù stuff. In this video compilation, the director talks about how poor mental health inhibits art &amp; creativity.

It stands to reason: the more you suffer, the less you want to create. If you‚Äôre truly depressed, they say you can‚Äôt even get out of bed, let alone create. It occupies the whole brain, poisons the artist, poisons the environment; little room for creativity.


Open Culture has more on how Lynch uses transcendental meditation to improve his mental health‚Ä¶and a great anecdote about the one time Lynch tried therapy:
In one Charlie Rose interview, a clip from which appears in the video, he even tells of the time he went to therapy. The beginning of this story makes it in, but not the end: Lynch asked his new therapist ‚Äústraight out, right up front, ‚ÄòCould this process that we‚Äôre going to go through affect creativity?‚Äô And he said, ‚ÄòDavid, I have to be honest with you, it could‚Äù ‚Äî whereupon Lynch shook the man‚Äôs hand and walked right back out the door.

                  <p>The writer Amanda Fortini tweeted something a couple weeks ago that I haven‚Äôt stopped thinking about: 
Years ago, when I was in my 20s, a bold and artistically daring older friend who has since passed on gave me what I often think was the best advice I have ever gotten. I was worrying what ‚Äòpeople would think‚Äô of a decision I had made, and she said, ‚ÄúAmanda, There is no audience.‚Äù


The tweet went viral, so this probably isn‚Äôt news to a lot of readers. But I‚Äôve been saying it to myself ever since: Amanda, there is no audience. Somehow, for a few seconds at a time, it makes sense to me on a very deep level. The ‚ÄúAmanda‚Äù part seems essential, too, for whatever reason.

                  <p>Well, the total solar eclipse was once again completely awesome. I didn‚Äôt have to go chasing all over tarnation this time, the telescope worked out amazingly well, and I got to share it with a bunch of first-timers, both in-person and via text. I‚Äôm going to share some thoughts, photos, and videos from others around the internet in an even bloggier fashion than usual. Here we go.
My pal Noah Kalina got one of my favorite shots of the day (see also):

Gobsmacking shot from Rami Ammoun‚Ä¶it‚Äôs a blend of multiple exposures so you can see the sun and moon at the same time. Love this shot.

And another stunner from Andrew McCarthy:

Ryan Cox got some great shots of the solar prominences during totality.

                  <p>Hey, gang. Today is the solar eclipse, it‚Äôs supposed to be mostly sunny here in Colchester, VT, we‚Äôve got 3 minutes and 16 seconds of totality to enjoy, and I built a solar filter for my telescope (and binoculars!), so kottke.org is going to take the day off. Edith and I will see you back here tomorrow.
In the meantime, are you doing anything for the eclipse? Anyone got any crazy camera/telescope setups? Do you think Instagram is going to crash this afternoon? Will I completely lose my mind if a cloud drifts in front of the sun today at 3:26pm ET? Is it a coincidence or a miracle that we happen to be alive during the relatively brief period of time when the moon almost exactly covers the sun, resulting in total solar eclipses? Could you imagine if the eclipse somehow doesn‚Äôt happen today??!

                  <p>From the Center for Research on Vermont at UVM, a pair of eclipse glasses from 1932. I found a product listing for these ‚Äî they were marketed as the Eclipse-O-Scope and sold for 10¬¢.
VPR‚Äôs Nina Keck recently interviewed Floyd Van Alstyne, who is currently 104 but was 12 years old during the 1932 eclipse:
KECK: It was in the middle of the depression, he reminds me. And while he learned about the eclipse in his one-room schoolhouse, he doesn‚Äôt recall too much hoopla surrounding it.
F VAN ALSTYNE: I don‚Äôt know. We didn‚Äôt think much about general things in those days like they do now. Or we thought about minding their own business, I guess.

                  <p>In 1900, celebrated magician (and astronomy enthusiast) Nevil Maskelyne travelled to North Carolina to film a solar eclipse on May 28, 1900. The Royal Astronomical Society and the British Film Institute reckon this is ‚Äúthe first surviving astronomical film in the world‚Äù.
In 1898 he travelled to India to photograph an eclipse. He succeeded but the film can was stolen on his return journey home. 
It was not an easy feat to film. Maskelyne had to make a special telescopic adapter for his camera to capture the event. This is the only film by Maskelyne that we know to have survived.
The original film fragment held in The Royal Astronomical Society‚Äôs archive has been painstakingly scanned and restored in 4K by conservation experts at the BFI National Archive, who have reassembled and retimed the film frame by frame. The film is part of BFI Player‚Äôs recently released Victorian Film collection, viewers are now able to experience this first film of a solar eclipse since the event was originally captured over a century ago.

                  <p>This could be an SNL sketch! ‚Äî but it‚Äôs also delightful. It‚Äôs a trailer for The Sound of Knitting, ‚Äúan evening where classical music and knitting merge.‚Äù The popular designers and podcasters Arne &amp; Carlos teamed up with the Norwegian string instrument group (heh) Trondheimsolistene to make a concert/tutorial/behind-the-scenes knitting video, available for purchase. In addition to featuring knitting-friendly music, the video includes a tour of the Norwegian municipality of Selbu, famous for its gorgeous mittens, as well as a virtual class on how to knit those mittens. It all seems lovely, although I confess I was slightly disappointed that ‚Äúthe sound of knitting‚Äù wasn‚Äôt an ASMR video of needles clicking, although I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs out there, too. I mean, I know it is because I‚Äôve seen it.
Plus, as a recent NY Times story outlined, handwork is good for the brain.

                  <p>I‚Äôve always been intrigued by the ‚ÄúJolene‚Äù lyrics (are they mature or are they insane?), so I was excited to hear Beyonc√©‚Äôs version. Ultimately those lyrics didn‚Äôt really speak to me, but then I came across novelist Sonora Jha‚Äôs twist on the ‚ÄúJolene‚Äù lyrics on Instagram, and I felt an itch had been scratched. I‚Äôve transcribed those lyrics below ‚Äî her original post is here.
(With apologies to Dolly and Beyonc√©)

There are many¬†earlier examples of smilies, but this is likely what popularized emoticons as we know them today.

                  <p>Sophia Bogle is an expert at restoring old books and I was riveted by this video of her taking viewers through the deconstruction and restoration process, including a tour of her workshop and some of the tools she uses (e.g. a repair knife she designed herself to resemble a fingertip).
But reader, I gasped when she signed her work‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt think I could do that! (via boing boing)

                  <p>I missed this when it came out two weeks ago, but I‚Äôm glad to have found it this morning: Paul Simon unaccompanied, singing ‚ÄúYour Forgiveness‚Äù from his new album, Seven Psalms. (The 33-minute album is meant to be listened to all in one go.) 
The docuseries Colbert mentions at the end ‚Äî In Restless Dreams: The Music of Paul Simon, by Alex Gibney ‚Äî came out on March 17 (trailer here). I haven‚Äôt seen it yet but very much want to.

Jim‚Äôs latest book of poems is called Hoetry, and you can catch him hosting Bad Animals on WFMU on Mondays 8-9pm. He‚Äôs also on Instagram.

                  <p>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart‚Äôs first surviving musical composition was created at age five and in this video visualization, you can hear and see how his music evolved from that early piece to those created in his 20s and 30s. Not knowing a whole lot about music or of Mozart in particular, I was shocked at how incredible his compositions were at ages five, six, and seven. Sheesh.

                  <p>It‚Äôs been about five years since scientists captured the first blurry image of a black hole. Using what they learned from that experience, they‚Äôve teased out some more detailed images of the black holes at the centers of the Milky Way galaxy (top) and the M87 galaxy (bottom). The process of collecting the data for these images is interesting:
The only way to ‚Äúsee‚Äù a black hole is to image the shadow created by light as it bends in response to the object‚Äôs powerful gravitational field. As Ars Science Editor John Timmer reported in 2019, the EHT isn‚Äôt a telescope in the traditional sense. Instead, it‚Äôs a collection of telescopes scattered around the globe. The EHT is created by interferometry, which uses light in the microwave regime of the electromagnetic spectrum captured at different loca‚Ä¶</p>

                  <p>In this Crash Course video, author and ‚ÄúTB-hater‚Äù John Green takes a deep dive into tuberculosis.
This is the story of the deadliest infectious disease of all time. It‚Äôs been with us for 3 million years, since before humans were homo sapiens. We have evidence of it in the mummies of ancient Egypt, and it‚Äôs mentioned in the Hebrew Bible.
We‚Äôve made extraordinary medical advances. Vaccines, antibiotics, and clean water have saved millions of lives. And yet despite that, in 2022, this disease killed more people than malaria, typhoid, cholera, homicide, and war‚Ä¶combined.
It has gone by many names. In ancient China, it was known as huaifu, meaning ‚Äúdestroyed palace.‚Äù In ancient Hebrew, ‚Äúschachepheth,‚Äù meaning wasting away. The 19th-century term: ‚Äúconsumption,‚Äù for the way it seemed to consume the body. Today, we call it tuberculosis.

                  <p>COWEN: What is your most unusual successful work habit?
ROBINSON: I think it‚Äôs becoming used to the fact that it takes me a long time to get to the place where I can work on something ‚Äî that all this frustration [laughs] and depression that precedes my writing anything is part of the process of writing.


As someone who‚Äôs interested in finding God, I liked letting this religion-themed conversation wash over me. I also liked the idea that creative projects just have to take as long as they take and be as hard as they are. Robinson‚Äôs new book is about Genesis ‚Äî she calls the Bible ‚Äúthe most complex document on the planet‚Äù ‚Äî but in the interview they touch on several non-religious topics, too (like the above). Meanwhile I‚Äôm enjoying reading the negative reviews of her book on Amazon, which is probably bad (of me).

                  <p>I noticed some tech bloggers I follow have been making April Cools Day posts about topics they don‚Äôt normally write
about (like decaf or microscopes). The goal isn‚Äôt to
trick anyone, just to write about something different for a day.
I thought those posts were fun so here is a post with some notes on learning to crochet tiny cacti.
first, the cacti
I‚Äôve been trying to do some non-computer hobbies, without putting a lot of
pressure on myself to be ‚Äúgood‚Äù at them. Here are some cacti I crocheted:

They are a little wonky and I like them.
a couple of other critters
Here are a couple of other things I made: an elephant, an orange guy, a
much earlier attempt at a cactus, and an in-progress cactus




Some of these are also pretty wonky, but sometimes it adds to the charm: for

                  <p>Hey everyone!
This is the list of all the changes we&#x27;ve done to our projects during the month of March.
Summary Of Changes
100r.co, added chainplates, knots, washing dishes, receiving mail, updated our notes on diy carbonation system, and refrigeration.
Uxn, added 2 new commands to Varvara&#x27;s System/expansion port and rewrote uxnasm.
Some toys, made a two-player implementation of Pong, and an orca that follows the cursor like that old classic flash web toy.
Left, improved the object inspector, it&#x27;s much prettier now!
Kokorobot has a new splash page.
News
Pino now has all-new chainplates! We removed the original ones earlier this month to inspect them and found some pit corrosion(as well as a small crack), replacing them was necessary. With the chainplates gone, we removed the entire starboard side cabinet to see what was behind it‚Äîit&#x27;s always nice to see parts of our boat we&#x27;ve never seen. We also replaced 3 old halyards on Pino. Devine earned themself a couple of blisters splicing dyneema onto some of our existing halyards.
Sejo revisited the Uxn tutorial, and appended corrections. The most important change is that the tutorial is now targeting the learn-uxn platform(online) maintained by metasyn. Now, people can jump right in and experiment without having to set up a dev environment. Tsoding, someone who can code in front of the camera in a language they&#x27;ve never used or read the docs for, did a pretty funny session in Uxntal, you can watch it here.
There has been too many exciting Uxn projects coming out these past few days, so we&#x27;ll just put a link to the hashtag. Someone also created a Discord channel, it&#x27;s a good place to learn about other concatenative languages and an alternative for people who have trouble with #uxn, in irc.libera.chat.
Pino book &amp; movie club
This month we are reading The Last Great Sea by Terry Glavin, and we watched the movie Tenet.

                  <p>This year, the React team unveiled something they&#x27;ve been quietly researching for years: an official way to run React components exclusively on the server. This is a significant paradigm shift, and it&#x27;s caused a whole lot of confusion in the React community. In this tutorial, we&#x27;ll explore this new world, and build an intuition for how it works, and how we can take advantage of it.</p>

                  <p>For so many React devs, styled-components seems kinda magical. It isn&#x27;t at all clear how it uses traditional CSS features under-the-hood, and that lack of clarity can cause real problems when things go awry. In this post, we&#x27;ll learn exactly how styled-components works by building our own mini-version.</p>

                  <p>Ryan Williams is an Australian scooter and BMX rider who does wild tricks that make me nervous. In 2013 he perfected a back flip with a nothing front scooter flip, which means he does a backflip while his scooter does a front flip, and then he spent about 10 years trying to get it done on a bike. Travis Pastrana dubbed it the Free Willy. Below is an example of a slightly different trick where he does a front flip instead of a backflip, except this one is easy because he can kind of see where the bike is. Easy. This one‚Äôs the easy one.

Here‚Äôs a behind the scenes of what it took him to figure out the Free Willy. At 1:40 you can see the first time he does it successfully on a scooter, and about 6:35 is when he gets it on the bike. Incredible stuff.

Williams won a gold with this trick at the 2023 X Games, obviously.

                  <p>I love books a bunch, mostly contemporary fiction and sometimes non-fiction, and I thought it would be fun if we had a comments thread about books you like or don‚Äôt like or want to read? Maybe you‚Äôll get a suggestion for something you‚Äôd like to read.
Here are some books I‚Äôve loved the last few years:
Harlem Shuffle and Crooks Manifesto by Colson Whitehead

Heaven and Earth Grocery and Deacon King Kong and The Good Lord Bird by James McBride

Final Revival of Opal and Nev by Dawnie Walton

Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow by Gabrielle Zevin

Sellout by Dan Ozzi

Gone to the Wolves by John Wray

This year I‚Äôve really liked: 
North Woods by Daniel Mason

Wellness by Nathan Hill

Biography of X by Catherine Lacey (I actually can‚Äôt decide if I liked this or if I just want to talk to people about it. I hated all the characters.)

The Rachel Incident by Caroline O‚ÄôDonoghue 

Running the Light by Sam Tallent

Favorites of all time!!
Undermajordomo Minor by Nick deWitt and 

Gentleman in Moscow by Amor Towles. (The long awaited TV adaptation of GiM with Ewan McGregor starts today on Showtime.)

Also, what do you think about a Kottke.org book club? Let‚Äôs do a bookclub, right? I‚Äôm not really sure how it would work except for probably we‚Äôd all read the same book at around the same time and then probably we‚Äôd all gather somewhere on this website and talk about the book, probably in a comments thread, though it remains to be seen. Comment down below if y‚Äôall are interested and Jason‚Äôs gonna come back from vacation and I‚Äôll say, ‚ÄúSurprise, buddy, now youse got a book club!‚Äù and then we‚Äôll go from there.

                  <p>This article about the pandemic-fueled of homemade rise of chilito candy sold by social media has been in my tab attic since 2021 just waiting around to be shared because I‚Äôm a sucker for the journalistic arts applied to candy. I introduced my kids to Taj√≠n-coated peach gummies after a trip to Oakland in 2018, and my two year called them Fire Cheerios because all round foods were Cheerios then. Taj√≠n is also good on mango ice cream, or anything really. 
Mexican chilito candies, or dulces enchilados, have been making the mouths of Texans pucker for at least as long as we‚Äôve been hitting pi√±atas. A colloquial catchall for a variety of sweets, chilito refers to the spice of chamoy, a traditional Mexican paste made from pickled fruits and spices. Chilito can come as a condiment, like on fruit ‚Ä¶</p>

                  <p>Tiger Tail ice cream is an orange ice cream with black licorice swirls generally only found in Canada (until this summer when you can get it in Somerville after I make it even though I‚Äôm not very good at swirling).
A ribbon of black licorice swirled into an orange-flavored ice cream base gives this tiger its stripes. The old-school flavor sold well in soda parlors from the 1950s to the 1970s, and many Canadians now consider it a childhood classic. As curious as it may seem, kids (and nostalgic adults) are among the biggest fans of the citrus and black licorice combination.

Tigers Blood sorbet is a sorbet with strawberry, coconut, and watermelon, and maybe we‚Äôll make that one, too. 
Depending on who you ask, Tiger‚Äôs Blood could have originated as early as the 1940s or as late as the 1990s and was invented anywhere from Hawaii to Texas. Regardless of what the true story is, it‚Äôs safe to say that its creation was a success as it remains incredibly popular across the country.




Tigers Blood is also the name of the new album by Waxahatchee. 

On Tigers Blood, no bond is linear or static. Some of these songs sound ready to run, bursting from the traps; others take their ease with intoxicating beauty. Love boomerangs and comes back. Sisters have an unexpected showdown about their respective heady and cautious approaches to life. 



See how it‚Äôs all come together now?

                  <p>The scaly-foot snail or sea pangolin developed overlapping scales of iron on its foot to survive the high temperatures blasted out by the hydrothermal vents in the Indian Ocean it lives near. It also has a huge snail heart because ‚Äúto accommodate the oxygen needs of symbiotic bacteria that live in their bodies and provide most of their nutrition.‚Äù 
Longtime Kottke readers will remember my friend Chris Piascik who drew this metal snail after I told him about the other metal snail. Chris has an excellent YouTube channel where he talks about stuff I can‚Äôt really understand in an engaging and delightful way. In 2018, Chris and I spent about 6 months working together and putting out a kids‚Äô book and he was mad at me every single day.

Saw a quote from Tyshawn Jones where he said he grew up watching this Andrew Reynolds - Baker 3 video and you can see the similarities in the size/speed of the tricks. (Frontside flips at :30 and 4:45ish, hooo boy.)

                  <p>Well, Fabio Wibmer is very, very fast on his bicycle. Just about the first trick in here is Fabio successfully jumping the Lyon 25 Stair we learned about earlier this week. And, uh, he does something we didn‚Äôt see in that other video because if you make it to the end of the video, you‚Äôll see he starts from the set of stairs going down to the Lyon 25 instead of starting on the flat like everyone else. Sheesh.
I also like how he takes the corner/curb at :50 and the stairs at 3:20 and the stairs at 5:15. Sheesh.

                  <p>A conversation at dinner with the kids left me wanting to know how to rhyme in sign language and when I found out, it feels like it should have been obvious. 
In phonology (the study of the smallest units of language), the parts of a signed word are: handshape, location, palm orientation, movement, and non-manual signal. They are called parameters. Each parameter has a number of primes. In sign language specifically ASL, the same parameter in two or more words (signs) are repeated. The parts may be the same handshape, movement, and/or location, or combined, but the handshape rhyme is the most commonly used.




And here‚Äôs an example of ASL poetry where you can clearly see the rhymes and music of the words in her poem. The poet, Christine Marshall, didn‚Äôt caption the poem and suggested viewers suggest a translation in the comments. The pinned translation is below.

                  <p>Dolly Parton‚Äôs ‚ÄòI Will Always Love You‚Äô was released 50 years ago a couple weeks ago and it‚Äôs a very good song. We all know Parton famously wrote IWALY and Jolene on the same day, which, like, one time I made 4 batches of ice cream and packed them all into pints and cleaned the machine all in an hour and forty five minutes and that‚Äôs kind of the same thing if you squint. She wrote the song to let Porter Wagoner know she was leaving his show and striking out on her own and that makes me mad because imagine working with someone so annoying you have to write one of the best songs ever written to get out of it. 
The year after it was released, Elvis was going to record it, but Tom Parker, his manager, insisted on half the publishing rights and Dolly said no, like a G. The whole germ for this post, my entire reason for being at this moment, was seeing that fact about Elvis and knowing Dolly teases IWALY not once, not twice, but, well, OK, only twice, on her duets album. It‚Äôs on Wrecking Ball, and she teases it AND sings about the whole episode on I Dreamed About Elvis. Priscilla Presley told Dolly Elvis loved the song so much and sang it to her on the day of their divorce. I do wish we could hear an Elvis recording of IWALY.
Dolly rerecorded the song for Best Little Whorehouse in Texas, but when Whitney covered IWALY, Dolly called it ‚ÄúOne of the biggest thrills and one of the most overwhelming feelings I‚Äôve ever had about anything in my life,‚Äù but that almost didn‚Äôt happen, too, twice, because they were going to do ‚ÄòWhat Becomes of the Broken Hearted‚Äô before that song got featured in Steel Magnolias (starring Dolly, wtf) and then Whitney was set to cover the Linda Ronstadt version which leaves off a verse at the end, but Dolly interceded at the last moment to set them straight.
Finally, my bar in Cambridge has a Dolly Parton-themed bathroom which has 5 stars on google maps and was written up in the New York Times.

                  <p>Punxsutawney Phil and his mate Phyllis have had babies and both of the articles I read about this deeply weirded me out. Listen, I get it, you don‚Äôt get to be President of The Punxsutawney Groundhog Club Inner Circle by being normal about groundhogs, but it feels a little culty to me.
To wit:
‚ÄúHe added that Phil‚Äôs children will not inherit his seer of seers or prognosticator abilities because, simply, there‚Äôs only one Phil.‚Äù Bro, what? Why wouldn‚Äôt the children inherit the mirth?
‚Äú[Phil] receives a special elixir to extend his life.‚Äù (Dunkel is at least better than the previous president who said in 2020 Phil was 134 years old, able to live forever because of the elixir, while Dunkel smartly refused to age the groundhog. (wood)Chuck Everlasting imo.)

                  <p>At the beginning of this documentary, the narrator says something about ‚Äúhow did whales end up in the ocean,‚Äù and to be honest that fucked me up because whales make sense to me if I think of them as something that‚Äôs always been in the ocean, and if I have to reorient my mind around the fact that maybe they used to not be in the ocean, I‚Äôve got to re-think a lot of things. On the other hand, the documentary is called When Whales Could Walk, so that‚Äôs on me. I should have seen that coming. I did that to myself. And now I‚Äôm doing it to you.
This fossil graveyard, millions of years old, is known as the ‚ÄúValley of the Whales.‚Äù Now, paleontologists have unearthed a whole new species of ancient whale dating to 43 million years ago, and this predator wasn‚Äôt just able to swim ‚Äì it also had four legs and could walk.

                  <p>I like the skate videos where the skaters show how high or fast or far they can go and the control they have over their bodies while flying through the air, but I also like the videos where the skaters put their feet on the ground sometimes and use the board as more than something to ride on, as a prop. Gou Miyagi does a lot of tricks like that, riding up to a set of steps, running up the rail, sliding down on his butt, and landing on the board, and skating off, things of that nature. It all looks very nice.

                  <p>Because I don‚Äôt hardly blog anymore, I turned the email newsletter for my ice cream shop into kind of a blog where sure I talk about ice cream a good amount, but I also tell stories about when I was a tour manager for a band, document how terribly hostile Intuit is towards their business customer base, and share internet ephemera my customers might not have seen. It‚Äôs been feeling a little stale lately, because after three years I think I finally told all my tour stories so I wanted to do something new. 
The new thing is Road Snacks, a semi-regular feature where an ice cream shop interviews a touring musician asking questions about the food situation on tour. I think it‚Äôs changed a lot and probably not too much since I was doing it. The first interview ran today featuring Cary Ann Hearst f‚Ä¶</p>

                  <p>Hey, real quick, what‚Äôs something you always wanted to do, but only just started to learn how to do in the last year? I always wanted to learn how to play guitar and last year my son and I started taking guitar lessons together and now I can sort of play guitar a little.
If you‚Äôre trying to convince yourself to learn something you should just do it because you might still be shitty at whatever you‚Äôre learning 6 months from now, but you‚Äôll be much better than you‚Äôd be if you didn‚Äôt start until 6 months from now. I think I saw someone say this more eloquently (obviously), but when I tried to find it, all I could find was someone saying imagine if you started 6 months ago, which I think is a recipe for making yourself feel bad, and I bet you don‚Äôt need any help doing that, do you?
So, what‚Äôd you learn how to do this year or if you haven‚Äôt learned anything new yet, what are you going to start learning how to do this year?

                  <p>This 2013 Kings of Leon cover of Robyn‚Äôs Dancing on My Own inspired Callum Scott to sing Dancing on My Own for his audition for Britain‚Äôs Got Talent, which eventually lead to Scott‚Äôs version of the song hitting #2 on the UK charts in 2016 and becoming the #1 download in the UK that summer. The original version topped out at 8. 

Here‚Äôs the original.


Here‚Äôs a country version.


Here‚Äôs a punk cover validating my theory stating pop songs usually sound good as punk songs.

Anyway, I was thinking about this because a few years ago I made a playlist for the kids of all the covers of Dancing on My Own I could find and there were 56 back then. Today I added all the ones which were added to Apple Music in the last few years and now there are 91 total on the list, though 2 or 3 are remixes.

                  <p>I get furious every spring there isn‚Äôt an iced tea soda because I just want to try it once even though I know it would probably be terrible and we have chocolate milk soda and I can‚Äôt get iced tea soda? It‚Äôs madness is what it is. 
The lack of iced tea soda is only an aside to the main news of this post, offered as preamble, because you can‚Äôt really just jump into something like hot dog seltzer water without some sort of sweetener, some sort of softening the ground ahead of the news, an amuse bouche if you will. 
I‚Äôm pretty angry about this because it‚Äôs probably an April Fools joke announced early and corporations fucking lie all the time, but the least they could do is not pre-announce an April Fools joke. Now that April Fools has been coopted by try-hard brands, uh, trying too hard, a really good and cool thing for a brand to do would be to announce something what seems like a joke on April Fools and then actually deliver. No more phony bologna. If the Big Bite Hot Dog Sparkling Water is not a figment of commercial japery, if it is not a form of incorporated jackassery, if it actually exists on April 2nd, I‚Äôll eat my hat drink one.
 
The Big Bite Hot Dog Sparkling Water promises to encapsulate the essence of the iconic 7-Eleven hot dog experience, complete with the flavors of ketchup and mustard. This innovative beverage aims to transform the traditional pairing of hot dogs and sodas, allowing consumers to enjoy the essence of their favorite snack in a refreshing bubbly form.

                  <p>I&#x27;ve been eyeballing Cricut machines for a few years now, but it was mostly for stickers for my own use and the cost just couldn&#x27;t be justified.
However, last Sunday I found a faulty Cricut on eBay, put an offer out and it arrived on Wednesday for a total of ¬£35 (including postage).
When plugging the power lead in, the power button briefly shows red and the cutter lights up, but then it all immediately dies. I figured I&#x27;d need to get to the power connect to check the state of the connect and the PCB - perhaps there was a short.
After a lot of screws and jiggling to release plastic covers, I eventually made it to the motherboard, which, on first inspection looked entirely clean.
Looking closer though, the DC barrel connector had a small crack. When I prodded the connector, I could see it was moving, and in fact the positive leg was broken and no longer connected to the motherboard.
My guess is that it was plugged in, someone snagged the power cable but the lead didn&#x27;t remove, instead breaking the DC barrel connector and tearing it out of the motherboard.
Some careful soldering and lot of replacement of screws and I now have a working Cricut. Tidy.</p>

                  <p>I love Australian pro skater Ricky Glaser‚Äôs narration of all the videos he could find of people attempting to jump a famous set of 25 stairs in Lyon. Aaron ‚ÄúJaws‚Äù Homoki (no relation), was the first to do it despite injuring himself on the stairs previously. At 6:15 the scooter carnage starts, ‚ÄúLike is he alive after that?‚Äù We can also appreciate Glaser‚Äôs criticism of the camera work at about 9:50. This is truly a masterpiece.

By the way, you may have heard of Ricky Glaser, as he is the world record holder for most kick flips in a minute, 36, which is just about 3 per second if my math is right.

                  <p>There was a race in Paris where waiters from all the restaurants and cafes and hotels rush through the streets carrying trays with water, croissants, and empty cups of coffee. The race started around 1914, but then it stopped for the last 13 years and now they‚Äôre doing it again because of the Olympics next this year. The runners can switch hands, but they can‚Äôt carry the tray with two hands, and if their glass has less than 10cm of water when they finish, they get 30 seconds added to their finish time. Congratulations to this year‚Äôs winners, Pauline Van Wymeersch and Samy Lamrous. At the end of the race the guy said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre finished!‚Äù And the winners said, ‚ÄúNo, we‚Äôre French.‚Äù

                  <p>Jason‚Äôs only got one rule for guest editors and it‚Äôs, ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre going to post about Utrecht once, you have to post about Utrecht three times,‚Äù which is a bad rule imo and problematic for me because I don‚Äôt know anything about Utrecht except they got bones full of drugs there and a doorbell for fish.
Luckily, I am American and did the American thing of texting the only Dutch person I know when I saw the fish doorbell was opening up for the year, because obviously everyone from the Netherlands will already know about the fish doorbell. He didn‚Äôt know about the fish doorbell, but he did used to be an intern at the Musical Clock Museum in Utrecht, which is a museum focusing on self-playing instruments and musical clocks. The Museum Speelklok appears to contain the second largest such collection in the world behind the Musical Museum in Brentford, which has them beat on self-playing instruments, though it‚Äôs not clear how many musical clocks they‚Äôve got at MM. Regardless, the Utrecht Musical Clock Museum appears delightful and you should visit after visiting the fish doorbell.
Update:
Wintergatan. The marble machine in the video below is exhibited at Museum Speelklok.

(Jason previously wrote about Martin Molin‚Äôs Wintergatan projects in 2020, which were inspired by Martin‚Äôs visit to Museum Speelklok in 2016.)

                  <p>Fish in the Netherlands travel upstream to spawn in the spring, but unfortunately for the fish in Utrecht, the boat lock on the river through the city is closed in the spring. Ecologists put a camera on the bottom of the lock, and viewers around the world can watch a livestream of the camera and, when they see a fish, press a doorbell to open the lock allowing the fish the opportunity to continue swimming upstream to their destiny.
This is a YouTube livestream of the doorbell camera, which is what gets shown to viewers on days like today when more than 900 people are watching the camera, but fear not because they post a weekly highlight reel.

You probably missed the pike and ide, but perch, common roach, and freshwater bream should be swimming by around now.
PS the domain is visdeurbel.nl, which translates into English as Fish Doorbell, and I think Dutch is a very charming language.

                  <p>Researchers from the Freie Universit√§t Berlin working in the Netherlands recently found a little bone container full of drugs in a pile of 86,000 other bones they had found outside a farm in what is now the Dutch city of Utrecht. Initially the researchers missed the find because they weren‚Äôt looking for a first century C.E. bone full of drugs in a bone stack (that‚Äôs a needle in a haystack joke I was afraid you wouldn‚Äôt get, so I‚Äôm just pointing it out, but if you did get it, I‚Äôm sorry for not trusting you as a reader.).
The bone container, discovered when a birch pitch plug was dislodged, was full of black hebane seeds which back in the olden olden olden days was used for ‚Äúrelieving pain and helping with difficult pregnancies. Yet ingesting too much, one Roman author wrote, could lead to ‚Äúalienation of [the] mind or madness‚Äù.‚Äù
Ancient Roman authors were clearly familiar with the plant. Pliny the Elder, Plutarch, and others wrote about black henbane, along with its closely related but less potent relatives, white and yellow henbane. These plants‚Äîin the form of ointments, potions, or burning smoke‚Äîwere prescribed for everything from earaches and toothaches to flatulence and ‚Äúpains of the womb.‚Äù Ancient scholars also warned against taking too much because of the potential for hallucinogenic effects; Pliny counseled physicians to avoid it entirely.

                  <p>Ilia Malinin is 19 and just won the world championship title of international ice skating or something by being an absolute wizard on ice skates. I‚Äôve only been on ice skates 6 or 7 times in my life and I‚Äôm getting better, but I‚Äôm still kinda wobbly, so don‚Äôt take my word for it. Just watch him do all sorts of triple cows lutz axles better than anyone‚Äôs ever done it. My favorite part is when he does the two twisty jumps in a row, which he does at least 3 different times. Imagine being half this good at anything, let alone something as difficult as jumping in circles WITH RAZOR BLADES SCREWED TO YOUR DOC MARTENS.
Malinin landed a quadruple Axel, quad Lutz, quad loop, quad Salchow, another quad Lutz and a quad toe loop, then finished his four-minute skate with a a triple Lutz-triple Axel finale.


I don‚Äôt live too far from Salem, and they still put people on trial for this kind of sorcery there.

                  <p>Imagine you own an ice cream shop and the thermostat on your dipping cabinet, which is the freezer ice cream is dipped (scooped) out of, is set to 4, which is too warm, and you want to make the freezer colder. Are you setting this dial to 3 or to 5 to make the freezer colder? I asked the Gracie‚Äôs followers on Instagram earlier this year and there was lots of discussion. Comment below with your answer unless you already follow Gracie‚Äôs on Instagram, in which case, zip it, buster.

                  <p>A bear enclosure at Woburn Safari Park in Bedfordshire flooded so the zookeepers gave the bears a swan boat to entertain them because as everyone knows, black bears are often mollified by large watercraft shaped like other animals, though you never want to give them a boat shaped like a vole for obvious reasons. The bears are called Harvard, Maple, Colorado, and Aspen, and I might be losing my mind because I stg there are 5 bears in this picture? Deputy Head of Carnivores, Tommy Babbington mused the bears were ‚Äúimmediately intrigued‚Äù by the boat, though admittedly I only quoted him here so I could use the phrase Deputy Head of Carnivores, Tommy Babbington, which is about the most best combination of job title and name I‚Äôve ever heard.
But for real, how many bears do you see?

                  <p>According to this 2014 article in Slate, roasting vegetables is a cooking technique popularized only in the 80s/90s.
The concept of roasting as a general vegetable technique seems to have originated in a famous Italian restaurant: Johanne Killeen and George Germon‚Äôs Al Forno, which opened in Providence, Rhode Island, in 1980. Forno means oven in Italian, and the critically acclaimed chefs made ample use of that apparatus.


This is a fact, which makes me feel old because I lived through it and makes me feel young because I lived through it. Old because I can remember a time before roasting vegetables was how anyone who is anyone prepared them, and young because what other cooking techniques are we going to invent during my lifetime? It‚Äôs a little like watching cities develop. For example, I used to work down in Fort Point in Boston and there were a ton of parking lots and then the guy who owned the parking lots sold them, bought the Los Angeles Baseball Dodgers and those parking lots have become a huge and glitzy neighborhood (?) with condos and offices and commerce
As another aside, there‚Äôs a 1993 NYT article quoted in the Slate piece and I‚Äôm quoting the first three sentences here for reasons I will expound upon afterward. 
Roasting wafts through the senses. In culinary terms it is freighted with mouthwatering aroma, comforting warmth, a crisping sizzle and anticipated succulence. And lately it is more appreciated than ever.


Anyway, the use of ‚Äúfreighted‚Äù just reminded me of the Emily Dickinson quotation, ‚ÄúThe freight should be proportioned to the groove‚Äù from the poem That Love is all there is. It‚Äôs a delightful poem and you can read it in about 3 seconds and think about it for the rest of your life.

                  <p>Cutting to the chase: text editors *and* tabs vs. spaces!  Ooooh!


I&#x27;ve had this thing called &quot;e&quot; for a while now.  It&#x27;s a stupid little 
script which serves to do a couple of things.  It starts my 
editor
with a given file, and it kicks it with the right arguments to make it 
disable line wrapping and to make the [TAB] key actually put in two 
spaces.


So, my dumb script would use &quot;-w -E -T 2&quot; most of the time, except when it 
was running on a Makefile, at which point it would skip those args.  
Simple enough, right?


pico is back?  Yes indeed, on Macs, as of 12.3, pico is in fact back.  To 
make sure I wasn&#x27;t imagining things, I tracked down a machine that hadn&#x27;t 
been upgraded yet and checked there.  Sure enough, it was in fact nano and 
not pico.


macOS 12.3 has nano as a symlink... pointing to pico!


At some point, I switched from literal tab characters in my source code to 
blobs of spaces, probably due to using that style at work and not hating 
it.  So, somewhere along the line I actually started depending on nano 
behavior without realizing it.


As for the lack of a feature in pico itself, it&#x27;s kind of strange, really.  
If you go digging into the source, they have this random.c with a function 
called tab which claims to &quot;simulate tab stop&quot; using spaces.  That said, I 
can&#x27;t find any place where it would be called with the magic values which 
would make it behave that way.


It wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if this switch is just more of Apple removing 
GPLed things from their OS - pico seems to use the Apache license.  They 
dumped bash for zsh (MIT license) at some point (Big Sur, I think), and 
now this?  Okay then.</p>

                  <p>Here&#x27;s a very old and stupid trick you could do with some filesystems in 
some situations back in the day... and might still be able to do in a 
few places today.


The problem is that while version X might eventually have an exploit, 
it&#x27;ll get removed and it&#x27;ll be replaced by version Y without that
particular hole.  By the time you get your hands on a tool to break into 
X, it&#x27;ll be gone.


What you&#x27;d do is create a hard link pointing at the file you wanted to 
preserve, storing it in a spot which was writable by your account.  
Then, say, /usr/bin/sudo (because that never has security 
issues...) gets replaced at some point with a new file and you get to 
keep the old version.  When you get the tool to pop it, off you go!


Of course, these days, it&#x27;s not quite so easy on the more modern systems 
you find.  Debian 11 here won&#x27;t let me do it - it&#x27;s EPERM city.  Rocky 8 
(so CentOS 8 and RHEL 8 too) also won&#x27;t do it.  They both have some gunk
in /usr/lib/sysctl.d to lock this down.  But, my old Slackware 14.2 
install of my workstation let me do it the last time I tried about 
a year ago.  How about that, huh?  I bet it&#x27;d still work if I dug out 
the old drives and booted them up.


Incidentally, this is the magic sauce: /proc/sys/fs/protected_hardlinks
Read the man page for proc(5) to learn more about it.

here it is,
the thread I read a long time ago.  It&#x27;s interesting to note that as far 
as I can tell, nothing actually changed upstream.  This left paranoid 
admins like me with no option but to use the (most excellent) Openwall 
patches to lock down this kind of stuff.  I used that on my machines at 
work which had non-staff users... just in case.


This whole situation is scary.

                  <p>Back in January, you might have seen my
post
about a very large BBS which seemed to solve for the problem of &quot;how do 
we host a bunch of users&quot; by having one physical box per user.  It might 
have been one physical box per *two* users, maybe, but it&#x27;s hard to say.


Now, keep in mind digital cameras weren&#x27;t easy to come by, so I have 
very few actual pictures.  I&#x27;ll have to do a lot of explaining to make 
up for the lack of detail and alternate angles.  Clearly, I had no 
notion of ever using these pictures to tell stories 25+ years later.


Some friends at a local company had some bandwidth to spare (a T1 to 
Alternet somewhere, as I recall), so they parked a Zoom modem on one of 
their boxes and plugged it into a phone line.  We got an identical model

offices before the whole COVID lockdown thing happened and people 
largely stopped going to offices every day.  With that in mind, let&#x27;s 
proceed.

brought about this whole notion of &quot;microkitchens&quot;.  This is where

&quot;Pepsi&quot;) and would load it up with every kind of fizzy sugary liquid

                  <p>One of the fun things I used to do at a prior job was to dig through the 
raw data points which were collected from the *many* servers we had.  I 
could just pick an interesting-sounding metric and then would just ask 
the system to show me the top 10 or bottom 10 out of a population of 
thousands or more.


To get my feet wet with the whole &quot;investigations&quot; thing that we&#x27;d do, I 
started looking into this one day and chose one of the many temp sensors 
which were being logged by the servers.  I forget exactly which one it 
was, for there were many.  The CPUs logged it, the chassis logged it, 
the power supply logged it, and so on.  There were so many choices.


I went looking for a reason.  What could possibly explain this?  First 
off, it didn&#x27;t line up with any obvious pattern in the host names.  The 
hosts were named for whichever team owned them, followed by a sequence 
number that was bumped any time a new one was provisioned.  There was no 
signal to be found in that.


There was more, though.  You could also see a &quot;rack position&quot; in this 
data, and now it started getting interesting.  It seems that all of the 
really hot machines had a rack position of something low, like 04 or 05, 
and never anything higher than that.  In fact, when looking at a whole 
rack, it was always the lowest number of all of the positions that were 
being used.  Now this was worth chasing!


It&#x27;s good that I asked, since they told me something surprising: 
position 04 or 05 or whatever was the *bottom* of the rack.  Yes, 
somehow, the lowest machine in the rack was the hottest!  They found 
this interesting, too, and wound up digging into it.  Given that I was 
far away in a distant office, this was the best way for us to proceed.


The problem was that the bottommost server would have nothing below it 
but just open space until it got to the floor.  That space would not 
move air efficiently, and it obviously mattered.


This rolled out and my hot spots disappeared.  Fantastic!</p>

                  <p>Another day, another bit of local flavor, but this time it&#x27;s something I 
wish I didn&#x27;t have to write about.

wrote
about seeing a maintenance truck rolling down the Caltrain line in 
Mountain View.  It had a special attachment to let it stay on the rails.  
At no point did the arms come down for the crossing.  It managed to 
approach, then the people inside looked around and went through, and the 
arms never budged.  There were no flashing lights or bells.




caught fire.  A bunch of people were hurt.  More were shaken 
up.


I&#x27;m assuming their construction trucks don&#x27;t trigger the &quot;short the 
rails together to signal various things&quot; logic, either.  This would 
mean that crossing arms stay up... and I have to assume it also means 
the signals along the way stay green instead of going red.

We will presumably hear more about whatever the signals said, and 
whether the train went past a red signal or not.  I just have a bad 
feeling that they saw a green and kept on going.</p>

                  <p>Here&#x27;s a little bit of Silicon Valley local flavor for a change.  We 
have this freeway that runs from San Jose to San Francisco called US 
101, or around here, just &quot;101&quot;.  (Southern California has it too, but 
they call it &quot;the&quot; 101.  That&#x27;s how we detect invaders.)  Anyway, this 
thing is usually eight or more lanes up and down the peninsula, and it&#x27;s 
had a &quot;diamond&quot; or car pool lane on the #1 (innermost/&quot;fast&quot;) lane for 
many years.  You had to have a certain number of people in the car (or 
some other conditions met) during certain hours (AM and PM rush, 
weekdays), or you&#x27;d be in for a hefty ticket.


How does the system know what to charge you?  Well, you either have an 
old-style toll transponder that always bills you as a solo driver, or 
you have a new-style transponder with a 1/2/3+ switch that tells the 
road how to handle you.


Think about what this does to enforcement.  Now, instead of just &quot;is 
there a vehicle in the lane&quot;, &quot;is it the right time during a weekday&quot;, 
and &quot;how many people are in the car&quot;, now it&#x27;s also a matter of &quot;do they 
have their transponder set properly&quot;.


Check this out.

                  <p>I already told a
story
about how you can hose your machine by pointing the Linux kernel at a 
custom core dump handler and then have that handler fail to function.  
This&#x27;ll clog up the pipe (really), and then everything else will just 
stack up behind it.  Pretty soon, every crashing process will be stuck 
just the same.


Once upon a time, in a big company environment, someone decided that 
they wanted to provide a service to other things running on the same 
Linux box.  But, instead of either writing Yet Another Service (tm) 
that would go through release processes and all of that good stuff, they 
went for a different design entirely.


There are so many problems with this.  You have the issue of a &quot;server&quot;

                  <p>If a web site makes an RSS or Atom feed available, it&#x27;s not a bad idea 
to poll it from time to time.  Actually doing that poll like a good 
netizen (remember that concept?) takes a little attention to detail.


Given the reality of the situation, does it make sense to poll every 10 
seconds?  Probably not, right?  Someone set up something like that and 
left it running for a couple of months until I finally noticed it and 
dealt with it myself.


Given this, you can keep track of the &quot;Last-Modified&quot; header when you 
get a copy of the feed.  Then, you can turn around and use that same 
value in an &quot;If-Modified-Since&quot; header the next time you come to look 
for an update.  If nothing&#x27;s changed, the web server will notice it&#x27;s 
the same as what it already has, and it&#x27;ll send you a HTTP 304 co‚Ä¶</p>

                  <p>Here&#x27;s a concept: &quot;ssh to prod and edit directly on the machine&quot; is 
generally bad news.


I should point out that I didn&#x27;t know this person and had no idea how 
they would respond to such feedback - it might have been fine!  They 
might be a well-adjusted person who can take a request like that and not 
turn it around into a full-on nuclear attack.  But, I didn&#x27;t know either 
way.


At some point, I actually had a meeting with this developer for some 
other reason, and what happened was kind of amazing.  First thing, he 
brought it up and asked me about it.  I said something like, &quot;well, I 
didn&#x27;t want to get into it, but since you asked&quot;, and proceeded into 
something along the lines of &quot;obviously it would be best if you didn&#x27;t 
do that - sshing in and twiddling Python files on the actual production 
AWS instance of the service&quot;.


&quot;But... I suspect you are doing it for some reason?&quot;


My response was... I hope... reasonable: &quot;So as much as I would love to 
say &#x27;don&#x27;t do that!!!&#x27;, I&#x27;m not going to stand in the way of you 
literally doing your job.  So please proceed with care, and keep an eye 
open for some day when (first dumb thing) and (second dumb thing) aren&#x27;t 
problems any more and you need not do this any more.&quot;


It was either &quot;edit in prod&quot; or endure DAY LONG development cycles: make 
a change, wait 24 hours, come back tomorrow, and try it again.  That&#x27;s 
how broken it was.


The best part about this was that we had a totally reasonable 
conversation about it.  It&#x27;s the kind of thing which had become a rare 
commodity in those days at that place.


Would I expect someone else to go to that level of insanity every single 
time they just want to get their job done?  Absolutely not.

Editing files in prod to develop them?  That&#x27;s bad news.  Deliberately 
rigging tunnels to spoof a connection from prod?  That&#x27;s also bad news.  
Having to do them to get your job done?  You might be in the bad place.</p>

                  <p>Quite a while back, I wrote a post that basically went like this: if 
someone has a problem with someone else or something that person is 
doing, they&#x27;re going to find a way to get to &quot;no&quot;.  They will find some 
reason, some excuse, or some problem with it.  They&#x27;ll bring up a point 
and you&#x27;ll show that this is not in fact a thing.  They will then pivot 
again and again.


But, as I said, that was back then, and this time I&#x27;m talking about 
something else: when it happens in person with a coworker.  I had an 
experience like this a few years back, and figured I&#x27;d share how it goes 
for the sake of others who might not have encountered it yet, or who 
have and thought they were alone in this.

                  <p>This is a short one since it&#x27;s somewhere between a random bit of 
&quot;grab some popcorn&quot; amusement and a &quot;huh, that might be a problem some 
day&quot;.  In short, it looks like every Raspberry Pi filesystem installed 
from any given release image probably ends up with the same
UUID.


For instance, if you downloaded the &quot;lite&quot; version of Raspbian between 
roughly November 8th and January 28th, you probably got a file called 
2021-10-30-raspios-bullseye-armhf-lite.zip.  Inside, there&#x27;s an image, 
and the idea is that you dump that straight to your SD card, cram it in 
the Pi, and off you go.  The second partition on that image is an ext4 
filesystem which was created on some build machine somewhere.  The UUID 
on it never gets &quot;evolved&quot; to something else after the install.


You can see it inside the image itself here:


Or, if you actually installed a few of these things like I did over the 
past couple of months, you can just &#x27;tune2fs -l /dev/mmcblk0p2&#x27; and see 
the same value in there.


Don&#x27;t end up with a pile of SD cards on your desk and think &quot;I know, 
I&#x27;ll use the filesystem UUIDs to track which one goes where&quot;, in other 
words.


If it&#x27;s not breaking anything for you, it&#x27;s probably best to just let it 
be.  Untangling a boot mess on these weird little boxes is anything but 
fun.

Note: if you&#x27;re actually on a recent Raspberry Pi, odds are good that 
your /etc/fstab will be using *partition* UUIDs (PARTUUID&#x3D;...) and not 
those of the filesystem.  If in doubt, use blkid to see what&#x27;s what.</p>

                  <p>There are some interesting implications to the way that you have to 
handle references to other bits of code when you write a C++ header 
file.  There are things you can do which turn out to be suboptimal, and 
until or unless you work someplace with a coding style document or get 
some mentor who&#x27;s already been there, you&#x27;re likely to make some
mistakes.


Anyway, a common way to do this is to set up the outer class such that 
it has a pointer to the inner one.  You *could* have it just own it 
directly, but then that introduces problems.

  Bar bar_;



Of course, bar.h probably has its own dependencies which get #included, 
and so now you end up with this evil web of slow compiles.  It sucks.


What used to happen next is that someone would say, okay, let&#x27;s make it

                  <p>Yesterday, I
put forth
a bunch of API possibilities for the problem of needing to return a 
value but also indicating the lack of a value and being able to comment 
on why.  In it, the notion of a &quot;wrapper&quot; around a string was presented, 
such that it might look like &quot;Result&quot;, and those brackets 
started looking like a pain.  There was also the possibility of having 
something like &quot;ResultString&quot;, but didn&#x27;t that open the door to having a 
bunch of code duplication?


After this had existed for a while, the general happy feeling of having 
this stuff in place became infectious.  I wanted it to cover other 
things with it, too.  I wanted it to handle something a bit more 
complicated than a mere string, and so decided to try my hand at the

                  <p>If you agree with the notion that you need to be able to tell the 
difference between the absence of a value and a value itself, then this 
has some impacts on the code you write.  If you want to keep &#x27;em 
separated (so they can come out and play), then it gets you looking at 
your API designs in certain ways.


Imagine we&#x27;re talking about a helper function that is intended to be run 
inside a program that&#x27;s handling the access to a web page.  It&#x27;s 
probably a CGI program, but it could also be buried inside some much 
bigger thing, too.  This is all about C++ styles, but you can probably 
see slices of other languages in here, too.

I mentioned taking my old Mac Mini out of the OS X/macos ecosystem and 
bringing it into Debian, and then what kind of hilarity followed when I 
attempted to install a Javascript linter (and it tried to drag in 180+ 
node-related packages).

teeny little libraries, all moving independently?  This is how it 
manifests in the real world.

delighted to discover that such and such has already been packaged up

has expanded.  Now it has a variant: 4740180.


Where does this one come from?  
Go and gRPC, apparently!


I found this while searching the web for &quot;1213486160&quot; to see how things 
have been going in the past few years.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s still biting 
people all over the place.  There are far too many posts asking people 
to upgrade their software, or restart things, or do any number of 
useless rubber-chicken-waving techniques which ultimately will 
accomplish nothing.

When you see a funny-looking number, figure out where it comes from.
That&#x27;s the only way to have any chance of understanding what&#x27;s actually 
going on.</p>

&quot;process infection&quot; story:

https://lwn.net/Articles/883547/):


If you do privileged execution of specific operations via IPC you get 
the guarantee that whatever is done, is done from a well-defined, 
pristine execution environment, without leaking context implicitly. The 
IPC message is the *full* vulnerable surface, and that&#x27;s as minimal as 
it can get. And that&#x27;s great.




Oh wow, thank you for mentioning that, unnamed reader!  I definitely 
read that post on LWN at some point in the past couple of days when the 
pkexec thing started going around.  It must have really worked its way 
into my head, and then eventually stirred up the memory of everything

                  <p>I once worked at a place that had an interesting little problem stemming 
from the way they managed machines and some of the fun side-effects 
processes can have on each other.  This is back in the pre-systemd days 
of running services, such that things tended to be started or restarted 
by someone or something that itself ran as root.  That is, if you 
started something, it might inherit one or more things from your 
environment.  Likewise, if you ran something with an unusual 
environment, it might bestow those &quot;gifts&quot; onto anything it happened to 
touch.


After locking themselves out of machines too many times, people 
generally learned that after you mess with a glibc upgrade, you restart 
the sshd listener on port 22.  Of course, they also had to learn to not

in a post all by itself to give it a chance to &quot;sink in&quot; before I went 
and used it in an analogy.  First, I&#x27;ll just show the image and explain 
what you&#x27;re looking at here.




I do remember the description from the back: this is a picture of *part 
of* something that was called the Software Creations BBS.  It was a 
multi-line bulletin board system where you could dial up and send 
messages to people, upload and download files, and (presumably) play 
online games (&quot;doors&quot;) and anything else they cared to offer.

64 machines in a little space.  I have to assume 
they are at least 
286s (ATs, more or 
less), but it&#x27;s impossible to tell from just this picture.  They could 
have been 386s or even 486s by that point, but ‚Ä¶</p>

posted
a picture of an old multi-line bulletin board system which had 
apparently taken over an entire bedroom with dozens of computers.  I 
mentioned that I intended to come back to the topic to throw in my own 
two cents, and so here we go.


Or, were you someone who found it horrific and wished there was a 
simpler way?  Did you wonder if it would be possible to pack all of that 
into one or maybe two boxes, instead?  Did you want a way to negate all 
of that complexity while still providing the same level of service?


Now, things are different.  I look at that and just sigh at the lost 
opportunities.  The actual amount of work being done on behalf of any of 
the users who are connected is tiny.  If we ignore the fact that the
