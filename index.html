                  <p>This is a nice thing to end the week on: Yo-Yo Ma playing ‚ÄúBach‚Äôs Pr√©lude from Suite No. 2, amidst the melting permafrost on Lower Tanana Dene lands in Fairbanks, Alaska.‚Äù He was brought to this birch forest by Princess Daazhraii Johnson, a member of the Neets‚Äôaii Gwich‚Äôin people, who wrote:
Our relationship to our birch relatives, our salmon relatives, and all the beings of Alaska are sacred. Our traditional stories tell us that at one point we all spoke the same language ‚Ä¶ we still do. If we find the time to truly listen, we might recognize ourselves in the melting permafrost or the fallen birch, but we might also recognize ourselves in the songs of the birds or the freshness of the Arctic breeze. There is still hope when we experience life. We should all fall in love with the places we live and let this love drive our determination to protect the waters, the salmon, the caribou, and all our plant relatives so that future generations may also experience such joy and sustenance.


Have a good weekend, everyone.

                  <p>This is great: a 25-minute interview with legendary animator Chuck Jones as he sits and draws some of his iconic characters (Bugs Bunny, Porky Pig, Daffy Duck). He told this anecdote about how Steven Spielberg and George Lucas were both influenced by a particular space-themed cartoon of his:
Porky was just a kind of a little third-string Boy Scout and was not very interesting to me. And then when I put him in a picture called Duck Dodgers in the 24th and a Half Century. Spielberg used that picture in Close Encounters the Third Kind - when his kids were watching television in the picture, they were watching Duck Dodgers in the 24th and a Half Century. And Lucas told me that he saw that picture when he was 12 years old and when when he opened Star Wars in San Francisco he told them they couldn‚Äôt have Star Wars in San Francisco unless they ran Duck Dodgers in the 24th and a Half Century.

                  <p>Absolutely essential reading and viewing on how to produce captions with valuable real world examples of how to completely mess it up (and a lot of social posted videos do the bad mess version).
As someone who&#x27;s hard of hearing and uses captions on all viewing media that I can, I already feel this.
Excellent post by Meryl Evans.

                  <p>The other day, the novelist Robin Sloan mentioned in his newsletter that he really liked the Financial Times. It seems everyone‚Äôs talking up the Financial Times lately, so I went and followed them on Instagram. 
The first post in their feed was for an essay by Janan Ganesh, about how although the American self-help industry makes it seems like most mistakes can be salvaged, many are in fact unsalvageable and life-destroying. An excerpt: 
The sur¬≠prise of middle age, and the ter¬≠ror of it, is how much of a per¬≠son‚Äôs fate can boil down to one mis¬≠judge¬≠ment.
Such as? What in par¬≠tic¬≠u¬≠lar should the young know? If you marry badly ‚Äî or marry at all, when it isn‚Äôt for you ‚Äî don‚Äôt assume the dam¬≠age is recov¬≠er¬≠able. If you make the wrong career choice, and real¬≠ise it as early as age 30, don‚Äôt count on a way back. ‚Ä¶ A big [mistake], or just an early one, can fore¬≠close all hope of the life you wanted.


At first I found it oddly cheering (if I can‚Äôt fix my mistakes, I might as well relax and accept my circumstances), but then I found it sad. (Does my husband feel like he made a life-destroying mistake by marrying me? LMAO.) Now I‚Äôm more like ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø because things can only ever go the way they go. Anyway, I‚Äôm not yet a FT subscriber, but it was a nudge.

                  <p>Here is a pleasantly painful trailer for a new movie from the filmmaker Joanna Arnow. It opens this Friday, April 26, at IFC and Lincoln Center in NYC. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm going to watch it, but I couldn‚Äôt really look away. 
Arnow also stars as‚Ä¶ 
an emotionally detached young Brooklynite drifting through unremarkable days and nights. Neither her on-again-off-again BDSM relationship with a mildly disinterested older dom, nor her nondescript corporate job, appear to bring her any satisfaction.


And yet ‚Äúshe finds a core of poignant truth about the ways people search for ‚Ä¶ emotional happiness and sexual gratification‚Äù (per the Lincoln Center summary). It‚Äôs currently at a 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, FWIW. (This bit also made me laugh out loud.)

                  <p>I think knitters are often fascinated by the fact that I use such tiny needles. Some of the needles are almost the dimension of a human hair.


Sublimely absurd, perfection. More info in Reactor. [Thanks, Tobias!]
And here‚Äôs another pic, grabbed from Crome‚Äôs website: 

I don‚Äôt know about you, but this makes me want to drop everything and disappear into the process of knitting a microscopic sweater for the next six months. Like her Starry Night one. 
Actually, the Starry Night sweater should just be its whole own post: 

‚ÄúI love the paradox of creating an object that takes the form of something you can wear,‚Äù Crome writes, ‚Äúyet is impossible to wear.‚Äù 
(Her work is also for sale.)

                  <p>I love this: The Pudding ran an online experiment where they started with a shape (like a straight line or circle) and asked people to trace, as best they could, the tracing of the person before them. This resulted in a series of ‚Äúflipbook‚Äù animation of how the shapes evolved over time ‚Äî invariably, a squiggle.

One thing I noticed right away was how all the squiggles ended up squished over on the right side of the screen. The Pudding team had a theory on why that happened (the 3:20 mark in this video):
I found this study from like 35 years ago - they were trying to figure out why people kept missing their targets on touch screens. They found people tended to touch below their target and people tended to touch closer to the edges of the screen. And so I figure if it‚Äôs like right-handers who are missing, you‚Äôre going to be missing to the right. We probably had about half the users on mobile and 90% of the those half are probably going to be right-handed so it would make sense that it would gradually go to the right.


Go read the rest of the post ‚Äî they also did an experiment about people‚Äôs inclination to draw penises on ‚Äúany free-form drawing project on the internet‚Äù. (via waxy)

                  <p>As someone who is interested in birds but doesn‚Äôt know a whole lot about them, this new animated video series from Will Rose is right up my alley. What Bird Is That? is a beginners guide to birding. The second episode, embedded above, is all about how to identify birds from their calls.
What‚Äôs that bird that sounds like Star Wars singing on my roof? What bird sings it‚Äôs own name? What‚Äôs that laughing sound you heard in the woods?


Right now, I ‚Äúcheat‚Äù by using Cornell Lab of Ornithology‚Äôs eBird app, which allows you to record a bit of birdsong and it‚Äôll ID the bird for you. (via the kid should see this)

                  <p>Steve Mould‚Äôs videos are always entertaining and informative but this one is also a little bit mind-blowing. If you build a circular trough with just the right dimensions and fill it with lighter fluid, a flame will travel around it. And other shapes will do other things ‚Äî the effect created by the star/octopus shape is especially cool. The effect is an example of an excitable medium:
An excitable medium is a nonlinear dynamical system which has the capacity to propagate a wave of some description, and which cannot support the passing of another wave until a certain amount of time has passed (known as the refractory time).
A forest is an example of an excitable medium: if a wildfire burns through the forest, no fire can return to a burnt spot until the vegetation has gone through its refractory period and regrown.


Other examples:
Normal and pathological activities in the heart and brain can be modelled as excitable media. A group of spectators at a sporting event are an excitable medium, as can be observed in a Mexican wave (so-called from its initial appearance in the 1986 World Cup in Mexico).

                  <p>In the spirit of recommending things I truly love, I wanted to highlight the pottery of Northern California artist Naja Tepe. I‚Äôve ordered from her twice now, and her work is fabulous. I love her strawberry-themed items, but the crescent moon on the plate in her most recent Instagram post (upper right in the composite above) made me want to have everything it appears on, too. Great for gifts. I don‚Äôt think my mom reads this site, so I will therefore reveal that I got her a Naja Tepe item for her birthday this year.

                  <p>Ok mountain bike nerds, I need your advice. Here‚Äôs my situation: I‚Äôve been riding for 3.5 years now on a Kona Honzo hardtail (which I really love) and am pondering a full-suspension bike purchase. They are $$$, but I want to do more riding this summer &amp; fall ‚Äî including some downhilling on some local lift-serviced trails here in VT (Bolton, Killington, Sugarbush, Burke) ‚Äî and it feels like it‚Äôs the right time to invest in an upgrade.
I would say I‚Äôm an intermediate rider (but more towards the beginner end of the spectrum than the expert end). I love flowy trails and can do small jumps and such, but I‚Äôm not super fast and am still learning how to turn properly in the berms. I‚Äôm never going to be a super aggressive rider but I‚Äôd like to progress. A lot of the stuff I ride is up and down, so I need something that climbs well (not looking for a downhill bike). I‚Äôm 6‚Äô and 155# if that matters. My Honzo is a large and has 29‚Äù wheels, which I like. I‚Äôve ridden a Kona Process 153 29 and that felt good, although maybe a little squishy (but maybe everything feels squishy after a hardtail).
There are good bike shops around here and I‚Äôm definitely going to talk to them about what I‚Äôm looking for, but I‚Äôm wondering if anyone out there has thoughts about brands (particularly those that are known for quality (and ones that aren‚Äôt)), what to look for, what to stay away from, etc. Should I buy used? If so, good places to buy used? (I know about Pinkbike.) Any help or advice is appreciated, either in the comments below or via email. Thanks!

I have only scratched the surface of this multi-article package, but I locked into this one immediately: We asked 80 artists and other creative people to tell us what they‚Äôre starting right now or hope to very soon.
Filmmaker Boots Riley:
I‚Äôm getting ready to start filming a feature I wrote about a group of professional female shoplifters who find a device called a situational accelerator that heightens the conflict of anything they shoot it at. I also have a sci-fi adventure: a janky, lo-fi epic space funk opera. My dream is to use the same crew and shoot the two movies back to back in Oakland, Calif. [where I live].

                  <p>Letterboxd asked Dune director Denis Villeneuve what his four favorite films were and he cheated and listed five (including 2001 and Blade Runner).
First of all, who knows how long Blade Runner has been on his top 5 (or even 10 or 20 list) but getting to do a sequel of one of your favorite films has to be unbelievably rewarding as a director.1
And I‚Äôm going to cheat as well here and list a number of other films that Villeneuve has publicly praised, courtesy of this piece from IndieWire: Vertigo, Children of Men, Downsizing (?), There Will Be Blood, Seven Samurai, The Beguiled, Jaws, and three Nolan films (Dunkirk, Inception, Tenet).

I was trying to think of what might be the equivalent to this for me and all I could come up with is getting hired to reboot Suck or something.‚Ü©

                  <p>Hey there everyone. As I quickly touched on over the weekend, I launched a few new tweaks/features for the comments here on kottke.org:
1. Ability to edit comments. After you post a new comment, you‚Äôve got 10 minutes to edit it ‚Äî to fix any typos, formatting slip-ups, or quick extra thoughts. After 10 minutes, the comment is locked. Edited comments are denoted by some text (‚ÄúEdited‚Äù) next to the timestamp of the comment and you can click on it to see the comment‚Äôs original text.
2. A (hopefully) less confusing posting interface. I still haven‚Äôt totally dialed this in, but the inline reply box wasn‚Äôt working, particularly when you tried replying to the last comment in a thread and then you had Dueling Comment Textareas but only one was the One True Textarea ‚Äî chaos. Now everything (posting,‚Ä¶</p>

                  <p>This weekend I was doing some programming work (comments, another small project) and listening to some old-school electronica (DJ-Kicks by Kruder &amp; Dorfmeister anyone?). When I write, I tend to listen to chill stuff so I can concentrate ‚Äî classical, vaporwave, soundtracks, Jon Hopkins, Sigur R√≥s, Tycho, Boards of Canada, things like that ‚Äî but when designing or programming, I need something faster with a beat to spur me onwards.
So anyway, I was about to switch from electronica to something by kottke.org favorites The Hood Internet when I thought to check their website to see if they‚Äôd released any new mixtapes. And lo ‚Äî they had (sorta). The Lost Mixtape is a 45-minute mix of music from circa 2005-2009, discovered on some dusty old hard drive and recently finished up &amp; released for our listening pleasure.

The bit at around 16:00 where they mix Milkshake and So Electric is just superb. You can find streaming options and a downloadable MP3 on their website.

                  <p>This had me cackling in laughter this morning: Kevin Del Aguila hamming it up in the wings off-stage while the show, Some Like It Hot, goes on. How on Earth did the actors not completely break during all of that?

The newsletter highlights kids‚Äô media ‚Äî ‚Äúthink Bluey, but stuff that isn‚Äôt Bluey‚Äù ‚Äî and so far the worst part is that I want to buy everything it recommends.
I also learned a lot from this installment on a song from the 2021 My Little Pony movie. (thx, Gillian!)

                  <p>Really fascinating piece by Michael Habib in Scientific American about how amazing feathers are: they come in so many different shapes and sizes and do so many things (insulate, keep dry, flying, noise dampening, etc. etc. etc.) And I loved the opening anecdote:
In October 2022 a bird with the code name B6 set a new world record that few people outside the field of ornithology noticed. Over the course of 11 days, B6, a young Bar-tailed Godwit, flew from its hatching ground in Alaska to its wintering ground in Tasmania, covering 8,425 miles without taking a single break. For comparison, there is only one commercial aircraft that can fly that far nonstop, a Boeing 777 with a 213-foot wingspan and one of the most powerful jet engines in the world. During its journey, B6-an animal that could perch comfortably on your shoulder-did not land, did not eat, did not drink and did not stop flapping, sustaining an average ground speed of 30 miles per hour 24 hours a day as it winged its way to the other end of the world.
Many factors contributed to this astonishing feat of athleticism-muscle power, a high metabolic rate and a physiological tolerance for elevated cortisol levels, among other things. B6‚Äôs odyssey is also a triumph of the remarkable mechanical properties of some of the most easily recognized yet enigmatic structures in the biological world: feathers. Feathers kept B6 warm overnight while it flew above the Pacific Ocean. Feathers repelled rain along the way. Feathers formed the flight surfaces of the wings that kept B6 aloft and drove the bird forward for nearly 250 hours without failing.

This day in history: 2004, 2009, 2019, 2023 Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I&#x27;ve been. Latest books: You keep readin&#x27; em, I&#x27;ll keep writin&#x27; &#x27;em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I&#x27;ll keep writin&#x27; &#x27;em. Colophon: All the rest. Precaratize bosses (permalink) Combine Angelou&#x27;s &quot;When someone shows you who they are, believe them&quot; with the truism that in politics, &quot;every accusation is a confession&quot; and you get: &quot;Every time someone accuses you of a vice, they&#x27;re showing you who they are and you should believe them.&quot; Let&#x27;s talk about some of those accusations.

‚Ä¶half a dozen varieties of loquat, four kinds of mulberry, carambola/starfruit, sweet oranges, Seville oranges, grapefruit, jackfruit, guava, grapes, apples, sweet tamarind, dried jujube, strawberries, blueberries, Mysore bananas, Rajapuri bananas, Cavendish bananas, green coconuts, homegrown pineapple, dried carambola, tangerine, dried sweet cherries, pomelo and more.


I‚Äôd love to have a fruitluck! Maybe I need to make a trip to Florida.

                  <p>[Voiceover]: The Nautilus had no heat or insulation ‚Äî nothing but bare metal separated them from the frigid Arctic waters. The crew were constantly sickened with food poisoning and dosed with lead from the soldering in the submarine‚Äôs pipes. Attempting the pole this late in the season would be extremely dangerous, and without exception everyone wanted to turn around and head home. Everyone except Wilkins.

I ‚Äúenjoyed‚Äù this stressful mini-documentary, from the Mustard Channel, about the ill-fated (but ‚Äî spoiler? ‚Äî not THAT ill-fated) 1931 attempt to reach the North Pole by submarine. [via The Browser]

                  <p>I‚Äôve been thinking about something I posted last week ‚Äî in an excerpt from his new book The Work of Art, former New York magazine editor Adam Moss described the art he makes as bad: ‚ÄúWhen I left my job, I began to paint more seriously,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúThat was the beginning of my torment: I just wasn‚Äôt very good.‚Äù Or as he put it to The New Yorker: ‚ÄúI kind of just wasn‚Äôt any good.‚Äù Or to Vanity Fair: ‚ÄúI really wanted to be a good painter. What a fucking idiot I was.‚Äù Or on NPR, ‚ÄúI really wanted to be good, and it made the act of making art so frustrating for me.‚Äù
The book is mostly about how other artists make their work, but I‚Äôm currently more interested in what Moss has to say about himself and his art. 
Later in the VF and NPR interviews, Moss says that the main lesson he learned from making the book is that with art, it‚Äôs the journey not the destination ‚Äî or, ‚Äúthe making, not the made‚Äù (‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the most banal observation‚Äù) ‚Äî but of course I still went looking for his paintings online. I want to see them! I didn‚Äôt find anything (per the VF article, he hasn‚Äôt shared anything publicly yet), but to Moss I say: Show them! Maybe it doesn‚Äôt matter if they‚Äôre not good. Maybe the worse, the better.

                  <p>A family of beavers in Canada has built a dam that‚Äôs twice as wide as the Hoover Dam. This huge dam is kind of a click-baity promotion (it worked!) but the essence of the video is how beavers can help make landscapes more resilient to effects of climate change.
It‚Äôs so big it can be seen from outer space. But that‚Äôs not the only reason NASA is interested in this architecturally minded species‚Ä¶ Increasing diversity and resilience, not to mention creating wetlands, are just some of the impacts beavers can have on their surroundings. What does this mean for the wider environment? And how can we humans learn from it?

                  <p>Several years ago in the Guardian, Oliver Burkeman wrote a piece called This column will change your life: Helsinki Bus Station Theory. It‚Äôs about how difficult it can be as a creative person to find your way to making work that feels like it‚Äôs uniquely yours.
There are two dozen platforms, Minkkinen explains, from each of which several different bus lines depart. Thereafter, for a kilometre or more, all the lines leaving from any one platform take the same route out of the city, making identical stops. ‚ÄúEach bus stop represents one year in the life of a photographer,‚Äù Minkkinen says. You pick a career direction ‚Äî maybe you focus on making platinum prints of nudes ‚Äî and set off. Three stops later, you‚Äôve got a nascent body of work. ‚ÄúYou take those three years of work on the nude to [a gallery], and the curator asks if you are familiar with the nudes of Irving Penn.‚Äù Penn‚Äôs bus, it turns out, was on the same route. Annoyed to have been following someone else‚Äôs path, ‚Äúyou hop off the bus, grab a cab‚Ä¶ and head straight back to the bus station, looking for another platform‚Äù. Three years later, something similar happens. ‚ÄúThis goes on all your creative life: always showing new work, always being compared to others.‚Äù What‚Äôs the answer? ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs simple. Stay on the bus. Stay on the fucking bus.‚Äù

                  <p>Edith here. For the next installment of my newish illustrated column here on Kottke dot org, I talked to my friend Nick Catucci. Nick edits the excellent newsletter Embedded, which partially inspired me to start this column. (Specifically, Embedded has an interview series called My Internet that I‚Äôve always loved.) Nick is also site director at GQ. And about 13 years ago the two of us worked at Vulture together.
Hey Nick! Have you read (watched, listened to, or otherwise experienced) anything good recently?
I think I speak for my demographic when I say that the new Waxahatchee album, Tigers Blood, is a dream. My friends at Pitchfork published a great profile of Katie by Andy Cush where she‚Äôs really insightful about how, being sober, she‚Äôs drawing from a different well than heroes of hers l‚Ä¶</p>

                  <p>This is a teenager is an interactive data visualization by Alvin Chang about a group of American teenagers that have been tracked in a longitudinal study since 1997 (they are around 40 years old now). The video version of the visualization is embedded above.
A year from now, in 1998, a researcher named Vincent Felitti will publish a paper that drastically changes the way we think about these kids ‚Äî and their childhood.
The research will show that these childhood stressors and traumas ‚Äî called Adverse Childhood Experiences ‚Äî have a lifelong effect on our health, relationships, happiness, financial security, and pretty much everything else that we value. It will kickstart decades of research that shows that our childhood experiences shape our adulthood far more than we ever thought.


This is a good companion to a recent post, End-Stage Poverty Is Killing People in Safety Net-Free America.

                  <p>Digital toys let us explore a possibility space where art can pulsate, move, degrade, and do strange things with each brush stroke.
I often talk about what a missed opportunity it is that mainstream digital art tools are so caught up in making the perfect pencil line, or imitating exactly how chalk or water colors work, when there&#x27;s other types of lines we can invent that would never be able to exist in the real world.</p>

Or your company has just implemented a personalization engine. Either way, you‚Äôre designing with data. Now what? When it comes to designing for personalization, there are many cautionary tales, no overnight successes, and few guides for the perplexed.¬†
Between the fantasy of getting it right and the fear of it going wrong‚Äîlike when we encounter ‚Äúpersofails‚Äù in the vein of a company repeatedly imploring everyday consumers to buy additional toilet seats‚Äîthe personalization gap is real.

                  <p>From Factory Monster (great name), a video of how candles are made in a South Korean candle factory. I like that there‚Äôs no music or voiceover, so you can hear the sounds of the production. I also enjoyed the charmingly janky English subtitles:
Blah blah powder for hardness. Yellow powder for pure white color. Irony, huh?!


Can someone who knows something about making candles tell me why that hole is made in each of the candles with the metal rods? It was unclear from the video what its purpose is.
If you‚Äôd like to ruin/enhance the rest of your day, Factory Monster has a trove of making-of videos shot in Korean factories and workshops: retreading old tires, distressed jeans, chain link fences, customized Vans sneakers, and making a knife from an old motorcycle chain.

On June 30, 1973, Concorde 001 intercepted the path of a solar eclipse over North Africa, Flying at Mach 2.05 the aircraft provided seven observers from France, Britain and the United States with 74 min of totality bounded by extended second (7 min) and third (12 min) contacts.

                  <p>I‚Äôd missed that Philip Glass Solo (previously) came out in January, but I‚Äôve been listening to it while I work this morning and it‚Äôs just lovely. He recorded the album in his home on his piano. Here‚Äôs a short video of Glass playing on that very piano:

This is my piano, the instrument on which most of the music was written. It‚Äôs also the same room where I have worked for decades in the middle of the energy which New York City itself has brought to me. The listener may hear the quiet hum of New York in the background or feel the influence of time and memory that this space affords. To the degree possible, I made this record to invite the listener in.


And here‚Äôs a video of him playing the album‚Äôs opening piece on his 87th birthday:

You can stream the album on Spotify, Apple Music, or Bandcamp.

You can buy the album at Bandcamp or on vinyl at Amazon.

                  <p>When emperor penguin chicks go for their first swim, they usually jump a few feet into the sea. The group of chicks in the video National Geographic video above decided to leap off of a 50-foot ice cliff for their first trip out.
It‚Äôs not unusual for emperor penguin chicks to march toward the ocean at a young age, even when they‚Äôre just 6 months old. They jump just 2 feet off the ice to take their first swim, according to National Geographic. 
Others have jumped from a much a higher altitude, heading to ‚Äúsheer ice cliffs‚Äù knowingly to make the first jump. Satellites have recorded the death-defying jumps since 2009, but what happens next has remained a mystery until now.


Having watched the video, ‚Äúleap‚Äù and ‚Äújump‚Äù are charitable descriptions of what the penguins are doing here. ‚ÄúFlop‚Äù, ‚Äúplop‚Äù, and ‚Äúfall‚Äù might be better‚Ä¶penguins are all kinds of cool, but no one has ever accused them of being graceful out of the water.

                  <p>My current natural obsession is Mount Etna, a volcano in Sicily that blows perfect smoke rings like it‚Äôs frickin‚Äô Gandalf with a pipe-full of Old Toby or something.
It is a relatively rare phenomenon caused by a constant release of vapours and gases. The gaseous mass ascends rapidly through the central part of the conduit, promoting the formation of rings by wrapping the gas upon itself in a vortex motion.


Puff on, Etna, puff on.

                  <p>This is wonderful: a collection of video clips of Charles Schulz drawing his iconic Peanuts comic strip ‚Äî ‚Äúeverything I could find of Charles Schulz drawing his Peanuts characters‚Äù in the words of the compiler.
Unfortunately, I‚Äôm not highly educated. I‚Äôm merely a high school graduate. I studied art in a correspondence course because I was afraid to go to art school. I couldn‚Äôt see myself sitting in a room where everyone else in the room could draw much better than I and this way I was protected by drawing at home and simply mailing my drawings in and having them criticized.
I wish I had a better education but I think that my entire background made me well-suited for what I do. If I could write better than I can, perhaps I would have tried to become a novelist and I might have become a failure. If I could draw better than I can, I might have tried to become an illustrator or an artist and would have failed there. But my entire being seems to be just right for being a cartoonist.


Charles Schulz: Unbothered. Moisturized. Happy. In his lane. Focused. Flourishing.
See also a 90-minute compilation of cartoonists working (from the same YT channel) and Chuck Jones demonstrating how to draw Bugs Bunny and other characters. (via open culture)

I was browsing the excellent MDN to check something and came across both Map.groupBy and Object.groupBy. A handy static method for keying an array by some property (I&#x27;ll show working example in a moment).
Pretty useful, but I quickly realised that I&#x27;m very much stuck in the camp of the old dog not quite learning the new tricks.</p>

                  <p>record the same solar eclipse?! ‚Äî and how mind-blowing it is to even contemplate. We then talked about how crazy it must have been to live back then (in 790 AD) and see the sun just casually disappear, etc.
And then I was wondering: What‚Äôs happening now that people living in the year 3200 will pity us for not understanding? ‚ÄúWow, can you imagine living back then and not knowing exactly how [viruses appear/cancer strikes/the Voynich Manuscript came into existence]? Or precisely what happened at Dyatlov Pass, or on board the Mary Celeste?‚Äù (Okay now I‚Äôm just googling ‚Äúmysteries.‚Äù) Anyway, I‚Äôm not high, I swear. But please chime in if anything comes to mind. ‚ÄúIt must have been so weird to not know what dogs were saying.‚Äù

                  <p>Ok, one last post about the total solar eclipse and then I‚Äôm done talking about it. (Maybe.)
There are so many mind-blowing things about eclipses but the one I can‚Äôt stop thinking about is the nearly impossible coincidence that the sun and the moon are the same relative size in the sky. If the moon were a little bit smaller or farther away, we wouldn‚Äôt have total eclipses where you can look directly at the sun, see the corona, the sky goes dark, you see a sunset effect all around the horizon, etc. That is some spooky magical shit. Ted Underwood put it this way:
Random accident that the moon and sun are the same apparent size here. If we had interstellar tourism, this is the One Thing that everyone would know about the Earth, and when they visited they wouldn‚Äôt want to see anything else. ‚ÄúW‚Ä¶</p>

                  <p>It works! Three men stranded on a tiny Pacific island for more than a week were rescued after the Coast Guard spotted ‚ÄúHELP‚Äù written out on the beach in palm leaves. (A similar rescue from the same island happened in 2020 ‚Äî ‚ÄúSOS‚Äù that time.)

                  <p>Wonderful shots of the pyramids of Giza by Egyptian photographer Karim Amr. From a caption on one of his photos three years ago:
I‚Äôm a 21 years old photographer you can see a lot of photos I share at the pyramids cause I just live near the pyramids so it‚Äôs easy for me to go and shoot there. I started doing photography to share my thoughts with others it‚Äôs how I express my feelings it‚Äôs also my escape from life. Life is tough and not easy for some of us and you got to find your place in this world.


Prints of his photos are available and you can follow his work on Instagram.

                  <p>When I quit my magazine job, I decided to try my hand as an artist. ‚Ä¶ I got frustrated easily and gave up easily, never knowing when to persevere or surrender. ‚Ä¶

My curiosity is earthbound: Where do [artists] begin, and what do they do next, and when do they know they are finished? And more crucially: What do they do when they lose faith? Do they lose faith?

In an adaptation from his new book, The Work of Art: How Something Comes From Nothing, former New York magazine editor Adam Moss shares his interviews with Kara Walker, Louise Gl√ºck, and Cheryl Pope, about their respective creative processes [Vulture]. My favorite part is the intro, though, where he talks about his own process (‚Äúthat was the beginning of my torment‚Äù).
I‚Äôm hoping the answer to the ‚Äúpersevere or surrender‚Äù question is in there very explicitly, by the way!

                  <p>Let‚Äôs say the countries of the world most responsible for the changing climate continue to drag their feet on doing something about it. What is the world going to look like in 20 or 30 or 80 years? This TED-Ed video describes that bleak potential future.
Reports on heatwaves and wildfires regularly fill the evening news. Summer days exceed 40 degrees in London and 45 degrees in Delhi, as extreme heat waves are now 8 to 9 times more common. These high temperatures prompt widespread blackouts, as power grids struggle to keep up with the energy demands needed to properly cool homes. Ambulance sirens blare through the night, carrying patients suffering from heatstroke, dehydration, and exhaustion. The southwestern United States, southern Africa, and eastern Australia experience longer, more frequent, and more severe droughts.
Meanwhile, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Japan face more frequent heavy rainfall as rising temperatures cause water to evaporate faster, and trap more water in the atmosphere. As the weather becomes more erratic, some communities are unable to keep pace with rebuilding what‚Äôs constantly destroyed.

I mean, it was definitely neat. And we did get cute pictures. And it does sort of feel like a little gremlin has been set loose in my soul. But my neck was also sore the day after. Worth it???

error messages. I‚Äôve had many years to get used to these error messages so it
took me a really long time to understand why folks were confused, but having
thought about it much more, I‚Äôve realized that:
sometimes I actually am confused by the error messages, I‚Äôm just used to
being confused
I have a bunch of strategies for getting more information when the error
message git gives me isn‚Äôt very informative
So in this post, I‚Äôm going to go through a bunch of Git‚Äôs error messages,
list a few things that I think are confusing about them for each one, and talk
about what I do when I‚Äôm confused by the message.
improving error messages isn‚Äôt easy

                  <p>David Lynch is not having any of that ‚Äúyou need to struggle or be tortured in order to be creative‚Äù stuff. In this video compilation, the director talks about how poor mental health inhibits art &amp; creativity.

It stands to reason: the more you suffer, the less you want to create. If you‚Äôre truly depressed, they say you can‚Äôt even get out of bed, let alone create. It occupies the whole brain, poisons the artist, poisons the environment; little room for creativity.


Open Culture has more on how Lynch uses transcendental meditation to improve his mental health‚Ä¶and a great anecdote about the one time Lynch tried therapy:
In one Charlie Rose interview, a clip from which appears in the video, he even tells of the time he went to therapy. The beginning of this story makes it in, but not the end: Lynch asked his new therapist ‚Äústraight out, right up front, ‚ÄòCould this process that we‚Äôre going to go through affect creativity?‚Äô And he said, ‚ÄòDavid, I have to be honest with you, it could‚Äù ‚Äî whereupon Lynch shook the man‚Äôs hand and walked right back out the door.

Mistigram: this Spring has already been a pretty magical season, what with the appearance of the Easter eggs, Christ‚Äôs resurrection and that business with the eclipse, and capping it all off, today is National #Unicorn Day!

                  <p>The writer Amanda Fortini tweeted something a couple weeks ago that I haven‚Äôt stopped thinking about: 
Years ago, when I was in my 20s, a bold and artistically daring older friend who has since passed on gave me what I often think was the best advice I have ever gotten. I was worrying what ‚Äòpeople would think‚Äô of a decision I had made, and she said, ‚ÄúAmanda, There is no audience.‚Äù


The tweet went viral, so this probably isn‚Äôt news to a lot of readers. But I‚Äôve been saying it to myself ever since: Amanda, there is no audience. Somehow, for a few seconds at a time, it makes sense to me on a very deep level. The ‚ÄúAmanda‚Äù part seems essential, too, for whatever reason.

I didn‚Äôt have to go chasing all over tarnation this time, the telescope worked out amazingly well, and I got to share it with a bunch of first-timers, both in-person and via text. I‚Äôm going to share some thoughts, photos, and videos from others around the internet in an even bloggier fashion than usual. Here we go.
My pal Noah Kalina got one of my favorite shots of the day (see also):

Gobsmacking shot from Rami Ammoun‚Ä¶it‚Äôs a blend of multiple exposures so you can see the sun and moon at the same time. Love this shot.

And another stunner from Andrew McCarthy:

                  <p>Hey, gang. Today is the solar eclipse, it‚Äôs supposed to be mostly sunny here in Colchester, VT, we‚Äôve got 3 minutes and 16 seconds of totality to enjoy, and I built a solar filter for my telescope (and binoculars!), so kottke.org is going to take the day off. Edith and I will see you back here tomorrow.
In the meantime, are you doing anything for the eclipse? Anyone got any crazy camera/telescope setups? Do you think Instagram is going to crash this afternoon? Will I completely lose my mind if a cloud drifts in front of the sun today at 3:26pm ET? Is it a coincidence or a miracle that we happen to be alive during the relatively brief period of time when the moon almost exactly covers the sun, resulting in total solar eclipses? Could you imagine if the eclipse somehow doesn‚Äôt happen today??!

                  <p>From the Center for Research on Vermont at UVM, a pair of eclipse glasses from 1932. I found a product listing for these ‚Äî they were marketed as the Eclipse-O-Scope and sold for 10¬¢.
VPR‚Äôs Nina Keck recently interviewed Floyd Van Alstyne, who is currently 104 but was 12 years old during the 1932 eclipse:
KECK: It was in the middle of the depression, he reminds me. And while he learned about the eclipse in his one-room schoolhouse, he doesn‚Äôt recall too much hoopla surrounding it.
F VAN ALSTYNE: I don‚Äôt know. We didn‚Äôt think much about general things in those days like they do now. Or we thought about minding their own business, I guess.

                  <p>In 1900, celebrated magician (and astronomy enthusiast) Nevil Maskelyne travelled to North Carolina to film a solar eclipse on May 28, 1900. The Royal Astronomical Society and the British Film Institute reckon this is ‚Äúthe first surviving astronomical film in the world‚Äù.
In 1898 he travelled to India to photograph an eclipse. He succeeded but the film can was stolen on his return journey home. 
It was not an easy feat to film. Maskelyne had to make a special telescopic adapter for his camera to capture the event. This is the only film by Maskelyne that we know to have survived.
The original film fragment held in The Royal Astronomical Society‚Äôs archive has been painstakingly scanned and restored in 4K by conservation experts at the BFI National Archive, who have reassembled and retimed the film frame by frame. The film is part of BFI Player‚Äôs recently released Victorian Film collection, viewers are now able to experience this first film of a solar eclipse since the event was originally captured over a century ago.

                  <p>This could be an SNL sketch! ‚Äî but it‚Äôs also delightful. It‚Äôs a trailer for The Sound of Knitting, ‚Äúan evening where classical music and knitting merge.‚Äù The popular designers and podcasters Arne &amp; Carlos teamed up with the Norwegian string instrument group (heh) Trondheimsolistene to make a concert/tutorial/behind-the-scenes knitting video, available for purchase. In addition to featuring knitting-friendly music, the video includes a tour of the Norwegian municipality of Selbu, famous for its gorgeous mittens, as well as a virtual class on how to knit those mittens. It all seems lovely, although I confess I was slightly disappointed that ‚Äúthe sound of knitting‚Äù wasn‚Äôt an ASMR video of needles clicking, although I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs out there, too. I mean, I know it is because I‚Äôve seen it.
Plus, as a recent NY Times story outlined, handwork is good for the brain.

                  <p>I‚Äôve always been intrigued by the ‚ÄúJolene‚Äù lyrics (are they mature or are they insane?), so I was excited to hear Beyonc√©‚Äôs version. Ultimately those lyrics didn‚Äôt really speak to me, but then I came across novelist Sonora Jha‚Äôs twist on the ‚ÄúJolene‚Äù lyrics on Instagram, and I felt an itch had been scratched. I‚Äôve transcribed those lyrics below ‚Äî her original post is here.
(With apologies to Dolly and Beyonc√©)

You‚Äôre beautiful beyond compare

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love my man I love those kids as hard I can

You say you don‚Äôt want him no more

Scott E Fahlman suggests a use of :) and :( in September, 1982. This happened on a bulletin board at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, USA.¬†It caught on pretty fast, and in November there were already several variations.

There are many¬†earlier examples of smilies, but this is likely what popularized emoticons as we know them today.

                  <p>Rob MacInnis takes these great family photos of farm animals. I mean, gold medal to anyone who can actually get a chicken, dog, goat, sheep, cow, and horse to pose together like that. I also like his photo of this charming sheep.
You can check out more of his work on Instagram and his website. (via present &amp; correct)

                  <p>This is a fascinating article by Kathleen DuVal about how climate change (including the Little Ice Age) affected social and political structures in North America in the 13th and 14th centuries.

                  <p>Edith here. For the second installment of my illustrated interview column, I talked with my friend, the poet Jim Behrle. He visited us recently, so I used a photo I took in person as reference for the portrait. Jim‚Äôs latest book of poems is called Hoetry, and you can catch him hosting Bad Animals on WFMU on Mondays 8-9pm. He‚Äôs also on Instagram. 
Have you read, watched, or otherwise experienced anything good recently?

                  <p>As usual, XKCD is spot on with this graph of solar eclipse coolness as a function of distance from the path of totality. The image‚Äôs alt text reads:
A partial eclipse is like a cool sunset. A total eclipse is like someone broke the sky.


See also the 2017 version. After witnessing the 2017 total solar eclipse, I wrote:
We saw the Baily‚Äôs beads and the diamond ring effect. And then‚Ä¶sorry, words are insufficient here. When the Moon finally slipped completely in front of the Sun and the sky went dark, I don‚Äôt even know how to describe it. The world stopped and time with it.

                  <p>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart‚Äôs first surviving musical composition was created at age five and in this video visualization, you can hear and see how his music evolved from that early piece to those created in his 20s and 30s. Not knowing a whole lot about music or of Mozart in particular, I was shocked at how incredible his compositions were at ages five, six, and seven. Sheesh.

                  <p>It‚Äôs been about five years since scientists captured the first blurry image of a black hole.

The process of collecting the data for these images is interesting:
The only way to ‚Äúsee‚Äù a black hole is to image the shadow created by light as it bends in response to the object‚Äôs powerful gravitational field. As Ars Science Editor John Timmer reported in 2019, the EHT isn‚Äôt a telescope in the traditional sense. Instead, it‚Äôs a collection of telescopes scattered around the globe.

                  <p>In this Crash Course video, author and ‚ÄúTB-hater‚Äù John Green takes a deep dive into tuberculosis.
This is the story of the deadliest infectious disease of all time. It‚Äôs been with us for 3 million years, since before humans were homo sapiens. We have evidence of it in the mummies of ancient Egypt, and it‚Äôs mentioned in the Hebrew Bible.
We‚Äôve made extraordinary medical advances. Vaccines, antibiotics, and clean water have saved millions of lives. And yet despite that, in 2022, this disease killed more people than malaria, typhoid, cholera, homicide, and war‚Ä¶combined.
It has gone by many names. In ancient China, it was known as huaifu, meaning ‚Äúdestroyed palace.‚Äù In ancient Hebrew, ‚Äúschachepheth,‚Äù meaning wasting away. The 19th-century term: ‚Äúconsumption,‚Äù for the way it seemed to consume the body. Today, we call it tuberculosis.

                  <p>COWEN: What is your most unusual successful work habit?
ROBINSON: I think it‚Äôs becoming used to the fact that it takes me a long time to get to the place where I can work on something ‚Äî that all this frustration [laughs] and depression that precedes my writing anything is part of the process of writing.


As someone who‚Äôs interested in finding God, I liked letting this religion-themed conversation wash over me. I also liked the idea that creative projects just have to take as long as they take and be as hard as they are. Robinson‚Äôs new book is about Genesis ‚Äî she calls the Bible ‚Äúthe most complex document on the planet‚Äù ‚Äî but in the interview they touch on several non-religious topics, too (like the above). Meanwhile I‚Äôm enjoying reading the negative reviews of her book on Amazon, which is probably bad (of me).

                  <p>I missed that Benjamin Labatut (When We Cease to Understand the World, üëçüëç) came out with a new novel last fall, The Maniac. The book centers on John von Neumann and the fuzzy, unstable, tech-centric world (atomics, AI) he and his colleagues created.

                  <p>I love Yuliya Krishchik‚Äôs space-themed embroidery pieces, especially the ones featuring Milky Way-like star fields ‚Äî she calls them ‚Äúsurreal space landscapes‚Äù. If you watch one of Krishchik‚Äôs videos, you can see that her pieces are just a bit 3D‚Ä¶a cool effect.
You can find more of her work on Instagram and her blog or buy original pieces in her store (they go quickly though).

                  <p>I noticed some tech bloggers I follow have been making April Cools Day posts about topics they don‚Äôt normally write
about (like decaf or microscopes). The goal isn‚Äôt to
trick anyone, just to write about something different for a day.
I thought those posts were fun so here is a post with some notes on learning to crochet tiny cacti.
first, the cacti
I‚Äôve been trying to do some non-computer hobbies, without putting a lot of
pressure on myself to be ‚Äúgood‚Äù at them. Here are some cacti I crocheted:

They are a little wonky and I like them.
a couple of other critters
Here are a couple of other things I made: an elephant, an orange guy, a
much earlier attempt at a cactus, and an in-progress cactus




Some of these are also pretty wonky, but sometimes it adds to the charm: for

                  <p>Hey everyone!
This is the list of all the changes we&#x27;ve done to our projects during the month of March.
Summary Of Changes
100r.co, added chainplates, knots, washing dishes, receiving mail, updated our notes on diy carbonation system, and refrigeration.
Uxn, added 2 new commands to Varvara&#x27;s System/expansion port and rewrote uxnasm.
Some toys, made a two-player implementation of Pong, and an orca that follows the cursor like that old classic flash web toy.
Left, improved the object inspector, it&#x27;s much prettier now!
Kokorobot has a new splash page.
News
Pino now has all-new chainplates! We removed the original ones earlier this month to inspect them and found some pit corrosion(as well as a small crack), replacing them was necessary. With the chainplates gone, we removed the entire starboard side cabinet to see what was behind it‚Äîit&#x27;s always nice to see parts of our boat we&#x27;ve never seen. We also replaced 3 old halyards on Pino. Devine earned themself a couple of blisters splicing dyneema onto some of our existing halyards.
Sejo revisited the Uxn tutorial, and appended corrections. The most important change is that the tutorial is now targeting the learn-uxn platform(online) maintained by metasyn. Now, people can jump right in and experiment without having to set up a dev environment. Tsoding, someone who can code in front of the camera in a language they&#x27;ve never used or read the docs for, did a pretty funny session in Uxntal, you can watch it here.
There has been too many exciting Uxn projects coming out these past few days, so we&#x27;ll just put a link to the hashtag. Someone also created a Discord channel, it&#x27;s a good place to learn about other concatenative languages and an alternative for people who have trouble with #uxn, in irc.libera.chat.
Pino book &amp; movie club
This month we are reading The Last Great Sea by Terry Glavin, and we watched the movie Tenet.

                  <p>This year, the React team unveiled something they&#x27;ve been quietly researching for years: an official way to run React components exclusively on the server. This is a significant paradigm shift, and it&#x27;s caused a whole lot of confusion in the React community. In this tutorial, we&#x27;ll explore this new world, and build an intuition for how it works, and how we can take advantage of it.</p>

                  <p>For so many React devs, styled-components seems kinda magical. It isn&#x27;t at all clear how it uses traditional CSS features under-the-hood, and that lack of clarity can cause real problems when things go awry. In this post, we&#x27;ll learn exactly how styled-components works by building our own mini-version.</p>

                  <p>Ryan Williams is an Australian scooter and BMX rider who does wild tricks that make me nervous. In 2013 he perfected a back flip with a nothing front scooter flip, which means he does a backflip while his scooter does a front flip, and then he spent about 10 years trying to get it done on a bike. Travis Pastrana dubbed it the Free Willy. Below is an example of a slightly different trick where he does a front flip instead of a backflip, except this one is easy because he can kind of see where the bike is. Easy. This one‚Äôs the easy one.

Here‚Äôs a behind the scenes of what it took him to figure out the Free Willy. At 1:40 you can see the first time he does it successfully on a scooter, and about 6:35 is when he gets it on the bike. Incredible stuff.

Williams won a gold with this trick at the 2023 X Games, obviously.

                  <p>I love books a bunch, mostly contemporary fiction and sometimes non-fiction, and I thought it would be fun if we had a comments thread about books you like or don‚Äôt like or want to read? Maybe you‚Äôll get a suggestion for something you‚Äôd like to read.
Here are some books I‚Äôve loved the last few years:
Harlem Shuffle and Crooks Manifesto by Colson Whitehead

Heaven and Earth Grocery and Deacon King Kong and The Good Lord Bird by James McBride

Final Revival of Opal and Nev by Dawnie Walton

Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow by Gabrielle Zevin

Sellout by Dan Ozzi

Gone to the Wolves by John Wray

This year I‚Äôve really liked: 
North Woods by Daniel Mason

Wellness by Nathan Hill

Biography of X by Catherine Lacey (I actually can‚Äôt decide if I liked this or if I just want to talk to people about it. I hated all the characters.)

The Rachel Incident by Caroline O‚ÄôDonoghue 

Running the Light by Sam Tallent

Favorites of all time!!
Undermajordomo Minor by Nick deWitt and 

Gentleman in Moscow by Amor Towles. (The long awaited TV adaptation of GiM with Ewan McGregor starts today on Showtime.)

Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen

Also, what do you think about a Kottke.org book club? Let‚Äôs do a bookclub, right? I‚Äôm not really sure how it would work except for probably we‚Äôd all read the same book at around the same time and then probably we‚Äôd all gather somewhere on this website and talk about the book, probably in a comments thread, though it remains to be seen. Comment down below if y‚Äôall are interested and Jason‚Äôs gonna come back from vacation and I‚Äôll say, ‚ÄúSurprise, buddy, now youse got a book club!‚Äù and then we‚Äôll go from there. 
What have you been reading?

                  <p>This article about the pandemic-fueled of homemade rise of chilito candy sold by social media has been in my tab attic since 2021 just waiting around to be shared because I‚Äôm a sucker for the journalistic arts applied to candy. I introduced my kids to Taj√≠n-coated peach gummies after a trip to Oakland in 2018, and my two year called them Fire Cheerios because all round foods were Cheerios then. Taj√≠n is also good on mango ice cream, or anything really. 
Mexican chilito candies, or dulces enchilados, have been making the mouths of Texans pucker for at least as long as we‚Äôve been hitting pi√±atas. A colloquial catchall for a variety of sweets, chilito refers to the spice of chamoy, a traditional Mexican paste made from pickled fruits and spices.

                  <p>Tiger Tail ice cream is an orange ice cream with black licorice swirls generally only found in Canada (until this summer when you can get it in Somerville after I make it even though I‚Äôm not very good at swirling).
A ribbon of black licorice swirled into an orange-flavored ice cream base gives this tiger its stripes. The old-school flavor sold well in soda parlors from the 1950s to the 1970s, and many Canadians now consider it a childhood classic. As curious as it may seem, kids (and nostalgic adults) are among the biggest fans of the citrus and black licorice combination.

Tigers Blood sorbet is a sorbet with strawberry, coconut, and watermelon, and maybe we‚Äôll make that one, too. 
Depending on who you ask, Tiger‚Äôs Blood could have originated as early as the 1940s or as late as the 1990s and was invented anywhere from Hawaii to Texas. Regardless of what the true story is, it‚Äôs safe to say that its creation was a success as it remains incredibly popular across the country.




Tigers Blood is also the name of the new album by Waxahatchee. 

On Tigers Blood, no bond is linear or static. Some of these songs sound ready to run, bursting from the traps; others take their ease with intoxicating beauty. Love boomerangs and comes back. Sisters have an unexpected showdown about their respective heady and cautious approaches to life. 



See how it‚Äôs all come together now?

It also has a huge snail heart because ‚Äúto accommodate the oxygen needs of symbiotic bacteria that live in their bodies and provide most of their nutrition.‚Äù 
Longtime Kottke readers will remember my friend Chris Piascik who drew this metal snail after I told him about the other metal snail. Chris has an excellent YouTube channel where he talks about stuff I can‚Äôt really understand in an engaging and delightful way. In 2018, Chris and I spent about 6 months working together and putting out a kids‚Äô book and he was mad at me every single day.

                  <p>Ooops, guess we‚Äôre doing two tonight. Goodness. Compare this to the video from last night. Tyshawn Jones is just getting so much speed up for these tricks. It‚Äôs like a different sport. Both so great to watch.

Saw a quote from Tyshawn Jones where he said he grew up watching this Andrew Reynolds - Baker 3 video and you can see the similarities in the size/speed of the tricks. (Frontside flips at :30 and 4:45ish, hooo boy.)

                  <p>Well, Fabio Wibmer is very, very fast on his bicycle. Just about the first trick in here is Fabio successfully jumping the Lyon 25 Stair we learned about earlier this week. And, uh, he does something we didn‚Äôt see in that other video because if you make it to the end of the video, you‚Äôll see he starts from the set of stairs going down to the Lyon 25 instead of starting on the flat like everyone else. Sheesh.
I also like how he takes the corner/curb at :50 and the stairs at 3:20 and the stairs at 5:15. Sheesh.

                  <p>A conversation at dinner with the kids left me wanting to know how to rhyme in sign language and when I found out, it feels like it should have been obvious. 
In phonology (the study of the smallest units of language), the parts of a signed word are: handshape, location, palm orientation, movement, and non-manual signal. They are called parameters. Each parameter has a number of primes. In sign language specifically ASL, the same parameter in two or more words (signs) are repeated. The parts may be the same handshape, movement, and/or location, or combined, but the handshape rhyme is the most commonly used.




And here‚Äôs an example of ASL poetry where you can clearly see the rhymes and music of the words in her poem. The poet, Christine Marshall, didn‚Äôt caption the poem and suggested viewers suggest a translation in the comments. The pinned translation is below.

                  <p>Dolly Parton‚Äôs ‚ÄòI Will Always Love You‚Äô was released 50 years ago a couple weeks ago and it‚Äôs a very good song. We all know Parton famously wrote IWALY and Jolene on the same day, which, like, one time I made 4 batches of ice cream and packed them all into pints and cleaned the machine all in an hour and forty five minutes and that‚Äôs kind of the same thing if you squint. She wrote the song to let Porter Wagoner know she was leaving his show and striking out on her own and that makes me mad because imagine working with someone so annoying you have to write one of the best songs ever written to get out of it. 
The year after it was released, Elvis was going to record it, but Tom Parker, his manager, insisted on half the publishing rights and Dolly said no, like a G. The whole germ for this post, my entire reason for being at this moment, was seeing that fact about Elvis and knowing Dolly teases IWALY not once, not twice, but, well, OK, only twice, on her duets album. It‚Äôs on Wrecking Ball, and she teases it AND sings about the whole episode on I Dreamed About Elvis. Priscilla Presley told Dolly Elvis loved the song so much and sang it to her on the day of their divorce. I do wish we could hear an Elvis recording of IWALY.
Dolly rerecorded the song for Best Little Whorehouse in Texas, but when Whitney covered IWALY, Dolly called it ‚ÄúOne of the biggest thrills and one of the most overwhelming feelings I‚Äôve ever had about anything in my life,‚Äù but that almost didn‚Äôt happen, too, twice, because they were going to do ‚ÄòWhat Becomes of the Broken Hearted‚Äô before that song got featured in Steel Magnolias (starring Dolly, wtf) and then Whitney was set to cover the Linda Ronstadt version which leaves off a verse at the end, but Dolly interceded at the last moment to set them straight.
Finally, my bar in Cambridge has a Dolly Parton-themed bathroom which has 5 stars on google maps and was written up in the New York Times.

Listen, I get it, you don‚Äôt get to be President of The Punxsutawney Groundhog Club Inner Circle by being normal about groundhogs, but it feels a little culty to me.
To wit:
‚ÄúHe added that Phil‚Äôs children will not inherit his seer of seers or prognosticator abilities because, simply, there‚Äôs only one Phil.‚Äù Bro, what? Why wouldn‚Äôt the children inherit the mirth?
‚Äú[Phil] receives a special elixir to extend his life.‚Äù (Dunkel is at least better than the previous president who said in 2020 Phil was 134 years old, able to live forever because of the elixir, while Dunkel smartly refused to age the groundhog. (wood)Chuck Everlasting imo.)

                  <p>At the beginning of this documentary, the narrator says something about ‚Äúhow did whales end up in the ocean,‚Äù and to be honest that fucked me up because whales make sense to me if I think of them as something that‚Äôs always been in the ocean, and if I have to reorient my mind around the fact that maybe they used to not be in the ocean, I‚Äôve got to re-think a lot of things. On the other hand, the documentary is called When Whales Could Walk, so that‚Äôs on me. I should have seen that coming. I did that to myself. And now I‚Äôm doing it to you.
This fossil graveyard, millions of years old, is known as the ‚ÄúValley of the Whales.‚Äù Now, paleontologists have unearthed a whole new species of ancient whale dating to 43 million years ago, and this predator wasn‚Äôt just able to swim ‚Äì it also had four legs and could walk.

which git commands/workflows people use (like ‚Äúdo you use merge or rebase more?‚Äù or ‚Äúdo you put your current git branch in your shell prompt?‚Äù)
what kinds of problems people run into with git (like ‚Äúhave you lost work because of a git problem in the last year or two?‚Äù)
which terminology people find confusing (like ‚Äúhow confident do you feel that you know what HEAD means in git?‚Äù)
how people think about various git concepts (‚Äúhow do you think about git branches?‚Äù)
in what ways my usage of git is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and in what ways it‚Äôs ‚Äúweird‚Äù. Where am I pretty similar to the majority of people, and where am I different?

                  <p>I like the skate videos where the skaters show how high or fast or far they can go and the control they have over their bodies while flying through the air, but I also like the videos where the skaters put their feet on the ground sometimes and use the board as more than something to ride on, as a prop. Gou Miyagi does a lot of tricks like that, riding up to a set of steps, running up the rail, sliding down on his butt, and landing on the board, and skating off, things of that nature. It all looks very nice.

It‚Äôs been feeling a little stale lately, because after three years I think I finally told all my tour stories so I wanted to do something new. 
The new thing is Road Snacks, a semi-regular feature where an ice cream shop interviews a touring musician asking questions about the food situation on tour. I think it‚Äôs changed a lot and probably not too much since I was doing it. The first interview ran today featuring Cary Ann Hearst f‚Ä¶</p>

                  <p>Hey, real quick, what‚Äôs something you always wanted to do, but only just started to learn how to do in the last year? I always wanted to learn how to play guitar and last year my son and I started taking guitar lessons together and now I can sort of play guitar a little.
If you‚Äôre trying to convince yourself to learn something you should just do it because you might still be shitty at whatever you‚Äôre learning 6 months from now, but you‚Äôll be much better than you‚Äôd be if you didn‚Äôt start until 6 months from now. I think I saw someone say this more eloquently (obviously), but when I tried to find it, all I could find was someone saying imagine if you started 6 months ago, which I think is a recipe for making yourself feel bad, and I bet you don‚Äôt need any help doing that, do you?
So, what‚Äôd you learn how to do this year or if you haven‚Äôt learned anything new yet, what are you going to start learning how to do this year?

                  <p>This 2013 Kings of Leon cover of Robyn‚Äôs Dancing on My Own inspired Callum Scott to sing Dancing on My Own for his audition for Britain‚Äôs Got Talent, which eventually lead to Scott‚Äôs version of the song hitting #2 on the UK charts in 2016 and becoming the #1 download in the UK that summer. The original version topped out at 8. 

Here‚Äôs the original.


Here‚Äôs a country version.


Here‚Äôs a punk cover validating my theory stating pop songs usually sound good as punk songs.

Anyway, I was thinking about this because a few years ago I made a playlist for the kids of all the covers of Dancing on My Own I could find and there were 56 back then. Today I added all the ones which were added to Apple Music in the last few years and now there are 91 total on the list, though 2 or 3 are remixes.

                  <p>I get furious every spring there isn‚Äôt an iced tea soda because I just want to try it once even though I know it would probably be terrible and we have chocolate milk soda and I can‚Äôt get iced tea soda? It‚Äôs madness is what it is. 
The lack of iced tea soda is only an aside to the main news of this post, offered as preamble, because you can‚Äôt really just jump into something like hot dog seltzer water without some sort of sweetener, some sort of softening the ground ahead of the news, an amuse bouche if you will. 
I‚Äôm pretty angry about this because it‚Äôs probably an April Fools joke announced early and corporations fucking lie all the time, but the least they could do is not pre-announce an April Fools joke. Now that April Fools has been coopted by try-hard brands, uh, trying too hard, a really good and cool thing for a brand to do would be to announce something what seems like a joke on April Fools and then actually deliver. No more phony bologna. If the Big Bite Hot Dog Sparkling Water is not a figment of commercial japery, if it is not a form of incorporated jackassery, if it actually exists on April 2nd, I‚Äôll eat my hat drink one.
 
The Big Bite Hot Dog Sparkling Water promises to encapsulate the essence of the iconic 7-Eleven hot dog experience, complete with the flavors of ketchup and mustard. This innovative beverage aims to transform the traditional pairing of hot dogs and sodas, allowing consumers to enjoy the essence of their favorite snack in a refreshing bubbly form.

                  <p>I&#x27;ve been eyeballing Cricut machines for a few years now, but it was mostly for stickers for my own use and the cost just couldn&#x27;t be justified.
However, last Sunday I found a faulty Cricut on eBay, put an offer out and it arrived on Wednesday for a total of ¬£35 (including postage).
When plugging the power lead in, the power button briefly shows red and the cutter lights up, but then it all immediately dies. I figured I&#x27;d need to get to the power connect to check the state of the connect and the PCB - perhaps there was a short.
After a lot of screws and jiggling to release plastic covers, I eventually made it to the motherboard, which, on first inspection looked entirely clean.
Looking closer though, the DC barrel connector had a small crack. When I prodded the connector, I could see it was moving, and in fact the positive leg was broken and no longer connected to the motherboard.
My guess is that it was plugged in, someone snagged the power cable but the lead didn&#x27;t remove, instead breaking the DC barrel connector and tearing it out of the motherboard.
Some careful soldering and lot of replacement of screws and I now have a working Cricut. Tidy.</p>

                  <p>I love Australian pro skater Ricky Glaser‚Äôs narration of all the videos he could find of people attempting to jump a famous set of 25 stairs in Lyon. Aaron ‚ÄúJaws‚Äù Homoki (no relation), was the first to do it despite injuring himself on the stairs previously. At 6:15 the scooter carnage starts, ‚ÄúLike is he alive after that?‚Äù We can also appreciate Glaser‚Äôs criticism of the camera work at about 9:50. This is truly a masterpiece.

By the way, you may have heard of Ricky Glaser, as he is the world record holder for most kick flips in a minute, 36, which is just about 3 per second if my math is right.

                  <p>There was a race in Paris where waiters from all the restaurants and cafes and hotels rush through the streets carrying trays with water, croissants, and empty cups of coffee. The race started around 1914, but then it stopped for the last 13 years and now they‚Äôre doing it again because of the Olympics next this year. The runners can switch hands, but they can‚Äôt carry the tray with two hands, and if their glass has less than 10cm of water when they finish, they get 30 seconds added to their finish time. Congratulations to this year‚Äôs winners, Pauline Van Wymeersch and Samy Lamrous. At the end of the race the guy said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre finished!‚Äù And the winners said, ‚ÄúNo, we‚Äôre French.‚Äù

                  <p>Jason‚Äôs only got one rule for guest editors and it‚Äôs, ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre going to post about Utrecht once, you have to post about Utrecht three times,‚Äù which is a bad rule imo and problematic for me because I don‚Äôt know anything about Utrecht except they got bones full of drugs there and a doorbell for fish.
Luckily, I am American and did the American thing of texting the only Dutch person I know when I saw the fish doorbell was opening up for the year, because obviously everyone from the Netherlands will already know about the fish doorbell. He didn‚Äôt know about the fish doorbell, but he did used to be an intern at the Musical Clock Museum in Utrecht, which is a museum focusing on self-playing instruments and musical clocks. The Museum Speelklok appears to contain the second largest such collection in the world behind the Musical Museum in Brentford, which has them beat on self-playing instruments, though it‚Äôs not clear how many musical clocks they‚Äôve got at MM. Regardless, the Utrecht Musical Clock Museum appears delightful and you should visit after visiting the fish doorbell.
Update:
Wintergatan. The marble machine in the video below is exhibited at Museum Speelklok.

(Jason previously wrote about Martin Molin‚Äôs Wintergatan projects in 2020, which were inspired by Martin‚Äôs visit to Museum Speelklok in 2016.)

                  <p>Fish in the Netherlands travel upstream to spawn in the spring, but unfortunately for the fish in Utrecht, the boat lock on the river through the city is closed in the spring. Ecologists put a camera on the bottom of the lock, and viewers around the world can watch a livestream of the camera and, when they see a fish, press a doorbell to open the lock allowing the fish the opportunity to continue swimming upstream to their destiny.
This is a YouTube livestream of the doorbell camera, which is what gets shown to viewers on days like today when more than 900 people are watching the camera, but fear not because they post a weekly highlight reel.

You probably missed the pike and ide, but perch, common roach, and freshwater bream should be swimming by around now.
PS the domain is visdeurbel.nl, which translates into English as Fish Doorbell, and I think Dutch is a very charming language.

                  <p>Researchers from the Freie Universit√§t Berlin working in the Netherlands recently found a little bone container full of drugs in a pile of 86,000 other bones they had found outside a farm in what is now the Dutch city of Utrecht. Initially the researchers missed the find because they weren‚Äôt looking for a first century C.E. bone full of drugs in a bone stack (that‚Äôs a needle in a haystack joke I was afraid you wouldn‚Äôt get, so I‚Äôm just pointing it out, but if you did get it, I‚Äôm sorry for not trusting you as a reader.).
The bone container, discovered when a birch pitch plug was dislodged, was full of black hebane seeds which back in the olden olden olden days was used for ‚Äúrelieving pain and helping with difficult pregnancies. Yet ingesting too much, one Roman author wrote, could lead to ‚Äúalienation of [the] mind or madness‚Äù.‚Äù
Ancient Roman authors were clearly familiar with the plant. Pliny the Elder, Plutarch, and others wrote about black henbane, along with its closely related but less potent relatives, white and yellow henbane. These plants‚Äîin the form of ointments, potions, or burning smoke‚Äîwere prescribed for everything from earaches and toothaches to flatulence and ‚Äúpains of the womb.‚Äù Ancient scholars also warned against taking too much because of the potential for hallucinogenic effects; Pliny counseled physicians to avoid it entirely.

                  <p>Ilia Malinin is 19 and just won the world championship title of international ice skating or something by being an absolute wizard on ice skates. I‚Äôve only been on ice skates 6 or 7 times in my life and I‚Äôm getting better, but I‚Äôm still kinda wobbly, so don‚Äôt take my word for it. Just watch him do all sorts of triple cows lutz axles better than anyone‚Äôs ever done it. My favorite part is when he does the two twisty jumps in a row, which he does at least 3 different times. Imagine being half this good at anything, let alone something as difficult as jumping in circles WITH RAZOR BLADES SCREWED TO YOUR DOC MARTENS.
Malinin landed a quadruple Axel, quad Lutz, quad loop, quad Salchow, another quad Lutz and a quad toe loop, then finished his four-minute skate with a a triple Lutz-triple Axel finale.


I don‚Äôt live too far from Salem, and they still put people on trial for this kind of sorcery there.

                  <p>The Marlins will energize their stadium this year by telling fans to bring their instruments. The notice forbids pots and pans, but doesn‚Äôt say shit about keytars. The team only wants instrument playing during certain moments, to which I say good luck.

                  <p>Imagine you own an ice cream shop and the thermostat on your dipping cabinet, which is the freezer ice cream is dipped (scooped) out of, is set to 4, which is too warm, and you want to make the freezer colder. Are you setting this dial to 3 or to 5 to make the freezer colder? I asked the Gracie‚Äôs followers on Instagram earlier this year and there was lots of discussion. Comment below with your answer unless you already follow Gracie‚Äôs on Instagram, in which case, zip it, buster.

                  <p>A bear enclosure at Woburn Safari Park in Bedfordshire flooded so the zookeepers gave the bears a swan boat to entertain them because as everyone knows, black bears are often mollified by large watercraft shaped like other animals, though you never want to give them a boat shaped like a vole for obvious reasons. The bears are called Harvard, Maple, Colorado, and Aspen, and I might be losing my mind because I stg there are 5 bears in this picture? Deputy Head of Carnivores, Tommy Babbington mused the bears were ‚Äúimmediately intrigued‚Äù by the boat, though admittedly I only quoted him here so I could use the phrase Deputy Head of Carnivores, Tommy Babbington, which is about the most best combination of job title and name I‚Äôve ever heard.
But for real, how many bears do you see?

                  </ul>
                  <p>According to this 2014 article in Slate, roasting vegetables is a cooking technique popularized only in the 80s/90s.
The concept of roasting as a general vegetable technique seems to have originated in a famous Italian restaurant: Johanne Killeen and George Germon‚Äôs Al Forno, which opened in Providence, Rhode Island, in 1980. Forno means oven in Italian, and the critically acclaimed chefs made ample use of that apparatus.


This is a fact, which makes me feel old because I lived through it and makes me feel young because I lived through it. Old because I can remember a time before roasting vegetables was how anyone who is anyone prepared them, and young because what other cooking techniques are we going to invent during my lifetime? It‚Äôs a little like watching cities develop. For example, I used to work down in Fort Point in Boston and there were a ton of parking lots and then the guy who owned the parking lots sold them, bought the Los Angeles Baseball Dodgers and those parking lots have become a huge and glitzy neighborhood (?) with condos and offices and commerce
As another aside, there‚Äôs a 1993 NYT article quoted in the Slate piece and I‚Äôm quoting the first three sentences here for reasons I will expound upon afterward. 
Roasting wafts through the senses. In culinary terms it is freighted with mouthwatering aroma, comforting warmth, a crisping sizzle and anticipated succulence. And lately it is more appreciated than ever.


Anyway, the use of ‚Äúfreighted‚Äù just reminded me of the Emily Dickinson quotation, ‚ÄúThe freight should be proportioned to the groove‚Äù from the poem That Love is all there is. It‚Äôs a delightful poem and you can read it in about 3 seconds and think about it for the rest of your life.

                  <p>I am excited to be back editing Kottke.org this week for the first time in one thousand years, and I am also scared because what if I don‚Äôt remember how to write on the internet? Everything has changed from how it used to be and also has it really? As long as they still make skateboarding videos, we‚Äôll be OK I‚Äôm sure.
As Jason mentioned, I own an ice cream shop called Gracie‚Äôs and an ice cream shop that is also a bar called Earnest Drinks, and you should come to them. A few years ago, I put out a kids‚Äô book called Salty Avocado with Chris, I‚Äôm hoping to put out another kids‚Äô book this year, and like Jason said, I‚Äôm almost done with a novel I hope you get to read sometime. 
This week we‚Äôre gonna have some videos of people doing stuff and also other internet about food and animals, we‚Äôre gonna say mean things about Intuit, we‚Äôre gonna quote Eli Cash, and maybe we‚Äôll do something about ice cream if y‚Äôall want to because it‚Äôs something about which I know a good amount. If you see any typos, no you didn‚Äôt. The last time I edited for a week, there were lots of websites still, and now it feels like there are hardly any, so if you see any good links, please send them over on Blue Sky.

                  <p>Hey, Jason here. I‚Äôm off this week (Mar 25-29) to spend some time with family (and Edith is working on Drawing Media), so my friend and ice cream impresario Aaron Cohen will be taking over the site again (he previously guest edited a couple of times in the ‚Äô10s). He owns and operates Gracie‚Äôs Ice Cream &amp; Earnest Drinks and I hear he‚Äôs working on a novel.
As an ice cream man, Aaron keeps things fun ‚Äî he takes Hard Style photos with patrons (he‚Äôs the one in hat above), makes ice cream tribute flavors for Carly Rae Jepsen (Call Me PB and Carlymel Rae Jepsen), writes a linky newsletter for the shops, and has cool merch.
Welcome back, Aaron!

                  <p>Chappell Roan, a 26-year-old singer-songwriter from Missouri, so I watched her NPR Tiny Desk Concert and loved it. 
(Bizarrely, I first heard of her while chasing down info about Sin√©ad O‚ÄôConnor: I saw mention that there was a Sin√©ad-themed Bratz Doll, but it turned out there was just a rendering of Sin√©ad as a Bratz Doll ‚Äî no actual physical doll ‚Äî as part of their Women‚Äôs History Month programming. Sin√©ad was the second female icon to be Bratz-ified; Chappell Roan was the first.)
In an article from earlier this week, Rolling Stone called Roan ‚Äúthe future of pop.‚Äù Her musicians are fabulous, too.

                  <p>Ghanaian sculptor Paa Joe makes coffins (both human-sized and mini sculptures) modeled after real-life objects that were important to the deceased. He just opened his first NYC solo show at Superhouse; from their description of his work:
Paa Joe is a second-generation fantasy coffin maker, contributing to an artistic tradition of great importance around Ghana‚Äôs capital, Accra. Known as abeduu adeka, or proverb boxes, these end-of-life vessels illustrate Ghanaian beliefs concerning life and death. Since the 1960s, the artist has meticulously carved and painted figurative coffins, representing various living and inanimate objects symbolizing the deceased (an onion for a farmer, an eagle for a community leader, a sardine for a fisherman, etc.).


You read more about Paa Joe‚Äôs work and see more of his pieces at The Guardian:
‚ÄúPeople celebrate death in Ghana. At a funeral, we have a passion for the person leaving us - there are a lot of people, and a lot of noise,‚Äù says Jacob, 28, who has worked with his father for eight years.
Far from seeing their work as morbid, Jacob says the coffins are celebratory and reflect west African attitudes to death. ‚ÄúIt reminds people that life continues after death, that when someone dies they will go on in the afterlife, so it is important that they go in style.‚Äù


And at The Future Perfect, Fad, Hypebeast, and on Instagram. (via @presentandcorrect)

                  <p>Hello! I know I just wrote a blog post about HEAD in git, but I‚Äôve been
thinking more about what the term ‚Äúcurrent branch‚Äù means in git and it‚Äôs a
little weirder than I thought.
four possible definitions for ‚Äúcurrent branch‚Äù
It‚Äôs what‚Äôs in the file .git/HEAD. This is how the git glossary defines it.
It‚Äôs what git status says on the first line
It‚Äôs what you most recently checked out with git checkout or git switch
It‚Äôs what‚Äôs in your shell‚Äôs git prompt. I use fish_git_prompt so that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll be talking about.
I originally thought that these 4 definitions were all more or less the
same, but after chatting with some people on Mastodon, I realized that they‚Äôre
more different from each other than I thought.
So let‚Äôs talk about a few git scenarios and how each of these definitions plays
out i‚Ä¶</p>

                  <p>I really enjoyed this Cup of Jo essay about the pleasure of coming back to childhood hobbies as an adult:
The student in the session before mine is a hedge-fund guy in his 50s, and we giggle at each other in the doorway between our two lessons, as if we‚Äôre seeing through the graying hair and trench coats and wedding rings to greet our promising, 16-year-old selves.


I know I‚Äôve mentioned this here before, but my own life transformed when I got back into what I loved as a kid (drawing!). I picked it up when I stopped drinking, and it‚Äôs since become one of the cornerstones of my day. 
And then on the other end of the spectrum are the hobbies we discover in mid-life, when there‚Äôs less expectation of doing ‚Äúwell‚Äù or of turning anything into a career, and those rule, too. It‚Äôs never too late!

                  <p>the tweet is a photograph of the following letter to the editor of the New York Times Book Review section (not online):
TO THE EDITOR:

Way back in 1997, when Charles Frazier‚Äôs ‚ÄúCold Mountain‚Äù was released, I was given a copy as a present. When I flipped it over, I was struck by a blurb that seemed excessive, bordering on parody. One Rick Bass said of the novel that it ‚Äúis so magnificent ‚Äî in every conceivable aspect, and others perviously unimagined ‚Äî that it has occurred to me that the shadow of this book, and the joy I received in reading it, will fall over every other book I ever read.‚Äù It felt so hyperbolic that it put me off trusting blurbs on dust jackets forever. 
So imagine my surprise when I opened the Feb. 4 By the Book feature to see Rick Bass answer the question ‚ÄúWhat books are on your night stand?‚Äù And he replied, ‚Äú‚ÄòCold Mountain (‚Äòre-re-re-read).‚Äù‚Äù He has restored my faith in the humble, oft-dismissed blurb in one fell swoop. It was that important to him! Lesson learned.

As Ruth put it: ‚ÄúPure and total delight! A perfect letter!‚Äù Here‚Äôs Bass‚Äôs By the Book interview, by the way. I haven‚Äôt read Cold Mountain, but I‚Äôm not sure if this makes me want to or not. I‚Äôd almost rather leave it as this legendary.

                  <p>My teen daughter doesn‚Äôt care for crosswords or the Spelling Bee, but she does try to play Connections every day. We were working on this one together a few days ago and when I suggested SNAIL GALAXY CYCLONE SUNFLOWER as a group, she said ‚ÄúI was thinking spirals but sunflowers are round‚Äù. Which prompted a discussion about the Fibonacci sequence and the golden ratio (which she‚Äôd covered in math class) and a search for videos that explained how the sequence pops up in nature and, specifically, sunflowers.


As beautiful as the sunflower is, isn‚Äôt it even lovelier knowing there is a deep mathematical order to it?


That quote reminds me of Richard Feynman‚Äôs thoughts on the beauty of nature:

                  <p>Pub Choir is an Australia-based organization that gets large crowds singing popular tunes, in three-part harmony no less.
Everybody can sing. Like, not well, but literally. Why should being average at something stop you from doing it!? It hasn‚Äôt yet‚Ä¶ Singing is good for you, it‚Äôs EASY, and Pub Choir is here to show you how.
With a show that is equal parts music, comedy, and beer, Pub Choir is a euphoric sensation that transforms a crowd of tipsy strangers into a legendary choir.
By the end of the show the YOU will be belting out a popular song in three-part harmony.


In the video above, they get a crowd of 1600 people signing Creep by Radiohead. Beautiful.
You can find more of their performances on their YouTube channel, including Tina Turner‚Äôs The Best, Africa by Toto, and Free Fallin‚Äô by Tom Petty.
See also Choir! Choir! Choir! and their performances of Sin√©ad O‚ÄôConnor‚Äôs Nothing Compares 2 U and David Byrne singing David Bowie‚Äôs Heroes. (thx, matthew)

                  <p>A couple of years ago, frustrated by a takeout Italian sandwich with unevenly distributed fillings, I had a wonderful, life-changing idea: chopped sandwiches. It‚Äôs like what you get at those chopped salad places but instead of chopping up all the ingredients and putting them into a bowl, you put them between two slices of bread or in a hoagie roll or whatever. That way, you get all of the elements of the sandwich ‚Äî cheese, tomato, lettuce, dressing/mayo, onion, whatever ‚Äî in every single bite. Yum.
Chopwiches already exist ‚Äî tuna salad, Philly cheesesteaks, chicken salad, egg salad ‚Äî and they‚Äôre amazing because you get all of their deliciousness in every bite. I just wanted to extend that enjoyment to many other types of sandwich: banh mi, BLT, Italian sub, gyro, turkey club, and even the ‚Ä¶</p>

                  <p>This is quite a paragraph from Adam Gopnik‚Äôs New Yorker review (titled The Forgotten History of Hitler‚Äôs Establishment Enablers (subhead: ‚ÄúThe Nazi leader didn‚Äôt seize power; he was given it.‚Äù)) of Timothy Ryback‚Äôs new book, Takeover: Hitler‚Äôs Final Rise to Power:
Ryback details, week by week, day by day, and sometimes hour by hour, how a country with a functional, if flawed, democratic machinery handed absolute power over to someone who could never claim a majority in an actual election and whom the entire conservative political class regarded as a chaotic clown with a violent following. Ryback shows how major players thought they could find some ulterior advantage in managing him. Each was sure that, after the passing of a brief storm cloud, so obviously overloaded that it had to expend itself, they would emerge in possession of power. The corporate bosses thought that, if you looked past the strutting and the performative antisemitism, you had someone who would protect your money. Communist ideologues thought that, if you peered deeply enough into the strutting and the performative antisemitism, you could spy the pattern of a popular revolution. The decent right thought that he was too obviously deranged to remain in power long, and the decent left, tempered by earlier fights against different enemies, thought that, if they forcibly stuck to the rule of law, then the law would somehow by itself entrap a lawless leader. In a now familiar paradox, the rational forces stuck to magical thinking, while the irrational ones were more logical, parsing the brute equations of power. And so the storm never passed. In a way, it still has not.

                  <p>In case anyone saw the news that Lil Nas X ran a half-marathon last weekend and then thought, Hm I wonder if other celebrities have run marathons? (as I did), the answer is: Yes, a lot, and last fall Runners World put together a long list of them, with each of the runners‚Äô times. Shoutout to Bryan Cranston for running a 3:20! üî•
Elsewhere in marathon news, Romper has a good story about a marathoner recovering from a birth injury. (‚ÄúI‚Äôm losing my mind a little bit.‚Äù)

                  <p>This stunning 1.3 gigapixel image of the Vela supernova remnant comes to us courtesy of the Dark Energy Camera at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile. From PetaPixel:
The Vela Supernova remnant, located about 800 light-years away from Earth, is the cosmic corpse of a massive star that exploded 11,000 years ago. It is one of the closest supernova remnants to Earth and the perfect subject for the remarkable Dark Energy Camera.
The supernova is a vast cosmic structure about 100 light-years across. For context, one would have to travel around the Earth 200 million times to have traveled a single light-year.



The full image of the supernova remnant is worth exploring. You can also watch this zoom-in of the image to observe the high level of detail available.

                  <p>You may not have noticed, but weather forecasts ‚Äî temperature, precipitation, hurricane tracks ‚Äî have improved greatly over the past few decades. 

Dr. Hannah Ritchie of Our World in Data explains why.
The first big change is that the data has improved. More extensive and higher-resolution observations can be used as inputs into the weather models. This is because we have more and better satellite data, and because land-based stations are covering many more areas around the globe, and at a higher density. The precision of these instruments has improved, too.
These observations are then fed into numerical prediction models to forecast the weather. That brings us to the next two developments. The computers on which these models are run have gotten much faster. Faster speeds are crucial: the Met Office now chunks the world into grids of smaller and smaller squares. While they once modeled the world in 90-kilometer-wide squares, they are now down to a grid of 1.5-kilometer squares. That means many more calculations need to be run to get this high-resolution map. The methods to turn the observations into model outputs have also improved. We‚Äôve gone from very simple visions of the world to methods that can capture the complexity of these systems in detail.
The final crucial factor is how these forecasts are communicated. Not long ago, you could only get daily updates in the daily newspaper. With the rise of radio and TV, you could get a few notices per day. Now, we can get minute-by-minute updates online or on our smartphones.


If you‚Äôre in the US, you can see how accurate the weather forecast is in your area by using ForecastAdvisor.

Don‚Äôt be the best. Be the only.


In a short clip from a longer interview, Kelly explains what he means by this:
You want to be doing something where it‚Äôs hard to explain to your mother what it is that you do. So it‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúWhat is it? Well, it‚Äôs not quite radio. I don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs like talking.‚Äù And so that‚Äôs where you want to be. You want to be the only. You want to ‚Äî and that‚Äôs a very high bar because it requires a tremendous amount of self-knowledge and awareness to get to that point, to really understand what it is that you do better than anybody else in the world.

                  <p>I thought for sure that I‚Äôd previously written about the secret jelly packet &amp; pickle-based system that chefs at the Waffle House use to ‚Äústore‚Äù all of the orders that come in for food during service, but I can‚Äôt find it in the archive. But no matter ‚Äî the Waffle House training video above runs us through their whole system, including a detailed explanation of their Magic Marker System, which involves zero actual Magic Markers and instead is about arranging condiment packets and other items on plates in a code:
Now let‚Äôs talk about our breakfast sandwiches. Just like omelettes, these sandwiches have the same four positions: ham, sausage, bacon, and plain. To mark a sandwich, place two pickle slices in the appropriate position. Here you can see I put two pickle slices in the number three position, which tells me this is a bacon sandwich. If I add a slice of cheese to the plate, I know this is a bacon cheese sandwich. To make this a bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich, I‚Äôll add this right side up mayo packet to the right side of the plate.
Don‚Äôt let this mayo pack confuse you - as long as you see two pickles on the plate you know this is a sandwich. When marking a sandwich, this mayo packet and pickles means a sandwich with eggs. If a customer wanted the eggs on their sandwich to be scrambled instead of the standard over well egg, I‚Äôd move this mayo pack down to the bottom of the plate to show that the egg is scrambled.


That sounds pretty complicated and they‚Äôve likely faced pressure to change the system over the years, but I bet it works really well in practice and cuts down on errors. I love stuff like this‚Ä¶seeing how different organizations manage their core processes, especially in non-conventional ways. See also Nightclub Hand Signals and The Quarryman‚Äôs Symphony.

                  <p>Several years ago, I heard a performance from the group above while driving. I made a note of their name on my phone ‚Äî Stile Antico ‚Äî and later bought tickets to a concert they were having near where I lived at the time. I invited my boyfriend (also at the time), who made a point of letting me know in not so many words that he wasn‚Äôt into the music and didn‚Äôt really want to go. I think we were also fighting about something else, to be fair. Anyway, we went to the concert. But it didn‚Äôt have the magic that had captivated me on the radio, and I was too aware that my companion wasn‚Äôt enjoying himself, so we left at intermission. The group dropped off my radar until recently, but this performance of music by William Byrd, written more than 400 years ago, just blows me away (full album streaming here). I wish I had stayed for the second half of that show. I should have just been like, ‚ÄúYou go home and let me enjoy my Renaissance music in peace!‚Äù

Trapped in the Iron Age
In 1836, Danish antiquarian and curator Christian J√ºrgensen Thomsen distinguished three prehistorical eras based on the dominant materials used for weapons and cutting implements: the Stone Age, the Bronze Age, and the Iron Age.1 Thomsen‚Äôs classification refers to the past, but according to his criteria, we have never evolved beyond the Iron Age. Even in the 21st century, iron remains the dominant material, not just for weapons and cutting implements but for about every modern technology.
We now use most iron in the form of steel. However, according to Thomsen‚Äôs criteria, we cannot speak of a ‚ÄúSteel Age.‚Äù Firs‚Ä¶</p>

Jason seemed like a good person to start with as we figure out the format, although honestly his actual Media Diet series is more thorough. Look for the next installment in a few weeks!
So, have you seen or read anything good recently?
T-Rex. It‚Äôs not quite IMAX, but it‚Äôs not bad either.

How was it?
And it was definitely a movie that you want to see on the big screen. Like you could feel the bass, and at one particular moment it felt like the whole theater was vibrating.  
I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve read Dune. Have you read it many times?
Dune, ever. 
Really?!
600-page biography of Robert Oppenheimer. And it was good, but I think the movie was better.

                  <p>I have to admit that the illustration style of Daniel Martin Diaz is not completely my cup of tea, but I do like a few of his pieces (like those pictured above). They have an infographic quality that‚Äôs quite compelling ‚Äî and also remind me a bit of Chris Ware, by way of Hilma af Klint and, uh, Edward Gorey maybe?
Anyway, lot of prints of his work are available and you can check out his latest stuff on Instagram.

                  <p>On this day in 1998, 26 freaking years ago, I started writing this blog. I‚Äôve talked at you a lot about the site recently, so I‚Äôll be brief. Last year on this anniversary, I wrote:
My love for the web has ebbed and flowed in the years since, but mainly it‚Äôs persisted ‚Äî so much so that as of today, I‚Äôve been writing kottke.org for 25 years. A little context for just how long that is: kottke.org is older than Google. 25 years is more than half of my life, spanning four decades (the 90s, 00s, 10s, and 20s) and around 40,000 posts ‚Äî almost cartoonishly long for a medium optimized for impermanence.


And still having fun. Perhaps more fun than ever. Thanks to all of you for being a part of it.
P.S. I hope you‚Äôll forgive me taking advantage of any 26-years!-I-love-this-place! feelings you might have today to ask that if you find value in what I do here, I‚Äôd appreciate if you‚Äôd support the site by purchasing a membership. And to everyone who has supported the site over the years, thank you so much!

The basic concept was to encourage post-1960s gender neutrality, saluting values such as individuality, tolerance, and comfort with one‚Äôs identity. A major thematic message is that anyone ‚Äî whether a boy or a girl ‚Äî can achieve anything.


The TV show starred Thomas, Mel Brooks, Harry Belefonte, Dionne Warwick, Carol Channing, Michael Jackson, Dustin Hoffman, and many others. You can watch the whole thing (commercials included) on YouTube:

                  <p>I‚Äôve always been a little fascinated by the list of the largest cities throughout history, so this animated version from Ollie Bye is right up my alley. While watching, it‚Äôs interesting to think about what makes cities grow large at specific times: a mixture of economics, demography, social movements, empire/colonialism, technology, and the like.

                  <p>I love a good movie poster and Dawn Baillie designed one of the best ones ever: the iconic poster for The Silence of the Lambs. Her other work includes posters for Dirty Dancing, Little Miss Sunshine, Zoolander, The Truman Show, and The Royal Tenenbaums. A show of her work opens soon at Poster House in NYC. Some of Baillie‚Äôs original posters are for sale at Posteritati.

                  <p>I recently discovered the ‚Äúpile of fruit‚Äù-themed art of Stephen D‚ÄôOnofrio. I love it! The strawberries are a preliminary sketch, but they‚Äôre what drew me in, and the rest are paintings. He‚Äôs represented by Dallas‚Äôs Galleri Urbane. I also like his ‚Äútrees fitting exactly in the canvas‚Äù paintings.

                  <p>For Ars Technica, science writer Jennifer Ouellette and theoretical physicist Sean Carroll review time travel used in 20 popular movies, ranging from The Terminator to Bill and Ted‚Äôs Excellent Adventure to Interstellar. Each movie is rated on scientific accuracy and how entertaining the use of time travel is. Here‚Äôs part of their review of Superman (1978).
Our standards are admittedly lax when it comes to the physical mechanism by which cinematic heroes journey through time, but ‚Äúflying really fast around the Earth so that it reverses the direction of its rotation and sends it back to a previous moment‚Äù is such thoroughgoing lunacy that one must almost pause in admiration. Then we return to our senses and ask, ‚ÄúWhy does Superman‚Äôs flight have any effect on the rotation of the Earth? And wh‚Ä¶</p>

                  <p>I didn‚Äôt know what to expect from this 1937 video explanation of how wire photos were transmitted to newspapers, but a double stunt sequence featuring an airplane and a death-defying photographer was not anywhere on my bingo card. This starts kinda slow but it picks up once they get into the completely fascinating explanation of how they sent photographs across the country using ordinary telephone lines. The whole setup was portable and they just hacked into a wire on a telephone pole, asked the operator to clear the line, and sent a photo scan via an analog modem. Ingenious!
The Wikipedia page about wire photos is worth a read ‚Äî French designers argued that the technology was responsible for an early form of fast fashion.
After World War II at haute couture shows in Paris, Frederick L. Milton would sketch runway designs and transmit his sketches via B√©linographe to his subscribers, who could then copy Parisian fashions. In 1955, four major French couturiers (Lanvin, Dior, Patou, and Jacques Fath) sued Milton for piracy, and the case went to the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court. Wirephoto enabled a speed of transmission that the French designers argued damaged their businesses.

In it, Merchant argues the Luddites were at their core a labor movement against capitalism and compares them to contemporary movements against big tech and media companies. Merchant writes in the Atlantic:
The first Luddites were artisans and cloth workers in England who, at the onset of the Industrial Revolution, protested the way factory owners used machinery to undercut their status and wages. Contrary to popular belief, they did not dislike technology; most were skilled technicians.
At the time, some entrepreneurs had started to deploy automated machines that unskilled workers ‚Äî many of them children ‚Äî cou‚Ä¶</p>

                  <p>Winter is winding down here in the northern hemisphere (though you wouldn‚Äôt know it from the foot of new snow outside my window), but for practitioners of wild ice skating, spring can bring favorable conditions.
But the problem with Nordic skating or any kind of wild skating ‚Äî which is defined as outdoors and on naturally formed ice, regardless of the style of skate used ‚Äî is finding good ice. Wild-ice seekers extol late fall and sometimes spring for freezing conditions without snowfall, which degrades ice.


Instagram is full of amazing videos of wild skating. When they lower the water level in an icy reservoir, you can even go downhill skating.
Listen to the ice on this one! It reminds me of one of my all-time favorite videos that I‚Äôve posted to the site: The Wonderful Sounds of Skating on Black Ice. (thx, caroline)

                  <p>‚ÄúLike many amateur photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing.‚Äù Well, I can‚Äôt resist the kerfuffle around what‚Äôs going on with Princess Catherine. Yesterday she posted a photo of herself with her family that turned out to have been edited, and today she apologized for ‚Äúany confusion‚Äù it might have caused. (Shared presumably in part to dispel rumors about her health and whereabouts, the photo ‚Äúfans [those rumors] instead,‚Äù per the NY Times.)
Last week, Nieman Lab ran a story on how unusual the Palace‚Äôs response to gossip surrounding the situation has been. And if you really want to get into the weeds, Nieman Lab‚Äôs editor-in-chief Laura Hazard Owen also just linked to a three-minute TikTok video proposing that the original Instagram photo was actually taken last November.

                  <p>Always a good day to highlight the creative work of designer/illustrator Christoph Niemann: a collection of map-based work, including a cheeky metaphorical recipe for an omelet. That intersection isn‚Äôt actually that outlandish: see A Bonkers Highway Interchange and Crazy Whirlpool Traffic Interchange in Dubai.

                  <p>Hello! The other day I ran a Mastodon poll asking people how confident they
were that they understood how HEAD works in Git. The results (out of 1700
votes) were a little surprising to me:
10% ‚Äú100%‚Äù
36% ‚Äúpretty confident‚Äù
39% ‚Äúsomewhat confident?‚Äù
15% ‚Äúliterally no idea‚Äù
I was surprised that people were so unconfident about their understanding ‚Äì
I‚Äôd been thinking of HEAD as a pretty straightforward topic.
Usually when people say that a topic is confusing when I think it‚Äôs not, the
reason is that there‚Äôs actually some hidden complexity that I wasn‚Äôt
considering. And after some follow up conversations, it turned out that HEAD
actually was a bit more complicated than I‚Äôd appreciated!
Here‚Äôs a quick table of contents:

                  <p>If a genie granted me the ability to bring one artist back from the dead to create a portrait of myself or a loved one, without thinking too hard about what it might mean for the artist (‚Äúyou brought me back for what?!‚Äù), I‚Äôd pick John Singer Sargent. I‚Äôm curious about which artists come to mind for others, if anyone wants to chime in. 
Above is ‚ÄúEna and Betty, Daughters of Asher and Mrs Wertheimer,‚Äù from 1901, part of the Wertheimer Portraits. I love their hands in this image.

                  <p>BityBean Baby Carrier. I bought one on a recommendation from parenting writer and economist Emily Oster, and it‚Äôs been one of the best kid purchases I‚Äôve made. I carried my toddler in it every day until I got too pregnant with our second child, but I‚Äôm psyched to bring it back this year. It‚Äôs super minimal and easy to put on, with a weight limit of 40 pounds. There‚Äôs a slight learning curve to put the child in unassisted, but we got pretty good at it after a while. Way more fun than wearing the baby on the front! (And it looks like they also sell it at Walmart.)

‚ÄúFast Car,‚Äù yes, for all eternity, but can we make some room for ‚ÄúBehind the Wall‚Äù? Made a huge impression back then and I‚Äôve still never heard anything else like it. 110 seconds of unaccompanied voice. Spellbinding. 


I hadn‚Äôt heard it in a while and was grateful for the reminder.

This day in history: 2004, 2009, 2014, 2019, 2023 Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Podcasts, events and more. Latest books: You keep readin&#x27; em, I&#x27;ll keep writin&#x27; &#x27;em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I&#x27;ll keep writin&#x27; &#x27;em. Colophon: All the rest. 1900s futurism (permalink) I&#x27;m profoundly skeptical of the idea that the future can be predicted, and doubly skeptical that sf writers are any kind of prophet. The former grotesque fatalism (if the future can be predicted, then what we do doesn&#x27;t matter); the latter is tragicomic hubris.

                  <p>When the Star Wars films aired in Chile, instead of cutting away from the movie for commercial breaks, the TV station ‚Äúseamlessly‚Äù inserted ads for Cerveza Cristal beer. We‚Äôre talking Obi-Wan opening a chest to find a lightsaber for Luke and instead it reveals a ice-chest full of beer. Or the Emperor Force-reaching for a lightsaber and a can of beer flies into his hand. And of course the whole thing has turned into a meme.

The caption of that first photo reads:
Original caption from December 17, 1924: ‚ÄúPicks him up at 25 miles an hour! If the modern auto or truck hits you don‚Äôt worry. Equipped with this device you are simply given a free ride. This man even came from behind another car, was struck but not even scratched. The demonstration was given recently in Washington, D.C.‚Äù


Don‚Äôt worry! A free ride! What an age.

                  <p>Oh no, a dreaded dose of site news ‚Äî but I‚Äôll make this quick. One of the changes I quietly made to the site with the recent redesign is enabling members to set their own price on memberships. It‚Äôs been 7 and a half years since the membership program launched, and I‚Äôve thought about raising prices over the years just to keep pace with inflation, but it never seemed like the right way to go.
So I‚Äôve put that capability in your hands. Now you can voluntarily raise prices if you‚Äôd like ‚Äî here‚Äôs how it works. The price of each membership tier is now a base price that can be added on to (e.g. for the Patron tier, $30 is the minimum but you can increase that to $35 or even $130 if you‚Äôd like). For current members, your chosen new price will go into effect on your next renewal date.
If that‚Äôs something you‚Äôd be interested in doing and are currently a member, you can go to the subscriptions view and click on ‚Äúchange price‚Äù. The whole thing takes about 15 seconds (perhaps a bit longer if you need to log in). For new members, you can simply choose the price you want when you enter your payment information during the signup process.
Ok, that wasn‚Äôt too bad. Now back to our regularly scheduled links from the internet. üíû

                  <p>The other day while chatting on Discord, I paused to pick out an emoji to apply to a friend‚Äôs comment. I wanted to use a heart to show that I liked the comment, but I‚Äôd already used the red heart and wanted to add a little more flair. Usually I just pick a pink one arbitrarily, but in that moment, I was like, WTF do all these little hearts actually mean? Do they have official meanings? Am I using them wrong? 
It‚Äôs a common question, and the answer seems to essentially be: ‚ÄúNo, there are no official meanings,‚Äù although according to Emojipedia the hearts do at least have official names: growing heart, beating heart, and revolving hearts (to choose the three that were least obvious to me). 

The revolving hearts were the most confusing, in my opinion. Why are they revolving? According to The Pioneer Woman, they mean ‚Äúfalling in love, or deep affection.‚Äù That didn‚Äôt seem right, so I asked a few friends. 
‚ÄúSending love?‚Äù my husband said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù 
‚ÄúLove,‚Äù a friend said. ‚ÄúBut specifically between you and the person you‚Äôre sending it to. It‚Äôs like a step up from ‚ù§Ô∏è.‚Äù
Another friend said something similar: ‚ÄúLike ‚ù§Ô∏è,‚Äù she wrote, ‚Äúbut 10% more girlie and romantic.‚Äù
I asked Jason. ‚ÄúI would say there‚Äôs a strong feeling of being intertwined,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúLike, I wouldn‚Äôt send that to a friend. I don‚Äôt think I have ever received that particular emoji from anyone.‚Äù
‚ÄúOk, I‚Äôve never used that particular one,‚Äù another friend echoed, ‚Äúbut I always use the two hearts üíï instead of a red heart, because I think it‚Äôs cuter. I have no idea what üíû means.‚Äù


Emojipedia leaves it open-ended in its üíû emoji-descriptor: ‚ÄúHearts revolving around one or more other hearts.‚Äù (Around even more hearts?) In a 2020 post, Emojipedia also acknowledged that ‚Äúintrinsically each heart has no more coded meaning than what meets the eye.‚Äù

                  <p>I haven‚Äôt watched this yet, but it‚Äôs definitely in my queue: a recording of a livestreamed panel of all the visual effects nominees from this year‚Äôs Oscars, talking about their work on those films. I got this from Todd Vaziri, a visual effects artist at ILM, who says:
If you‚Äôre at all interested in visual effects, you gotta watch this Academy presentation that took place last weekend. It goes in-depth with all five nominees, and shows before/after material that hasn‚Äôt been seen publicly.


The meat of the program begins at around 24 minutes when they start showing visual effects reels from the nominated films (The Creator, Godzilla Minus One, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, Mission: Impossible ‚Äì Dead Reckoning Part One, Napoleon), followed by a discussion with the members of the effects teams.
The Academy has several other nominee programs available on YouTube (including animated feature films &amp; documentary feature films) and more to come in the next few days (including best picture and international feature films). What a trove of material for film lovers.

                  <p>Bill Braun is a ‚Äútrompe l‚Äôoeil painter‚Äù who creates paintings that look like paper craft, complete with visible paper folds, shadows, and even the ‚Äústaples‚Äù holding the ‚Äúpaper‚Äù to the backing. What an incredible illusion. And I always enjoy an artist who is reticent to give an artist statement or explain their work:
I don‚Äôt like to give an artist statement because it undoes the premise of my work, trompe l‚Äôoeil painting. Literally from the French, trompe l‚Äôoeil means ‚Äútrick the eye‚Äù. An artist‚Äôs statement might undo the fundamental aim of convincing the viewer, at least for a moment, that what he sees are actual objects and not a painting. The basic rules of trompe l‚Äôoeil painting are that objects are rendered in real scale, and totally within a shallow painted space. This type of painting has always been a minor branch of realist painting, but with a very long history. The Athenian painters Xeuxis and Parrhasios in 5th century B.C. (as told by Pliny the Elder in his Natural History) and Roman murals of the 2nd century A.D., 16th century Dutch vanitas painting and the 19th century Philadelphia School painters, Harnett, Peto and Haberle, are examples. Today there are still trompe l‚Äôoeil painters around; I am happy to be one of them.

                  <p>Is the universe finite or infinite? If finite, what shape is it and how does that shape influence its overall size and properties? If it‚Äôs infinite, what meaning of ‚Äúexpanding‚Äù can be applied to it? I don‚Äôt know if this video provides any satisfying answers, but even being able to ponder these questions is thrilling.
Infinity gets much weirder though. As you travel with your spaceship in a straight line, you find new galaxies, stars and planets, new wonders, new weird stuff, probably new aliens and new lifeforms stranger than you could ever imagine. But after a long time, you might find the most special thing in the universe: Yourself. An exact copy of you watching this video right now.
How can that be? Well, everything in existence is made of a finite amount of different particles. And a finite number of different particles can only be combined in a finite number of ways. That number may be so large that it feels like infinity to our brains ‚Äî but it is not really. If you have finite options to build things, but infinite space that is full of things in all directions forever, then it makes sense that by pure chance, there will likely be repetition.

                  <p>Adam Yates travelled to Amsterdam to see how the Dutch have transformed the city and made it safer for people to get where they‚Äôre going more quickly. The phrase that grabbed me is:
Pedestrians, cyclists, and vehicles can all coexist without conflict, but only if they‚Äôre all going the same slow speed. This advances the principles of shared streets.


This is related to the Downs-Thomson paradox:
In simple terms, the Downs-Thomson paradox claims that traffic will increase without limit until the option of public transport (or any other form of transport) becomes faster than the equivalent trip by car. It draws the conclusion that people do not care whether they drive, walk, bike, or take the bus to any location ‚Äî they just want to get from A to B in the fastest and most convenient way possible.

                  </ul>
                  <p>Madrid‚Äôs Museo Nacional del Prado recently put on an exhibition called On the Reverse that featured the backs of notable works of art.
This exhibition goes beyond the simple action of turning paintings around. Rather, the Museo del Prado is undertaking a complete reassessment of the backs of works in its collections while also identifying relevant examples in other major museums which reveal how appreciation of works of art is enhanced when we do more than just look at the front. The exhibition addresses issues that have never previously been brought together and in which there is also space for imaginative interpretations: the emergence of the reverse as a pictorial motif in two sub-genres: the self-portrait of the artist behind the canvas and the depiction of the picture back in trompe l‚Äôoeil; the poetic reading of the stretcher as a cross; two-sided paintings; the back as a field for experimentation and subjective expression; aesthetic appreciation of the material nature of the works, and the issue of the viewer seen from behind, which makes us aware of the particular spatial relationships that are generated by human interaction with art.


I once went with an artist friend to an art museum where they hung some of the paintings so you could see both sides of them at once, and she was often more interested in seeing the backs, where you could maybe see who owned the painting previously, etc.
Sadly, the show ended on March 3, but Hyperallergic has a good writeup.

                  <p>Right from the start of her first book, Sense and Sensibility, Austen used an innovative narration technique called free indirect speech:
To understand why Austen‚Äôs narration is so distinct, the method and style of narration in which she wrote must be understood. Austen wrote in a little-known and not-often-used method of third-person narration called free indirect speech. Free Indirect Speech (FIS) is a distinct kind of third-person narration which seamlessly slips in and out of a character‚Äôs consciousness while still being presented by the third-person narrator.


In the video above, Evan Puschak explains, with examples, what free indirect speech is and why it was so revolutionary &amp; influential when wielded by Austen.
Also, I didn‚Äôt know that Twain was such an Austen hater:
She also sparked dislike in such an extreme that Mark Twain once famously wrote that, when reading Pride &amp; Prejudice, he wanted to dig up Austen and beat her with her own shin bone.


Team Austen over here.

The book is due out May 28, but there‚Äôs a (wonderful!) excerpt in the New Yorker, where the whole thing is called ‚Äúwell worth the wait.‚Äù
I‚Äôll probably reread Book One to prepare, in case anyone wants to join me. I loved this book. (I also drew about it in my newsletter once!)

                  <p>Well. Finally. I‚Äôm unbelievably pleased, relieved, and exhausted to launch the long-awaited (by me) redesign of kottke.org today. Let‚Äôs dive right into what has changed and why.

(Justified and) Ancient. The last time I redesigned the site, a guy named Barack Obama was still President. Since then, I‚Äôve launched the membership program, integrated the Quick Links more fully into the mix, (more recently) opened comments for members, and tweaked about a million different things about how the site works and looks.

                  <p>Hey everyone!
This is the list of all the changes we&#x27;ve done to our projects during the month of February.
Summary Of Changes
100r.co, added gimballed stove, open pantry, Little Ninj and LPG fume detection system. Updated galley refit and Western Canada(includes tidal/current resources).
Uxn, with the help of the community, we defined a specification on how labels and sublabels should be nested into each other. Assemblers were updated to reflect that change, including the Uxn REPL.
Left, added accented latin characters support, so you can read and write French and Spanish text files.
Potato, released a final version, added a screensaver(Mastodon).
Hakum, finished Ruler of the Taiga.
News
Late last month we started re-modeling part of our galley, the work is now complete! It&#x27;s subtle, but the splash image for the log now includes the re-design. We will test our new galley when we go out cruising.
Pino will be adventuring a bit more north this summer, we&#x27;re planning to explore the north coast of British Columbia, all the way to Prince Rupert, or possibly Ketchikan(AK), areas with little to no cell coverage. How far we go depends on what we find on the way. If the seas and winds are kind, and if we have time, we might go farther. We spend our days studying charts, gathering supplies, and fixing up the boat to make sure the passage is safe and pleasant. More updates on our plans soon!
Want to see something cool? Xsodect made Tetris(Mastodon) in Orca.
Pino book &amp; movie club
This month we watched The Race to Alaska Movie.

                  <p>For me: a must read.
Reading Moran&#x27;s book I could quickly see that I was the exact target audience for the content: white, cis, straight, leftie male. I try my best to be a feminist but I know that sometimes I end up being an apologist for my own gender.
Moran doesn&#x27;t slam men in her book (as easy as that might be) she instead asks me to celebrate or be proud my masculinism in a way that doesn&#x27;t have to be toxic or have causalities.
Her book has made me question what I consider the ideal values for being a man are. I&#x27;m not sure yet, but I&#x27;d long given up even asking the question.
She also gives some damn good reasoning to help understand the existence of the angry white men, boys that are being, effectively brain washed. It&#x27;s something I don&#x27;t have personal experience of, but having a young son, I&#x27;m even more aware of where he gets his information and inspiration from.
There&#x27;s a lot of really good content in her book, both to spark discussion and reflective thought, but also stories of other men&#x27;s experiences both positive and negative - which has helped me see the similarities in how I conduct myself as a man.
If you&#x27;re anything like me, I highly, highly recommend reading this book.</p>

                  <p>A recently resurfaced 2019 New Yorker story on Linda Ronstadt reminded me of this captivating video from her 1969 appearance on the Johnny Cash Show. Her 1977 version of the song, with Dolly Parton, is also great.

                  <p>Emory Goods is a project run by Erin Emory, a Virginia-based seamstress/artist who, among other things, finds old, damaged, or unfinished quilts and turns them into clothing. As she put it to me in an email (I reached out to make sure I had my facts right), ‚ÄúI like to repurpose cutter quilts, or ones who need a little love, into new, wearable pieces so that we can keep enjoying their beauty, just in a new way!‚Äù  
Emory sells her pieces primarily through Instagram, and although I haven‚Äôt yet tried to buy one, I love knowing they exist. (Emory Goods is also on Facebook, and will be reappearing on Etsy in the next few weeks.)

                  <p>I love playing the NYT crossword, but I only recently discovered Rex Parker Does the NY Times Crossword Puzzle, a blog of daily puzzle reviews, full of spirit and bile. And although like Jason I‚Äôm a little put off by how negative the reviews can be ‚Äî I don‚Äôt want the thing I‚Äôm so proud to have just finished be considered ‚Äútoothless‚Äù or ‚Äúdead in the water‚Äù!! ‚Äî they‚Äôre also funny. So maybe it‚Äôs fine, or actually better. For instance, from his review of Tuesday‚Äôs puzzle: 
The [theme answers] seemed listless (except [REDACTED], which just seemed bizarre), and the overall fill ran weak (and heavily, drearily name-y; more on that below), and then [REDACTED], ugh, I would‚Äôve shut my computer right there if I weren‚Äôt contractually obligated to go on. [‚Ä¶] As for the rest of the puzzle, it was gunked up with names to an unusual, and possibly dangerous degree.


Lol. Meanwhile, there‚Äôs also XWordInfo (NY Times crossword ‚Äúanswers and insights‚Äù ‚Äî useful for puzzle constructors, too), Diary of a Crossword Fiend (‚Äúreviewing the best crosswords in print and on the web‚Äù), and Daily Crossword Links (‚Äúall the day‚Äôs crosswords in one place‚Äù), as well as the NY Times‚Äô own Daily Wordplay Column, an adjoining column riffing on each day‚Äôs puzzle, often with a mini-interview of that day‚Äôs puzzle constructor. (From today‚Äôs constructor: ‚ÄúThis puzzle was partly inspired by my children, who love to put on one red oven mitt and run around the kitchen exclaiming, ‚ÄòLook, I‚Äôm an (18A)!‚Äô‚Äù) The comments section here is also a goldmine for community-minded puzzlers.  What else is out there?
But really the main thing to do after finishing the puzzle is to open the Spelling Bee back up‚Ä¶ Am I right???

                  <p>It‚Äôs Thursday Afternoons With Edith again! I‚Äôll probably stop saying that after today. Here‚Äôs another installment of comics from my journal, from back around Thanksgiving. Jury is still out on whether this is a winning Kottke.org feature, but in the meantime I do enjoy sharing them.

                  <p>When I linked to a recent NY Times article about rewilding golf courses, I pulled out this startling fact: ‚ÄúThe United States has more golf courses than McDonald‚Äôs locations.‚Äù Nathan Yau of FlowingData found that that is indeed true but wondered where all of the golf courses were actually located. (A: typically not in cities where the McDonald‚Äôs are concentrated).

This makes more sense now. You can have a golf course in an area where there aren‚Äôt that many people, because people will travel to play golf. Few people are going to travel specifically for McDonald‚Äôs.
If we compare the two, you see the McDonald‚Äôs city concentrations, and golf fills the in-between spaces.

                  <p>I offer a single bit of advice to friends and family when they become new parents: When you start to think that you‚Äôve got everything figured out, everything will change. Just as you start to get the hang of feedings, diapers, and regular naps, it‚Äôs time for solid food, potty training, and overnight sleeping. When you figure those out, it‚Äôs time for preschool and rare naps. The cycle goes on and on.
The same applies for those of us working in design and development these days. Having worked on the web for almost three decades at this point, I‚Äôve seen the regular wax and wane of ideas, techniques, and technologies. Each time that we as developers and designers get into a regular rhythm, some new idea or technology comes along to shake things up and remake our world.

                  <p>Cutting to the chase: text editors *and* tabs vs. spaces!  Ooooh!


I&#x27;ve had this thing called &quot;e&quot; for a while now.  It&#x27;s a stupid little 
script which serves to do a couple of things.  It starts my 
editor
with a given file, and it kicks it with the right arguments to make it 
disable line wrapping and to make the [TAB] key actually put in two 
spaces.


So, my dumb script would use &quot;-w -E -T 2&quot; most of the time, except when it 
was running on a Makefile, at which point it would skip those args.  
Simple enough, right?


pico is back?  Yes indeed, on Macs, as of 12.3, pico is in fact back.  To 
make sure I wasn&#x27;t imagining things, I tracked down a machine that hadn&#x27;t 
been upgraded yet and checked there.  Sure enough, it was in fact nano and 
not pico.


macOS 12.3 has nano as a symlink... pointing to pico!


At some point, I switched from literal tab characters in my source code to 
blobs of spaces, probably due to using that style at work and not hating 
it.  So, somewhere along the line I actually started depending on nano 
behavior without realizing it.


As for the lack of a feature in pico itself, it&#x27;s kind of strange, really.  
If you go digging into the source, they have this random.c with a function 
called tab which claims to &quot;simulate tab stop&quot; using spaces.  That said, I 
can&#x27;t find any place where it would be called with the magic values which 
would make it behave that way.


It wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if this switch is just more of Apple removing 
GPLed things from their OS - pico seems to use the Apache license.  They 
dumped bash for zsh (MIT license) at some point (Big Sur, I think), and 
now this?  Okay then.</p>

                  <p>Here&#x27;s a very old and stupid trick you could do with some filesystems in 
some situations back in the day... and might still be able to do in a 
few places today.


The problem is that while version X might eventually have an exploit, 
it&#x27;ll get removed and it&#x27;ll be replaced by version Y without that
particular hole.  By the time you get your hands on a tool to break into 
X, it&#x27;ll be gone.


What you&#x27;d do is create a hard link pointing at the file you wanted to 
preserve, storing it in a spot which was writable by your account.  
Then, say, /usr/bin/sudo (because that never has security 
issues...) gets replaced at some point with a new file and you get to 
keep the old version.  When you get the tool to pop it, off you go!


Of course, these days, it&#x27;s not quite so easy on the more modern systems 
you find.  Debian 11 here won&#x27;t let me do it - it&#x27;s EPERM city.  Rocky 8 
(so CentOS 8 and RHEL 8 too) also won&#x27;t do it.  They both have some gunk
in /usr/lib/sysctl.d to lock this down.  But, my old Slackware 14.2 
install of my workstation let me do it the last time I tried about 
a year ago.  How about that, huh?  I bet it&#x27;d still work if I dug out 
the old drives and booted them up.


Incidentally, this is the magic sauce: /proc/sys/fs/protected_hardlinks
Read the man page for proc(5) to learn more about it.

here it is,
the thread I read a long time ago.  It&#x27;s interesting to note that as far 
as I can tell, nothing actually changed upstream.  This left paranoid 
admins like me with no option but to use the (most excellent) Openwall 
patches to lock down this kind of stuff.  I used that on my machines at 
work which had non-staff users... just in case.


This whole situation is scary.

                  <p>Back in January, you might have seen my
post
about a very large BBS which seemed to solve for the problem of &quot;how do 
we host a bunch of users&quot; by having one physical box per user.  It might 
have been one physical box per *two* users, maybe, but it&#x27;s hard to say.


Now, keep in mind digital cameras weren&#x27;t easy to come by, so I have 
very few actual pictures.  I&#x27;ll have to do a lot of explaining to make 
up for the lack of detail and alternate angles.  Clearly, I had no 
notion of ever using these pictures to tell stories 25+ years later.


Some friends at a local company had some bandwidth to spare (a T1 to 
Alternet somewhere, as I recall), so they parked a Zoom modem on one of 
their boxes and plugged it into a phone line.  We got an identical model 
to avoid cross-brand issues (Zoom m‚Ä¶</p>

                  <p>One of the fun things I used to do at a prior job was to dig through the 
raw data points which were collected from the *many* servers we had.  I 
could just pick an interesting-sounding metric and then would just ask 
the system to show me the top 10 or bottom 10 out of a population of 
thousands or more.


To get my feet wet with the whole &quot;investigations&quot; thing that we&#x27;d do, I 
started looking into this one day and chose one of the many temp sensors 
which were being logged by the servers.  I forget exactly which one it 
was, for there were many.  The CPUs logged it, the chassis logged it, 
the power supply logged it, and so on.  There were so many choices.


I went looking for a reason.  What could possibly explain this?  First 
off, it didn&#x27;t line up with any obvious pattern in the host names.  The 
hosts were named for whichever team owned them, followed by a sequence 
number that was bumped any time a new one was provisioned.  There was no 
signal to be found in that.


There was more, though.  You could also see a &quot;rack position&quot; in this 
data, and now it started getting interesting.  It seems that all of the 
really hot machines had a rack position of something low, like 04 or 05, 
and never anything higher than that.  In fact, when looking at a whole 
rack, it was always the lowest number of all of the positions that were 
being used.  Now this was worth chasing!


It&#x27;s good that I asked, since they told me something surprising: 
position 04 or 05 or whatever was the *bottom* of the rack.  Yes, 
somehow, the lowest machine in the rack was the hottest!  They found 
this interesting, too, and wound up digging into it.  Given that I was 
far away in a distant office, this was the best way for us to proceed.


The problem was that the bottommost server would have nothing below it 
but just open space until it got to the floor.  That space would not 
move air efficiently, and it obviously mattered.


This rolled out and my hot spots disappeared.  Fantastic!</p>

wish I didn&#x27;t have to write about.

wrote
about seeing a maintenance truck rolling down the Caltrain line in 
Mountain View.  It had a special attachment to let it stay on the rails.  
At no point did the arms come down for the crossing.  It managed to 
approach, then the people inside looked around and went through, and the 
arms never budged.  There were no flashing lights or bells.




caught fire.  A bunch of people were hurt.  More were shaken 
up.


I&#x27;m assuming their construction trucks don&#x27;t trigger the &quot;short the 
rails together to signal various things&quot; logic, either.  This would 
mean that crossing arms stay up... and I have to assume it also means 
the signals along the way stay green instead of going red.

We will presumably hear more about whatever the signals said, and 
whether the train went past a red signal or not.  I just have a bad 
feeling that they saw a green and kept on going.</p>

                  <p>Here&#x27;s a little bit of Silicon Valley local flavor for a change.  We 
have this freeway that runs from San Jose to San Francisco called US 
101, or around here, just &quot;101&quot;.  (Southern California has it too, but 
they call it &quot;the&quot; 101.  That&#x27;s how we detect invaders.)  Anyway, this 
thing is usually eight or more lanes up and down the peninsula, and it&#x27;s 
had a &quot;diamond&quot; or car pool lane on the #1 (innermost/&quot;fast&quot;) lane for 
many years.  You had to have a certain number of people in the car (or 
some other conditions met) during certain hours (AM and PM rush, 
weekdays), or you&#x27;d be in for a hefty ticket.


How does the system know what to charge you?  Well, you either have an 
old-style toll transponder that always bills you as a solo driver, or 
you have a new-style transponder with a 1/2/3+ switch that tells the 
road how to handle you.


Think about what this does to enforcement.  Now, instead of just &quot;is 
there a vehicle in the lane&quot;, &quot;is it the right time during a weekday&quot;, 
and &quot;how many people are in the car&quot;, now it&#x27;s also a matter of &quot;do they 
have their transponder set properly&quot;.

to poll it from time to time.  Actually doing that poll like a good 
netizen (remember that concept?) takes a little attention to detail.


Given the reality of the situation, does it make sense to poll every 10 
seconds?  Probably not, right?  Someone set up something like that and 
left it running for a couple of months until I finally noticed it and 
dealt with it myself.


Given this, you can keep track of the &quot;Last-Modified&quot; header when you 
get a copy of the feed.  Then, you can turn around and use that same 
value in an &quot;If-Modified-Since&quot; header the next time you come to look 
for an update.  If nothing&#x27;s changed, the web server will notice it&#x27;s 
the same as what it already has, and it&#x27;ll send you a HTTP 304 co‚Ä¶</p>

                  <p>Here&#x27;s a concept: &quot;ssh to prod and edit directly on the machine&quot; is 
generally bad news.


I should point out that I didn&#x27;t know this person and had no idea how 
they would respond to such feedback - it might have been fine!  They 
might be a well-adjusted person who can take a request like that and not 
turn it around into a full-on nuclear attack.  But, I didn&#x27;t know either 
way.


At some point, I actually had a meeting with this developer for some 
other reason, and what happened was kind of amazing.  First thing, he 
brought it up and asked me about it.  I said something like, &quot;well, I 
didn&#x27;t want to get into it, but since you asked&quot;, and proceeded into 
something along the lines of &quot;obviously it would be best if you didn&#x27;t 
do that - sshing in and twiddling Python files on the actual production 
AWS instance of the service&quot;.


&quot;But... I suspect you are doing it for some reason?&quot;


My response was... I hope... reasonable: &quot;So as much as I would love to 
say &#x27;don&#x27;t do that!!!&#x27;, I&#x27;m not going to stand in the way of you 
literally doing your job.  So please proceed with care, and keep an eye 
open for some day when (first dumb thing) and (second dumb thing) aren&#x27;t 
problems any more and you need not do this any more.&quot;


It was either &quot;edit in prod&quot; or endure DAY LONG development cycles: make 
a change, wait 24 hours, come back tomorrow, and try it again.  That&#x27;s 
how broken it was.


The best part about this was that we had a totally reasonable 
conversation about it.  It&#x27;s the kind of thing which had become a rare 
commodity in those days at that place.


Would I expect someone else to go to that level of insanity every single 
time they just want to get their job done?  Absolutely not.

Editing files in prod to develop them?  That&#x27;s bad news.  Deliberately 
rigging tunnels to spoof a connection from prod?  That&#x27;s also bad news.  
Having to do them to get your job done?  You might be in the bad place.</p>

                  <p>Quite a while back, I wrote a post that basically went like this: if 
someone has a problem with someone else or something that person is 
doing, they&#x27;re going to find a way to get to &quot;no&quot;.  They will find some 
reason, some excuse, or some problem with it.  They&#x27;ll bring up a point 
and you&#x27;ll show that this is not in fact a thing.  They will then pivot 
again and again.


But, as I said, that was back then, and this time I&#x27;m talking about 
something else: when it happens in person with a coworker.  I had an 
experience like this a few years back, and figured I&#x27;d share how it goes 
for the sake of others who might not have encountered it yet, or who 
have and thought they were alone in this.

                  <p>This is a short one since it&#x27;s somewhere between a random bit of 
&quot;grab some popcorn&quot; amusement and a &quot;huh, that might be a problem some 
day&quot;.  In short, it looks like every Raspberry Pi filesystem installed 
from any given release image probably ends up with the same
UUID.


For instance, if you downloaded the &quot;lite&quot; version of Raspbian between 
roughly November 8th and January 28th, you probably got a file called 
2021-10-30-raspios-bullseye-armhf-lite.zip.  Inside, there&#x27;s an image, 
and the idea is that you dump that straight to your SD card, cram it in 
the Pi, and off you go.  The second partition on that image is an ext4 
filesystem which was created on some build machine somewhere.  The UUID 
on it never gets &quot;evolved&quot; to something else after the install.


You can see it inside the image itself here:


Or, if you actually installed a few of these things like I did over the 
past couple of months, you can just &#x27;tune2fs -l /dev/mmcblk0p2&#x27; and see 
the same value in there.


Don&#x27;t end up with a pile of SD cards on your desk and think &quot;I know, 
I&#x27;ll use the filesystem UUIDs to track which one goes where&quot;, in other 
words.


If it&#x27;s not breaking anything for you, it&#x27;s probably best to just let it 
be.  Untangling a boot mess on these weird little boxes is anything but 
fun.

Note: if you&#x27;re actually on a recent Raspberry Pi, odds are good that 
your /etc/fstab will be using *partition* UUIDs (PARTUUID&#x3D;...) and not 
those of the filesystem.  If in doubt, use blkid to see what&#x27;s what.</p>

                  <p>There are some interesting implications to the way that you have to 
handle references to other bits of code when you write a C++ header 
file.  There are things you can do which turn out to be suboptimal, and 
until or unless you work someplace with a coding style document or get 
some mentor who&#x27;s already been there, you&#x27;re likely to make some
mistakes.


Anyway, a common way to do this is to set up the outer class such that 
it has a pointer to the inner one.  You *could* have it just own it 
directly, but then that introduces problems.

  Bar bar_;



Of course, bar.h probably has its own dependencies which get #included, 
and so now you end up with this evil web of slow compiles.  It sucks.

                  <p>Yesterday, I
put forth
a bunch of API possibilities for the problem of needing to return a 
value but also indicating the lack of a value and being able to comment 
on why.  In it, the notion of a &quot;wrapper&quot; around a string was presented, 
such that it might look like &quot;Result&quot;, and those brackets 
started looking like a pain.  There was also the possibility of having 
something like &quot;ResultString&quot;, but didn&#x27;t that open the door to having a 
bunch of code duplication?


After this had existed for a while, the general happy feeling of having 
this stuff in place became infectious.  I wanted it to cover other 
things with it, too.  I wanted it to handle something a bit more 
complicated than a mere string, and so decided to try my hand at the

                  <p>If you agree with the notion that you need to be able to tell the 
difference between the absence of a value and a value itself, then this 
has some impacts on the code you write.  If you want to keep &#x27;em 
separated (so they can come out and play), then it gets you looking at 
your API designs in certain ways.


Imagine we&#x27;re talking about a helper function that is intended to be run 
inside a program that&#x27;s handling the access to a web page.  It&#x27;s 
probably a CGI program, but it could also be buried inside some much 
bigger thing, too.  This is all about C++ styles, but you can probably 
see slices of other languages in here, too.

https://lwn.net/Articles/883547/):


If you do privileged execution of specific operations via IPC you get 
the guarantee that whatever is done, is done from a well-defined, 
pristine execution environment, without leaking context implicitly. The 
IPC message is the *full* vulnerable surface, and that&#x27;s as minimal as 
it can get. And that&#x27;s great.




Oh wow, thank you for mentioning that, unnamed reader!  I definitely 
read that post on LWN at some point in the past couple of days when the 
pkexec thing started going around.  It must have really worked its way 
into my head, and then eventually stirred up the memory of everything 
getting &quot;nicely infected&quot; at $OLD_JOB.

                  <p>I once worked at a place that had an interesting little problem stemming 
from the way they managed machines and some of the fun side-effects 
processes can have on each other.  This is back in the pre-systemd days 
of running services, such that things tended to be started or restarted 
by someone or something that itself ran as root.  That is, if you 
started something, it might inherit one or more things from your 
environment.  Likewise, if you ran something with an unusual 
environment, it might bestow those &quot;gifts&quot; onto anything it happened to 
touch.


After locking themselves out of machines too many times, people 
generally learned that after you mess with a glibc upgrade, you restart 
the sshd listener on port 22.  Of course, they also had to learn to not 
whack EVERY sshd at the‚Ä¶</p>

                  <p>Nearly 30 years ago, I was given this picture.  I wanted to present it 
in a post all by itself to give it a chance to &quot;sink in&quot; before I went 
and used it in an analogy.  First, I&#x27;ll just show the image and explain 
what you&#x27;re looking at here.




I do remember the description from the back: this is a picture of *part 
of* something that was called the Software Creations BBS.  It was a 
multi-line bulletin board system where you could dial up and send 
messages to people, upload and download files, and (presumably) play 
online games (&quot;doors&quot;) and anything else they cared to offer.

64 machines in a little space.  I have to assume 
they are at least 
286s (ATs, more or 
less), but it&#x27;s impossible to tell from just this picture.  They could 
have been 386s or even 486s by that point, but ‚Ä¶</p>

                  <p>Okay, so yesterday I 
posted
a picture of an old multi-line bulletin board system which had 
apparently taken over an entire bedroom with dozens of computers.  I 
mentioned that I intended to come back to the topic to throw in my own 
two cents, and so here we go.


Or, were you someone who found it horrific and wished there was a 
simpler way?  Did you wonder if it would be possible to pack all of that 
into one or maybe two boxes, instead?  Did you want a way to negate all 
of that complexity while still providing the same level of service?


Now, things are different.  I look at that and just sigh at the lost 
opportunities.  The actual amount of work being done on behalf of any of 
the users who are connected is tiny.  If we ignore the fact that the 
actual BBS software and related acc‚Ä¶</p>
