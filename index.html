                  <p>Catia Lattouf and an assistant run a medical clinic and rehab center for hummingbirds in her Mexico City apartment.
With dozens of the tiny birds buzzing overhead, along walls and the window of her bedroom, Lattouf explained that she began caring for them a year after surviving colon cancer in 2011. It started with one hummingbird that had an eye injured by another bird.
A veterinarian friend encouraged her to try to help it. She named it Gucci after the brand of the glasses case she kept it in. The bird became her inseparable companion, perching on her computer screen while she worked.
&quot;It wrote me a new life,&quot; she said of the nine months the bird lived with her.


I&#x27;m not entirely sure I&#x27;d like 60 hummingbirds constantly flitting around my house, but I&#x27;m not entirely sure I wouldn&#x27;t like that either.

                  <p>I think this might be my favorite Every Frame a Painting yet: Taylor Ramos and Tony Zhou explore how a film editor does what she does. Or as Zhou puts it, &quot;how does an editor think and feel?&quot; The point about emotions taking time is especially interesting, as is the accompanying comparison between similar scenes from The Empire Strikes Back and Ant Man.
Emotions take time. When we watch people onscreen, we feel a connection to them. And that&#x27;s because we have time to watch their faces before they speak and time to watch them afterwards. Editors have to decide, &quot;how much time do I give this emotion?&quot;

                  <p>Madeline Miller (Circe, Song of Achilles) got sick in February 2020 with what turned out to be Covid, which then turned into Long Covid. It has profoundly affected her life (gift link).
I reached out to doctors. One told me I was &quot;deconditioned&quot; and needed to exercise more. But my usual jog left me doubled over, and when I tried to lift weights, I ended up in the ER with chest pains and tachycardia. My tests were normal, which alarmed me further. How could they be normal? Every morning, I woke breathless, leaden, utterly depleted.
Worst of all, I couldn&#x27;t concentrate enough to compose sentences. Writing had been my haven since I was 6. Now, it was my family&#x27;s livelihood. I kept looking through my pre-covid novel drafts, desperately trying to prod my sticky, limp brain forward. But I was to…</p>

                  <p>A short TED-Ed video on the flow state of creativity and how you might enter it more easily.
Flow is more than just concentrating or paying attention; it&#x27;s a unique mental state of effortless engagement. And those who more frequently experience flow report higher levels of positive emotions, creativity, and feelings of accomplishment. But what exactly is flow? And how can we find it in our daily lives? Explore steps you can take to increase your chances of finding flow.


While I am not feeling particularly in the groove today, over the past several weeks I&#x27;ve been in the flow state a lot, working on a couple of projects for the site. It&#x27;s been a long time since I&#x27;ve had that feeling for more than a couple of hours every few months and booooooy does it feel good. There is almost nothing that fills me with as much joy as the &quot;effortless engagement&quot; of being in the flow state. I&#x27;m very glad it&#x27;s back in my life — I&#x27;d been afraid it was gone forever. (via open culture)

                  <p>Oh wow, I love these spaceship paintings from Karla Knight. They&#x27;re from a series called 33 Spaceships for Another Planet but she&#x27;s been doing these diagrammatic/picographic paintings and drawings for some time now. It&#x27;s fun to back through Knight&#x27;s older work and see how her ancient yet futuristic style evolved. Here&#x27;s my best stab at a succinct description of her aesthetic: imagine Hilma af Klint as the production designer for Wes Anderson&#x27;s Stargate.

                  <p>This short, relaxing, mesmerizing video of an Martian impact crater called Aram Chaos was taken by the HiRISE camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The images were run through an enhanced color red-green-blue filter, which tends to highlight the structure and geology rather than the true color. For example, the blue in the video often represents basalt, an igneous rock of volcanic origin.

The AIGA&#x27;s annual roundup of the best designed books and covers is usually aces and the results of the 2022 competition (announced at the beginning of July 2023) is no exception. Here are a few I picked out that I didn&#x27;t feature in The Best Book Covers of 2022 back in December.




Uh, I guess I&#x27;m really into orange today? Anyway, these covers are from:
Butts: A Backstory by Heather Radke.
Sound Within Sound: Radical Composers of the Twentieth Century by Kate Molleson.
Sabit Fikir by Paul Valéry.
No hay nadie en casa by Isabel Díaz Alanís.

                  <p>Sometimes I talk to friends who need to use the command line, but are
intimidated by it. I never really feel like I have good advice (I’ve been using
the command line for too long), and so I asked some people on Mastodon:
if you just stopped being scared of the command line in the last year or
three — what helped you?
(no need to reply if you don’t remember, or if you’ve been using the command
line comfortably for 15 years — this question isn’t for you :) )
This list is still a bit shorter than I would like, but I’m posting it in the
hopes that I can collect some more answers. There obviously isn’t one single
thing that works for everyone – different people take different paths.
I think there are two parts to getting comfortable: motivation and resources. I’ll

                  <p>Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&amp;M, says that the most likely way people will be impacted by the climate crisis won&#x27;t be with some big disaster but with a bunch of small changes that add up to something unmanageable.
Let me give you an example of a tiny impact that I just heard about. My wife told me about a new group of members at her gym: active 70-ish-year-olds who used to go on walks around their neighborhood. Due to the unbearable heat in Texas, though, they joined a gym and now walk indoors on treadmills. This story embodies several aspects of climate impacts that everyone should understand.
First, this is an example of non-linear climate impacts. Although temperatures have been rising gradually over the last century, it was only recently that they crossed a critical th…</p>

                  <p>David Zipper, who researches and writes about mobility and transportation, recently did a big thread on Mastodon (and Bluesky) about car bloat: the way in which cars and trucks have gotten much bigger and heavier in the US over the past few decades and how it&#x27;s bad for society. The whole thread is worth a read...here are a couple of Zipper&#x27;s points:
Tall vehicles have bigger blind spots and are more likely to strike a person&#x27;s torso or head. Heavier vehicles exert more force crashing into a person, bicycle, or smaller car. They also have longer braking distances.



Heavier cars exert more pressure on tires, eroding them faster. Tire particles are absorbed into water, where they damage ecosystems. They also float through the air, harming human health when ingested.


For further reading, Zipper links to a number of pieces he&#x27;s written in recent months: The Blatant Greenwashing of SUVs, EVs Are Sending Toxic Tire Particles Into the Water, Soil, and Air, Carry That Weight, and The Car Safety Feature That Kills the Other Guy. Zipper&#x27;s solution to these problems is government action: for example, taxing vehicles by weight, testing vehicles for pedestrian and cyclist safety, or requiring drivers have commercial driver&#x27;s licenses for larger vehicles.

                  <p>Scrabble is one of those games where pro/expert gameplay differs so much from amateur/novice gameplay that it might as well be a totally different game. In this entertaining recap of the finals of the 2023 Scrabble World Championships, former US champ Will Anderson explains how finalists David Eldar and Harshan Lamabadusuriya think and strategize throughout the best-of-seven series.
Gameplay aside, the thing that stood out for me is how many of the words played I&#x27;d just never heard of before. Like, at least 60% of them. Like I said, it&#x27;s just a completely different game at the expert level, with a shit-ton of memorization required. I don&#x27;t play Scrabble for this reason — because if you don&#x27;t have a bunch of two-letter words and Q,Z, &amp; X words memorized and you&#x27;re playing against someone who does, it&#x27;s not fun. But it is fun to see two heavyweights of the game go at it on equal terms. (via peterme)

                  <p>Someone recently asked me – “how do you deal with writing in public? People on
the internet are such assholes!”
I’ve often heard the advice “don’t read the comments”, but actually I’ve
learned a huge amount from reading internet comments on my posts from strangers
over the years, even if sometimes people are jerks. So I want to explain some
tactics I use to try to make the comments on my posts more informative and
useful to me, and to try to minimize the number of annoying comments I get.
talk about facts
On here I mostly talk about facts – either facts about computers, or stories
about my experiences using computers.
For example this post about tcpdump contains some basic facts about how to use tcpdump,
as well as an example of how I’ve used it in the past.
Talking about facts means I get…</p>

                  <p>Now with added ChatGPT
I’m writing this post sleepless and with a headache, which I find is the best way to write posts, because it removes all the verbal guardrails, so, be forewarned.
Back in 2016, a year before recorded history, I stole a simple idea: What if I wrote a bot to reply to spammers, pretending to be interested in their wares, and wasting their time?
After some creating this, it turned out that it was possible, and Spamnesty was born.
Spamnesty was cleverly disguised as a company, Mnesty, LLC, Asia’s premier maritime logistics company, strategically located in the land-locked Mongolia.
Of course, this didn’t tip spammers off that the whole thing was fake, because why would they even care to look at the site?
This resulted in untold amounts of entertainment, whiling the small hours of the morning away, reading about the likes of the hapless Abdullah Ishaq, whose attempt of selling LedTrading.com to my bot did not</p>

                  <p>It is astounding to me the number of YouTube channels that I have never heard of with subscriber bases larger than that of many countries. (This goes double and triple for Instagram and TikTok.) Alan Becker has over 23 million subscribers and makes videos pitting animated characters against various other entities. His latest video is Animation vs. Math and it is super nerdy and engaging. You might have to be a bit of a math nerd to enjoy this fully, but even if you only get the gist of what&#x27;s going on (like I did for at least half of the video), it&#x27;s still pretty entertaining. You can check the comments for an explanation of the math or this illustrated explainer.

                  <p>Today I was thinking about – what happens when you run a simple “Hello World”
Python program on Linux, like this one?
print(&quot;hello world&quot;)

Here’s what it looks like at the command line:
$ python3 hello.py
hello world

But behind the scenes, there’s a lot more going on. I’ll
describe some of what happens, and (much much more importantly!) explain some tools you can use to
see what’s going on behind the scenes yourself. We’ll use readelf, strace,
ldd, debugfs, /proc, ltrace, dd, and stat. I won’t talk about the Python-specific parts at all – just what happens when you run any dynamically linked executable.
Here’s a table of contents:
parse “python3 hello.py”

                  <p>In a June piece for The Guardian and the video above from just a few days ago, Robert Reich outlines five crises — including wokeness, the trans panic, and critical race theory — that Republicans have manufactured in order to deflect from their true agenda. 
Virginia governor Glenn Youngkin&#x27;s &quot;day one&quot; executive order banned the teaching of critical race theory. DeSantis and Greg Abbott, the Texas governor, have also banned it from schools.
Here again, though, there&#x27;s no evidence of a public threat. CRT simply teaches America&#x27;s history of racism, which students need to understand to be informed citizens.
Banning it is a scare tactic to appeal to a largely white, culturally conservative voter base.


However, I would argue that Reich needed to go a bit further. While the crises are inventions, their consequences go beyond mere distraction and into the territory of active harm, particularly of queer and trans people, Black people, and people of color. That&#x27;s why I modified the title from his original.

Google is the shining example here: having made one good product (search), they then fielded an essentially unbroken string of in-house flops, but it didn&#x27;t matter, …</p>

                  <p>In the 1994 Caribbean Cup qualifying group stage match between Barbados and Grenada, the 90 minutes of normal time ended with an intentional own goal by Barbados and then with Grenada trying to score either a goal or an own goal and Barbados defending both nets. Say what?! How did this happen?
Well, it was the confluence of a few things:
The match would go into overtime in case of a tie.
The &quot;golden goal&quot; rule was in effect for overtime...the first goal wins and the match is immediately over. Oh, and the goal is worth 2 goals, not just one.



To qualify for the next round, Barbados not only needed to win the match, they needed to win it by two goals...a one-goal difference would not be enough.

I found out about the match by reading this SBNation article but Wikipedia does a better job in…</p>

                  <p>From Adam Kovacs&#x27; YouTube channel Adam Something comes this brisk 10-minute video essay on why European malls are doing better than their American progenitors. I thought his third point, about poor urban planning, was particularly interesting: malls tend to fail in America because they are not integrated into the fabric of towns and cities (because very little is integrated into the fabric of cities and towns in many places these days).
Malls, hell, all commerce has to be an organic part of towns and cities. People should be able to get to them by means other than a car, and conveniently. Such integrated commercial spaces are far more resilient. If your commercial spaces aren&#x27;t resilient — if you just plop a big box outside the town — don&#x27;t be surprised when it goes bust in a few years. And then it&#x27;s bulldozed for the next thing to be put up for it to go bust the same way and then get bulldozed and then the next thing and the next and the next so on and so forth.

                  <p>As you may know, this summer I am leading the design of the inaugural State of HTML survey.
Naturally, I am also exploring ways to improve both survey UX, as well as all questions.
Shaine Madala, a data scientist working on the survey design team proposed using numerical inputs instead of brackets for the income question.
While I was initially against it,
I decided to explore this a bit further, which changed my opinion.
There are actually four demographics questions in State of X surveys where the answer is essentially a number, yet we ask respondents to select a bracket:
age, years of experience, company size, and income.
The arguments for brackets are:
They are more privacy preserving for sensitive questions (e.g. people may feel more comfortable sharing an income bracket than their act…</p>

                  <p>The music for Sinéad O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s 1990 smash hit Nothing Compares 2 U is already pretty stripped down to emphasize the vocals, but in this video, the vocals are almost fully isolated so you can really hear the clarity and emotion in that wonderful voice of hers.
The song was apparently recorded in one take:
&quot;I actually think the intensity of Sinéad&#x27;s performance came from the breakup of her latest relationship,&quot; opines Chris Birkett, who co-produced and engineered the track as well as the accompanying, Grammy Award-winning album, I Do Not Want What I Haven&#x27;t Got, which topped the Billboard 200 for six weeks and sold seven million copies worldwide. &quot;She had been dating her manager, Fachtna O&#x27;Ceallaigh, who&#x27;s a really good guy and had been instrumental in getting her deal with Ensign Records. However, their relationship had gone pear-shaped and they were in the process of breaking up when we recorded &#x27;Nothing Compares 2 U&#x27;, so that&#x27;s probably why she did such a good vocal. She came into the studio, did it in one take, double-tracked it straight away and it was perfect because she was totally into the song. It mirrored her situation.&quot;

You can also find it on Soundcloud and Bandcamp. I ran across it when Radiohead shared a snippet of it on TikTok.
FWIW, Dwells seems to be the same DJ Dwells that won the NYC regional of the prestigious DMC DJ competition when he was just 13 years old. (via @jessicabrillhart)

The Trump team used lies about the election to justify organizing fraudulent slates of electors in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.

                  <p>Cruise ships are a relatively new human invention that look quite different from other ships. Oh, and they are absolutely massive. How did they get that way?
The predecessor of today&#x27;s cruise ships was the ocean liner: big, beautiful ships that sailed across the Atlantic. But ocean liners had a totally different purpose from cruise ships: They were for transportation. Everything about them was designed to facilitate an ocean voyage from one continent to another.
But air travel changed that. Planes eliminated the main reason to take a ship somewhere, and ocean liner business plummeted. So the industry pivoted and began selling a ship as the destination itself. The cruise ship was born. But the ocean liners, built for a voyage, weren&#x27;t ideal for the purposes of a cruise, and over the next few decades, the cruise ship began its evolution. And it has culminated in the behemoths we see today.


Cruise ships always make me think of David Foster Wallace&#x27;s classic piece, Shipping Out (which you might know as A Supposedly Fun Thing I&#x27;ll Never Do Again).

                  <p>[Note: If you&#x27;re reading/watching this, I assume you&#x27;ve watched season two or don&#x27;t care about spoilers; they abound.] The Bear is an intense show about a group of intense people doing an intense job. It can be tough to watch sometimes because people often communicate by screaming and yelling at each other. As Evan Puschak observes in this perceptive video essay, the second season delves into where some of those behaviors came from (surprise: childhood trauma) and offers a counterbalancing force: tenderness, listening, and paying attention.

                  <p>I have said previously that &quot;even on my busiest day, I will drop everything to watch a video of pencils being made&quot;. Still true! This video from Process X of a Tokyo pencil factory really hits the spot. My favorite part of watching pencils get made is always the sharpening of the finished pencils by belt sander.

                  <p>I&#x27;ve gotta say that I was a little skeptical when Phil Edwards started out this video saying that he wasn&#x27;t going to talk about Pac-Man&#x27;s gameplay as a vital component of why it was such a huge success when in came out in 1980. He allows that, of course, the gameplay was very compelling but other factors truly pushed the game beyond the competition and into its own category, including the decline of pinball (profit per square foot), its family friendliness, and some legal &amp; financial maneuverings.
Oh, and here&#x27;s the playable keychain-sized Pac-Man that you can see in the video. Didn&#x27;t even know that was a thing!

                  <p>Mastodon is easy and fun except when it isn&#x27;t. Erin Kissane asked folks why they had disengaged from Mastodon; they described reasons like a hostile response from regulars, poor discoverability, and too serious/boring.
A bleak account of a Greyhound bus ride across the US. &quot;Gone are the small, clean, cheap motels in the centre of cities, gone are public spaces where anyone can find a water fountain, a bathroom, a place to nurse a cheap cup of coffee and human company.&quot;
I think about Little Bobby Tables once a week, minimum.
Rules for design in the real world: &quot;If it looks neat, people will want to take a photo with it. If it looks comfortable, people will want to sit on it. If it looks fun, people will play around on it.&quot;

                  <p>The roots of hip-hop and rap are various and stretch back in time to the antebellum South and from there to Africa. But by some accounts, a song called Noah by gospel group The Jubalaires was the first instance of recorded music that sounded like rap. Listen for yourself...the relevant bit is right around the 35-second mark:

I&#x27;m not a music historian by any stretch, but that sounds 30 years ahead of its time. There are several bad remixes of Noah on YouTube...this one is maybe the best at pairing their singing with a rap beat.

                  <p>Designed by Olson Kundig Architects, the Maxon House features a studio that&#x27;s attached to the main house but can be rolled away on railroad tracks to be closer to the trees. From Dezeen:
The two-storey structure was based on the design of the &quot;traditional caboose&quot;. A workspace sits on the first level while the second, accessible via a steel ladder, serves as a cupola for taking in views and functions as a &quot;calmer zone for creative exploration and restoration&quot;.
The control panel that operates the rails was taken from a Burlington Northern locomotive, while the door colour and the wood used were directly informed by colours and materials commonly found on American trains.
The railroad ties for the track were repurposed from the Great Northern Railroad line, though the studio noted the steel tracks &quot;are a much larger gauge than is typically used&quot;.


There&#x27;s even a Wes Anderson connection (because of course there is):
Inspired by Wes Anderson&#x27;s love of trains in cinema, Maxon Railway takes some visual cues in the form of on-board artifacts and props from The Darjeeling Limited.


You can read lots more about the house and the railway, including more than you&#x27;d probably want to know about the history of rail travel and commerce in the Pacific Northwest.

                  <p>In 2006, photographer Mark Preuschl recreated Georges Seurat&#x27;s famous impressionist painting A Sunday on La Grande Jatte in Beloit, WI with a group of volunteers. Here&#x27;s the original for reference:

From My Modern Met:
In conceiving this tableau vivant, the organizers wanted to keep things modern. Thus, all participants are wearing contemporary clothes with umbrellas substituted in for the 19th-century parasols. Though the team was organized, they weren&#x27;t quite prepared for what mother nature threw their way the day of the shoot. Preuschl recalls winds of 20 to 25 mph coming off the river, as well as clouds that didn&#x27;t allow for the shadows they were so desperately looking for. Luckily, there was a window of about 25 minutes when the sun came out and cast those shadows.


He really couldn&#x27;t have scouted that location any better...it matches the original pretty well. Who knew you could find Belle Époque Paris in southern Wisconsin?

                  <p>Rebecca Solnit, writing for The Guardian on the climate crisis:
Many things that were once true — that we didn&#x27;t have adequate solutions, that the general public wasn&#x27;t aware or engaged — no longer are. Outdated information is misinformation, and the climate situation has changed a lot in recent years. The physical condition of the planet — as this summer&#x27;s unprecedented extreme heat and flooding and Canada&#x27;s and Greece&#x27;s colossal fires demonstrate — has continued to get worse; the solutions have continued to get better; the public is far more engaged; the climate movement has grown, though of course it needs to grow far more; and there have been some significant victories as well as the incremental change of a shifting energy landscape.


I don&#x27;t think of myself as a climate doomer, but I certainly feel less hopeful about the situation than Solnit does. She asserts that the main obstacles to meaningful action on the climate crisis in the West are politics and capitalism, which is supposed to make readers feel hopeful. But that&#x27;s the part that often fills me with despair. The unpopular extremist party that controls more than half of the political apparatus in the country with the biggest responsibility to fix the planet is not only not interested in doing so, they are actively working against it. And they&#x27;ve built up such a wall against public accountability that I don&#x27;t know if protest (which they will make illegal if they can) or even voting (which they&#x27;ve fought to make more difficult) are meaningful levers with which to try and change the situation.
Ok, maybe I am a climate doomer. But this piece by Solnit is good medicine for folks in despair about the climate. And I&#x27;m putting Not Too Late: Changing the Climate Story from Despair to Possibility (edited by Solnit and climate activist Thelma Young Lutunatabua) on my reading list as well.

                  <p>This is pretty cool: in collaboration with the British Museum, a team led by woodblock printmaker David Bull (who I first wrote about back in 20051) is carving woodblocks and creating prints from a series of previously unpublished drawings by legendary Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai.
The Museum has in their possession a group of drawings by Hokusai that were apparently intended for use in the production of a series of books. For reasons unknown to us now that project was cancelled, but the drawings survived, and we have selected 12 of them for a new subscription series.
For more details of the collection of images, please refer to this page of the British Museum website. But here, we can simply note that the drawings fall into a number of categories, and our set will reflect that diversity. Hokusai&#x27;s series was intended to take his readers through aspects of Japanese historical culture, and we will meet Buddhist deities, warriors from ancient China, and historical landscapes, along with more prosaic scenes of the natural world.


The print shown above was the first one to be sent out in January. But look at this original drawing from the collection:

Wow. That is shockingly modern — like a 60s superhero comic or a still from 60s anime. I hope they reprint this one!
Here&#x27;s a video from the British Museum of Bull talking about the project:

If you make woodblock prints for a living, you know the name Hokusai, and if you&#x27;re a woodblock carver and you hear about original drawings from Hokusai that have never been carved into prints you would most likely do a little happy dance.


(via open culture)

Hooo boy, there are parts of that post that did not age well. Bull, however, is still doing his thing.↩

                  <p>In 1910, a group of inexperienced climbers claimed to have summited Denali, the highest peak in what is now the United States. Their story was greeted with skepticism.
So when I found out that the first people to reach the highest point in North America (Denali, the mountain formerly known as McKinley) were just a bunch of Average Joes with no climbing experience who went up on a bet, I was flabbergasted. How had I never heard this story? The more I looked into it, the more fantastic the story became. When these guys descended from the mountain, nobody believed they really even made it. And they wouldn&#x27;t be the first people to fraudulently claim to have reached the top, with no evidence to offer that they succeeded. This story has all the makings of a blockbuster action comedy. It&#x27;s almost unbelievable.


But later evidence suggests that they just might have made it to the top.

                  <p>I write a lot about technologies that I found hard to learn about. A
while back my friend Sumana asked me an interesting question – why are these
things so hard to learn about? Why do they seem so mysterious?
For example, take DNS. We’ve been using DNS since the 80s (for more than 35 years!). It’s
used in every website on the internet. And it’s pretty stable – in a lot of
ways, it works the exact same way it did 30 years ago.
But it took me YEARS to figure out how to confidently debug DNS issues, and
I’ve seen a lot of other programmers struggle with debugging DNS problems as
well. So what’s going on?
Here are a couple of thoughts about why learning to troubleshoot DNS problems
is hard.
(I’m not going to explain DNS very much in this post, see Implement DNS in a Weekend or my DNS blog post…</p>

                  <p>In 1842, a French artist and scholar named Joseph-Philibert Girault de Prangey set out on a tour of the eastern Mediterranean to document sights and architecture via the brand new medium of photography. He started off in what is now Italy and continued on to Greece, Egypt, Turkey, Syria, and the Levant (which includes modern-day Lebanon, Israel, and Palestine). The daguerreotypes he took are the oldest surviving photos of those locations (aside from Italy). It&#x27;s incredible to time travel back 180 years to see what these places looked like. (via aeon)

                  <p>Vox talked to four television writers about how streaming and prestige TV have changed the financial picture for writers over the past 15 years, contributing to the writers strike that&#x27;s been going on since early May.
Companies like Netflix, Hulu, Apple TV+, and more have given consumers an unprecedented array of films and TV shows and opened the door to new voices that don&#x27;t have to adhere to mainstream network formats. On the other hand, streaming has also changed how television gets produced, the role writers play, and how they get paid. We interviewed four television writers and showrunners about how streaming has changed how they work, how their incomes have taken a hit, and why it has become harder than ever to build a career.

                  <p>You have likely participated in several Devographics surveys before,
such as State of CSS, or State of JS.
These surveys have become the primary source of unbiased data for the practices of front-end developers today
(there is also the Web Almanac research, but because this studies what is actually used on the web, it takes a lot longer for changes in developer practices to propagate).
You may remember that last summer, Google sponsored me to be Survey Design Lead for State of CSS 2022.
It went really well: we got 60% higher response rate than the year before, which gave browsers a lot of actionable data to prioritize their work.
The feedback from these surveys is a prime input into the Interop project,

                  <p>I just really love the hell out of these iterative Lego build videos from Brick Experiment Channel and Brick Technology. In this one, a car is repeatedly modified to roll perfectly on an increasingly inclined treadmill. I started watching and in 10 seconds I was 100% invested.
They&#x27;re not even really about Lego...that&#x27;s just the playful hook to get you through the door. They&#x27;re really about science and engineering — trial and error, repeated failure, iteration, small gains, switching tactics when confronted with dead ends, how innovation can result in significant advantages. Of course, none of this is unique to engineering; these are all factors in any creative endeavor — painting, sports, photography, writing, programming. But the real magic here is seeing it all happen in just a few minutes.

                  <p>Traditionally, the subjects depicted in Western art were either religious or rich — wealthy patrons paid for paintings of themselves or of their religions. As Evan Puschak explains in this brief video essay, that began to change in the 16th century as revolution, reformation, and the development of a merchant class shifted who was worthy of depiction and who could pay.

                  <p>Stephanie Shih is a Brooklyn-based ceramic artist who makes painted sculptures of ordinary objects like food, shoes, hats, and signs. A recent exhibition focused on the overlap of immigrant communities of Asians and Jews on NYC&#x27;s Lower East Side and Chinatown.
A few yards from where the Bernstein-on-Essex sign hangs is a long table that displays Shih&#x27;s sculpted takes on other iconic food and drink, like a bilingual bottle of Soy Vay Veri Veri Teriyaki, roast pork on garlic bread, Golden Plum Chinkiang Vinegar, and a can of Dr. Brown&#x27;s Cel-Ray Soda.
&quot;A lot of my solo shows are about this idea of authenticity,&quot; says Shih, who has been working in ceramic full-time since 2015. &quot;There are no cultures that are untouched by other cultures. These are two communities that grew up alongside each other. It was not always friendly, but simply from proximity and the fact that they were the two largest non-Christian immigrant groups, they had commonalities.&quot; For example, she says, the tradition of Jews eating Chinese food on Christmas began right near Harkawik, on the Lower East Side.

                  <p>When you apply power with higher-than-normal voltage to electric kids toys, they tend to move faster. When you apply 30V instead of the usual 2.5V or 5V, they move really fast:

This reminds me of when I was in grade school. Does anyone remember Stompers? They were battery-operated cars and trucks that were bigger than HotWheels and, while not remote-controlled, were able to move around under their own power. But they weren&#x27;t that speedy...maybe they could do 1-2 mph.
Anyway, some kid at school figured out that you could remove the AA battery, connect wires to the battery terminals, and then connect those wires to as many C- and D-cell batteries as you could gang together in a series. So instead of the usual 1.5V, you could pump 4.5V, 6V, 7.5V, or even 9V into those tiny cars. And boy, did they go. We could barely keep up as we raced them against each other down the halls, running behind them holding our battery packs. But the thrills were short-lived — I think the school banned them and all that current burned the tiny Stomper motors out after awhile. Fun while it lasted though! (via waxy)

                  <p>For the past 13 years, former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich has taught a class called Wealth &amp; Poverty at UC Berkeley. He retired from teaching this year and has uploaded his lectures from the course to YouTube. 
Welcome to my final UC Berkeley course on Wealth and Poverty. Drawing on my 40+ years in politics, including my time as secretary of labor, I offer a deeper look at why inequalities of income and wealth have widened significantly since the late 1970s in the United States, and why this poses dangerous risks to our society.
This course also offers insights into the political and public-policy debates that have arisen in light of this inequality, as well as possible means of reversing it.


Here&#x27;s the first lecture, What&#x27;s Happened to Income &amp; Wealth:

Reich has also published an abbreviated syllabus for each of the classes; links can be found in his course introduction (here&#x27;s class #1).

                  <p>In our community, it&#x27;s so common for developer projects to be open-source. I&#x27;m breaking with this trend for my blog, but I have good reasons! In this article, I&#x27;ll share my reasoning, as well as a workaround in case you _really_ want to see the source. If you&#x27;re considering whether a project should be open-source or not, I hope you&#x27;ll find it valuable.</p>

Say what?! Comet 12P/Pons-Brooks will be visible during the 2024 total solar eclipse. Double feature!
Every Christopher Nolan movie, ranked by the AV Club. Oppenheimer is a surprise #1. My #1 would be Dunkirk or maybe Inception. But I&#x27;ve always preferred The Dark Knight Rises to The Dark Knight so grain of salt and all that.

                  <p>To help celebrate 50 years of hip-hop, Cypress Hill visited NPR&#x27;s studios to perform a Tiny Desk Concert.
While the term &quot;pioneer&quot; is used loosely in pop culture today, few terms describe Cypress Hill&#x27;s impact over the past three decades more adequately. They are the first Latino hip-hop group to achieve platinum and multi-platinum status. B Real, Sen and producer DJ Muggs crafted a sound in the &#x27;90s that stretched beyond regional boundaries. It was dark, psychedelic and at times directly addressed mental health before the topic was commonplace. Many dismissed the group as &quot;stoner rappers,&quot; yet the members were fervent advocates for the legalization of weed long before it came to fruition.


Really enjoyed this one...I&#x27;m not a particular fan of Cypress Hill but after this, maybe I am?

I saw Oppenheimer last night (great!) and the first thing I did when I got home was to order the book on which it&#x27;s based, the Pulitzer-winning American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer.

                  <p>It&#x27;s always fun to see what the former President is planning on reading over the summer. Here&#x27;s his full list:
Poverty, by America by Matthew Desmond.
Small Mercies by Dennis Lehane.
King: A Life by Jonathan Eig.
Hello Beautiful by Ann Napolitano.
All the Sinners Bleed by S.A. Cosby.
Birnam Wood by Eleanor Catton.
What Napoleon Could Not Do by DK Nnuro.
The Wager by David Grann.
Blue Hour by Tiffany Clarke Harrison.


I&#x27;ve read The Wager (so good!) and have been wanting to dig into Matthew Desmond&#x27;s book but most of the rest of these are new to me.
Right now, I&#x27;m reading Hugh Howey&#x27;s Wool (after inhaling the first season of Silo) and American Prometheus (after seeing Oppenheimer last night) — I&#x27;m sensing a pattern here...

                  <p>WordPress has been with me since my very first post in 2009.
There is a lot to love about it: It’s open source, it has a thriving ecosystem, a beautiful default theme, and a revolutionary block editor that makes my inner UX geek giddy.
Plus, WP made building a website and publishing content accessible to everyone.
No wonder it’s the most popular CMS in the world, by a huge margin.
However, for me, the bad had started to outweigh the good:
Things I could do in minutes in a static site, in WP required finding a plugin or tweaking PHP code.
It was slow and bloated.
Getting a draft out of it and into another medium was a pain.
Despite having never been hacked, I was terrified about it, given all the horror stories.
I was periodically getting “Error establishing a database connection” errors, w…</p>

                  <p>Long-time readers will recall that I used to link to Flash games pretty regularly. They were typically easy to play and hard to put down — I collected them under the addictive Flash games tag. The collective time and energy spent by kottke.org readers playing these games over the years is, well, I don&#x27;t even want to take a guess. So, it is with regret for the rest of your workday that I pass along this site that contains playable versions of tens of thousands of Flash games, including many of the ones I&#x27;ve collected. Here are several that you might remember:
Cyclomaniacs
Fantastic Contraption 2



Hedgehog Launch



Desktop Tower Defense



Solipskier



Gimme Friction Baby



BridgeCraft



Idleplex



Axon



Wonderputt



Love



Alphabet Shoot



Bubble Tanks Tower Defense



Perfect Balance



Don&#x27;t Shoot the Puppy

Good luck with all that...I only escaped after an hour of poking around. 😬 (via waxy)

                  <p>François Vautier installed an ant colony in his scanner and scanned it each week for five years. This is the resulting time lapse video.
Five years ago, I installed an ant colony inside my old scanner that allowed me to scan in high definition this ever evolving microcosm (animal, vegetable and mineral). The resulting clip is a close-up examination of how these tiny beings live in this unique ant farm. I observed how decay and corrosion slowly but surely invaded the internal organs of the scanner. Nature gradually takes hold of this completely synthetic environment.

                  <p>54 years ago today, on July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong &amp; Buzz Aldrin landed on the Moon and went for a little walk. For the 15th year in a row, you can watch the original CBS News coverage of Walter Cronkite reporting on the Moon landing and the first Moon walk on a small B&amp;W television, synced to the present-day time. Just open this page in your browser today, July 20th, and the coverage will start playing at the proper time. Here&#x27;s the schedule (all times EDT):
4:10:30 pm: Moon landing broadcast starts
4:20:15 pm - 10:51:26 pm: Break in coverage
10:51:27 pm: Moon walk broadcast starts
Set an alarm on your phone or calendar! Also, this works best on an actual computer but I think it functions ok on phones and tablets if necessary.
Back in 2018, I wrote a bit about what to look out for when you&#x27;re watching the landing:
The radio voices you hear are mostly Mission Control in Houston (specifically Apollo astronaut Charlie Duke, who acted as the spacecraft communicator for this mission) and Buzz Aldrin, whose job during the landing was to keep an eye on the LM&#x27;s altitude and speed — you can hear him calling it out, &quot;3 1/2 down, 220 feet, 13 forward.&quot; Armstrong doesn&#x27;t say a whole lot...he&#x27;s busy flying and furiously searching for a suitable landing site. But it&#x27;s Armstrong that says after they land, &quot;Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.&quot;. Note the change in call sign from &quot;Eagle&quot; to &quot;Tranquility Base&quot;. :)
Two things to listen for on the broadcast: the 1201/1202 program alarms I mentioned above and two quick callouts by Charlie Duke about the remaining fuel towards the end: &quot;60 seconds&quot; and &quot;30 seconds&quot;. Armstrong is taking all this information in through his earpiece — the 1202s, the altitude and speed from Aldrin, and the remaining fuel — and using it to figure out where to land.

                  <p>After my post about Soap Bubble Worlds yesterday, several people sent me this video of the rainbow colors that can be seen on the surface of and in the steam above a swirling cup of hot water. I was expecting a straight-forward visual display accompanied by some relaxing music (and that version does exist) but it also includes a fascinating explanation of where all these colors and swirls come from.
Scientific investigations into beautiful phenomena always makes me think of physicist Richard Feynman&#x27;s thoughts on beauty:
I have a friend who is an artist, and has sometimes taken a view which I don&#x27;t agree with very well. He&#x27;ll hold up a flower and say &quot;Look how beautiful it is&quot; and I&#x27;ll agree. And he says, &quot;you see, as an artist I can see how beautiful this is, but you as a scientist take this all apart and it becomes a dull thing.&quot; And I think that he&#x27;s kind of nutty.
First of all, the beauty that he sees is available to other people, and to me too, I believe - although I may not be quite as refined aesthetically as he is, but I can appreciate the beauty of a flower. At the same time, I see much more about the flower than he sees. I could imagine the cells in there, the complicated actions, which also have a beauty. I mean, it&#x27;s not just beauty at this dimension of one centimeter, there&#x27;s also beauty at smaller dimensions. The inner structure, also the processes, the fact that the colors and the flower are evolved in order to attract insects to pollinate it is interesting. It means that insects can see the color.
It adds a question: Is this aesthetic sense also exist in the lower forms that... why is it aesthetic... all kinds of interesting questions which the science, knowledge, only adds to the excitement, and mystery, and the awe of a flower. It only adds. I don&#x27;t understand how it subtracts.


(thx, everyone)

                  <p>This is the third spinoff post in the migration saga of this blog from WordPress to 11ty.
Migrating was a good opportunity to rethink the information architecture of my site,
especially around categorization.
Categories vs Tags
Just like most WP users, I was using both categories and tags, simply because they came for free.
However the difference between them was a bit fuzzy, as evidenced by how inconsistently they are used, both here and around the Web.
I was mainly using Categories for the type of article (Articles, Rants, Releases, Tips, Tutorials, News, Thoughts),
however there were also categories that were more like content tags (e.g. CSS WG, Original, Speaking, Benchmarks).
This was easily solved by moving the latter to actual tags.
However, tags are no panacea, there are several is…</p>

                  <p>This is a second spinoff post in the migration saga of this blog from WordPress to 11ty.
On good URLs
It was important to me to have good, RESTful, usable, hackable URLs.
While a lot of that is easy and comes for free, following this principle with Eleventy proved quite hard:
URLs that are “hackable” to allow users to move to higher levels of the information architecture by hacking off the end of the URL
What does this mean in practice?
It means it’s not enough if tags/foo/ shows all posts tagged “foo”, tags/ should also show all tags.
Similarly, it’s not enough if /blog/2023/04/private-fields-considered-harmful/ links to the corresponding blog post,
but also:
/blog/2023/04/ should show all posts from April 2023
/blog/2023/ should show all posts from 2023
/blog/ should show all posts

                  <p>When you think of directors that have influenced Wes Anderson, you typically think of Truffaut, Godard, Scorcese, and Ashby. But as you&#x27;ll see in this video of Anderson pulling out some recommended films from this Paris video store, his taste in movies is broad. There&#x27;s Drunken Angel (Kurosawa), A Streetcar Named Desire (Kazan), Vagabond (Varda), Birth (Glazer), Bridge of Spies (Spielberg), and Witness (Weir).
Of Spielberg, Anderson says:
If you make movies, if you direct movies, this is somebody who can help you. You looked at his movies for solutions. He usually found a way to do it right. He&#x27;s one of my favorites.

                  <p>This, from XKCD, hits my science and design interests right in the sweet spot.
If you covered the surface of the Atlantic Ocean with twelve-point printed text, with the lines wrapping at the coasts, the expansion of the ocean basin due to tectonics would increase your word count by about 100 words per second.


This reminds me of Ben Terrett&#x27;s calculation of how many helveticas from here to the Moon and my subsequent calculations about the point size of the Earth and the Moon (50.2 billion and 13.7 billion, respectively).

                  <p>Following on from my hard and easy way of getting timezone from an IP address, having the timezone (as text) is one thing, now finding the actual offset is entirely a different problem.

TL:DR; jump to the spoiler if you can&#x27;t be bothered to read/listen to me ramble!
The problem isn&#x27;t timezones, it&#x27;s day light saving
It&#x27;s all very well knowing what timezone a particularly location is sitting on. We can show the user the UTC time, but when it doesn&#x27;t match the wall clock because they&#x27;re currently observing DST, then it&#x27;s just…weird.
So now we need to know if the location is observing DST, or not. Or if perhaps they never observe DST (like Hawaii).
The long hard way
There is the IANA timezone dataset which has custom data structures that describe the location and how time is observed in that…</p>

                  <p>So I recently ported my 14 year old blog from WordPress to Eleventy.
I had been using Disqus for comments for years, so I didn’t want to lose them, even if I ended up using a different solution for the future (or no comments at all).
Looking around for an existing solution did not yield many results.
There’s Zach’s eleventy-import-disqus but it’s aimed at importing Disqus comments as static copies,
but I wanted to have the option to continue using Disqus.
Looking at the WP generated HTML source, I noticed that Disqus was using the WP post id (a number that is not displayed in the UI) to link its threads to the posts.
However, the importer I used did not preserve the post ids as metadata (filed issue #95).
What to do?
Getting the WP post id
My first thought was to add the post id to each po…</p>

                  <p>Still one of my favorite internet things: The case of the 500-mile email.
I was working in a job running the campus email system some years ago when I got a call from the chairman of the statistics department.
&quot;We&#x27;re having a problem sending email out of the department.&quot;
&quot;What&#x27;s the problem?&quot; I asked.
&quot;We can&#x27;t send mail more than 500 miles,&quot; the chairman explained.
I choked on my latte.  &quot;Come again?&quot;
&quot;We can&#x27;t send mail farther than 500 miles from here,&quot; he repeated.  &quot;A little bit more, actually.  Call it 520 miles.  But no farther.&quot;
&quot;Um... Email really doesn&#x27;t work that way, generally,&quot; I said, trying to keep panic out of my voice.  One doesn&#x27;t display panic when speaking to a department chairman, even of a relatively impoverished department like statistics.  &quot;What makes you think you can&#x27;t send mail more than 500 miles?&quot;
&quot;It&#x27;s not what I *think*,&quot; the chairman replied testily.  &quot;You see, when we first noticed this happening, a few days ago—&quot;
&quot;You waited a few DAYS?&quot; I interrupted, a tremor tinging my voice.  &quot;And you couldn&#x27;t send email this whole time?&quot;
&quot;We could send email.  Just not more than—&quot;
&quot;—500 miles, yes,&quot; I finished for him, &quot;I got that.  But why didn&#x27;t you call earlier?&quot;
&quot;Well, we hadn&#x27;t collected enough data to be sure of what was going on until just now.&quot;  Right.  This is the chairman of *statistics*. &quot;Anyway, I asked one of the geostatisticians to look into it—&quot;
&quot;Geostatisticians...&quot;
&quot;—yes, and she&#x27;s produced a map showing the radius within which we can send email to be slightly more than 500 miles.  There are a number of destinations within that radius that we can&#x27;t reach, either, or reach sporadically, but we can never email farther than this radius.&quot;

	
Here&#x27;s a FAQ that addresses some of the questions the more technically inclined among you may have about this story.

                  <p>This is a supercut of the final moments of the Titanic as represented in various films and TV shows, from 1912&#x27;s La Hantise to a 2012 British TV series written by Downton Abbey&#x27;s Julian Fellowes. It also doubles as a demonstration of the increasing capabilities and aspirations of filmmakers and their special effects teams throughout the years, although in terms of budget and effort, James Cameron&#x27;s effort in 1997 marks the high point.

What a resource!

                  <p>Greta Gerwig takes us on a whirlwind tour through 33 films that influenced the Barbie movie, visually, thematically, and in terms of plot/content. The influences include The Wizard of Oz, Rear Window, Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure, Singin&#x27; in the Rain, The Godfather, Oklahoma!, 2001, and Saturday Night Fever.
Then, Saturday Night Fever, I always had a sense of wanting this to be a movie with an amazing soundtrack. Saturday Night Fever obviously has this incredible soundtrack by the Bee Gees. There&#x27;s a documentary about the Bee Gees, and I&#x27;d seen it and was so touched by the Bee Gees, and I thought Barbie seemed so disco to me in her heart, because Barbie&#x27;s sort of — and I will say this as a lover of Barbie and disco — a little bit dorky in the best way. Saturday Night Fever was a movie that was driven by music, but not a musical. I guess we&#x27;re half of a musical.

                  <p>Jia Tolentino writing for the New Yorker on What to Do with Climate Emotions:
Climate anxiety differs from many forms of anxiety a person might discuss in therapy — anxiety about crowds, or public speaking, or insufficiently washing one&#x27;s hands — because the goal is not to resolve the intrusive feeling and put it away. &quot;It&#x27;s not a keep-calm-and-carry-on approach,&quot; Davenport told me. When it comes to climate change, the brain&#x27;s desire to resolve anxiety and distress often leads either to denial or fatalism: some people convince themselves that climate change is not a big deal, or that someone else will take care of it; others conclude that all is lost and there&#x27;s nothing to be done. Davenport pushes her clients to aim for a middle ground of sustainable distress. We must, she says, become more comfortable in uncertainty, and remain present and active in the midst of fear and grief. Her clients usually struggle with this task in one of two ways, she said: they tend to be activists who can&#x27;t acknowledge their feelings or people so aware of their feelings that they fail to act.

This once-in-a-generation, groundbreaking, brilliant legal scholar and fighter for the public interest, the slayer of Reaganomics, has attracted more vitriol, mockery, and dismissal than any of her predecessors in living memory. She sure must be doing something right, huh? A quick refresher. In 2017, Khan – then a law student – published Amazon&#x27;s Antitrust Paradox in the Yale Law Journal. It was a brilliant, blistering ana…</p>

                  <p>In this video from Architectural Digest, architect Michael Wyetzner runs us through why American diners look the way they do. Early diners took their cues from trains:
So let&#x27;s take a look at a typical American diner. So the outside has a shape that&#x27;s reminiscent of a train. In fact, that&#x27;s how diners got their name. They&#x27;re named after the dining car on a train.
Many of the design elements in a diner are based on the necessities of dining on a train in a railroad car, like booth seating and counter seating, and an open kitchen.
So I like these two photos because they show all the elements that go into the classic American diner. On the exterior, you have that stainless steel smooth curvature, you&#x27;ve got that Art Deco typography. And then on the interior you have the checkered floor, you have the booths, you have the globes, and you have the jukebox.
In the early part of the 20th century, trains were the dominant form of travel. If you look at some of the earliest diners, they were in fact, actual train cars that were placed permanently on the ground.


Later, cars and space travel provided inspiration in the diner&#x27;s evolution.

You can only be secure from some threat. A fire alarm won&#x27;t protect you from burglaries. A condom won&#x27;t protect you from mass shootings. It seems obvious, but how often do we hear about &quot;security&quot; without any mention of who is being made secure, and from which threat? Take the US welfare system. It is very …</p>

                  <p>The Friar&#x27;s Club was founded in 1904 and, like other private social clubs of the era, their membership was male-only. Women could visit as guests but only after 4pm and the club didn&#x27;t admit its first woman as a member until Liza Minnelli in 1987.
One of the club&#x27;s biggest traditions was its closed-door luncheon roasts of celebrities, which over the years included roasts of Humphrey Bogart, Johnny Carson, Milton Berle, Redd Foxx, and Bruce Willis.1 A few women were roasted before 1987 (Lucille Ball, Martha Raye, Barbra Streisand) but they were not allowed as guests. They even sent the waiters out of the room for the roasts.
In 1983, after months of planning, Phyllis Diller dressed up as a man (named Phillip Downey) and attended the roast of Sid Caesar (she&#x27;s on the left in the photo above with her co-conspirator, Howard Rosen). Here are a pair of videos of Diller talking about her infiltration. To be fair, the Friar&#x27;s Club didn&#x27;t seem that mad at her because they roasted her just two years later.

In 2004, the club roasted Donald Trump (roastmaster was Regis Philbin) and the next year Trump served as roastmaster for Don King. What a weird time/place/thing.↩

                  <p>This is great: The Cut asked 100 people to scream as loud as they could in front of a camera. For some, it was cathartic while others found it uncomfortable. Some folks didn&#x27;t know how to scream which I don&#x27;t entirely understand?
This video reminded me a lot of Ten Meter Tower, one of my all-time favorite short documentaries, in which dozens of people are filmed jumping from a 10-meter diving platform for the first time. Both videos deal with inner vs. outer selves and people&#x27;s comfort with expressing vulnerability. (via colossal)

                  <p>I&#x27;ve been branching out from my usual Game Boy folly and have been tinkering with the Wonder Swan (an interesting little Japanese exclusive handheld). The original Wonder Swan can do eight shades of grey and has no backlight (very much like the original Game Boys for viewing).
Given my experience with Game Boys and recent (basic) electronics, I thought I&#x27;d try my hand at a backlight mod (where LEDs are used light up behind the display). I&#x27;m pretty happy with the final result and this is how I did it.

Build steps
For the backlight, I used a faulty DS Lite display - both bottom or top screen will work as we&#x27;re only interested in the LED and filters.

From the DS Lite display, remove the metal shielding from the back, remove the front polarizer (I&#x27;m guessing) and then separate the back (whit…</p>

                  <p>For the last few years, Amazon has spent a couple of summer days putting a bunch of their most popular items on sale for their Prime members. This year, Prime Day runs from July 11-12 and includes a number of things that I can personally recommend (or are currently coveting). Keep in mind that you need to be an Amazon Prime member to take advantage of these deals: here&#x27;s where you sign up for Prime if you&#x27;re interested (there&#x27;s a free 30-day trial).
Ok first, there are a bunch of deals on Apple products, including the 2nd-generation AirPods Pro (20% off) that I am a big fan of. (That&#x27;s actually not a Prime-only deal, but it&#x27;s $50 cheaper than Apple sells them for.) The AirPods Max are $100 off, the 2nd-gen AirPods are just $90 (30% off), and the 3rd-gen AirPods are $30 off.

This short video is an excerpt from a longer livestream Finnbogason did — here&#x27;s another short excerpt that shows just how large the eruption is and how close some people are getting to it:

He&#x27;s starting another livestream of the eruption in just a few minutes here (at 2:30pm ET) if you&#x27;d like to follow along.

                  <p>There&#x27;s a small moment in second-to-last episode of the season two of The Bear (extremely mild spoilers) that I liked even though you blink and you&#x27;ll miss it. One of the new chefs is tentatively salting some steaks and Sydney says &quot;I need you to salt that like a sidewalk&quot;. Cut to Carmy, who walks up muttering &quot;Where&#x27;d you grow up, Arizona?&quot;, takes the salt, and absolutely just drenches the steaks in salt. And I was like, yeah, that&#x27;s how you salt a steak!
Several years ago, I started noticing in various cooking videos how much salt chefs put in &amp; on food, particularly meat. I already knew that ample salting was important to the flavor, but I hadn&#x27;t realized that I wasn&#x27;t going far enough. I was being timid with my salting, afraid of oversalting and ruining dinner. Around this time, I read a Wired piece by chef David Chang about his Unified Theory of Deliciousness and I&#x27;ve been following his recommendation about salting food ever since:
My first breakthrough on this idea was with salt. It&#x27;s the most basic ingredient, but it can also be hellishly complex. A chef can go crazy figuring out how much salt to add to a dish. But I believe there is an objectively correct amount of salt, and it is rooted in a counterintuitive idea. Normally we think of a balanced dish as being neither too salty nor undersalted. I think that&#x27;s wrong. When a dish is perfectly seasoned, it will taste simultaneously like it has too much salt and too little salt. It is fully committed to being both at the same time.


This is the way. You&#x27;ll screw it up sometimes and go overboard, but if you can consistently get right up to that edge, your food will taste the best it possibly can. This works particularly well with steaks and burgers...my burger went from &quot;pretty good&quot; to &quot;holy shit&quot; solely on the application of the proper amount of salt.

                  <p>Hey folks. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve read about the heavy rains and the flooding in the Northeast, particularly in New York and Vermont. My town here in central VT did not flood last night (though some area fields may have) and appears to be out of danger but other places around me were not so lucky.
In particular, I&#x27;m stunned by the several feet of water that are currently covering Montpelier, the capital of Vermont and a place that I know pretty well. This is a video from late last night and early this morning of someone paddling around downtown Montpelier, surveying the flooding and interviewing locals:

The water is not rushing, just standing, and there is almost no one around — there&#x27;s an eerie quiet that&#x27;s punctuated by the sounds of alarms going off all around. And there&#x27;s just so much water.…</p>

                  <p>Craig Mod recently finished a 16-day tour of jazz kissas in northern Japan. Jazz kissas are bar/cafes where one goes to listen to jazz, mostly on records and not live. Mod loosely defies them thusly:
Mostly defined as: Mid-20th century &quot;listening cafes&quot; for jazz music. But there is a lot of variance in this definition. Lots are coffee-focused cafes, fitting into the broader &quot;kissaten&quot; universe. But some are more bar-like, and some even jazz clubs (but for the most part, live music is rare). You can tie yourself in knots splitting hairs over this stuff. Though they&#x27;re traditionally known as &quot;jazz kissa&quot; — the shortened version of &quot;kissaten&quot; (fear not: even if you call them &quot;jazz kissaten&quot; you won&#x27;t suddenly turn into a pillar of salt). Some are seventy years old. Some forty. Some are five years old. The important defining element is simply: A presiding and effusive ever-abiding love for jazz, jazz, and more jazz.


At each stop, he recorded the ambient sounds of each kissa so that you can experience a little bit of the atmosphere at these places — here&#x27;s the full playlist. The recordings were done with a pair of microphones so that the audio is in stereo. This sounds great with a good pair of headphones!

                  </ul>
                  <p>In a piece from January, Cory Doctorow outlined the enshittification lifecycle of online platforms:
Here is how platforms die: First, they are good to their users; then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers; finally, they abuse those business customers to claw back all the value for themselves. Then, they die.
...
This is enshittification: Surpluses are first directed to users; then, once they&#x27;re locked in, surpluses go to suppliers; then once they&#x27;re locked in, the surplus is handed to shareholders and the platform becomes a useless pile of shit. From mobile app stores to Steam, from Facebook to Twitter, this is the enshittification lifecycle.


Taking note of various platforms lighting themselves on fire recently, Mike Masnick offers a list of rules for the leadership of these platforms to follow to avoid turning into dumpster fires. Here&#x27;s rule #3:
Create more value than you capture. This one is not mine, but Tim O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s, and it&#x27;s one that constantly sticks with me. As you&#x27;re developing a business model, the best way to make sure that you&#x27;re serving your users best, and not enshittifying everything, is to constantly make sure that you&#x27;re only capturing some of the value you&#x27;re creating, and are instead putting much more out into the world, especially for your community. Your investors will push you to capture more and more of that value, but again, when you start chasing that, you&#x27;re also spiraling down the enshittification curve.


IMO, some of what is going on with Twitter &amp; Reddit is not enshittification per se, but more of a pushback against the power of their users. (I always think of Tron in instances like these. &quot;I fight for the users!&quot;) I think these CEOs know on some level that they&#x27;re making their product worse, but bringing their user bases to heel is worth the short-term headaches.

                  <p>Hello! Here’s a new entry in the “cool software julia likes” section.
A little while ago I started using a Mac, and one of my biggest
frustrations with it is that often I need to run Linux-specific software. For
example, the nginx playground I
posted about the other day only works on Linux because it uses Linux namespaces (via bubblewrap)
to sandbox nginx. And I’m working on another playground right now that uses bubblewrap too.
This post is very short, it’s just to say that Lima seems nice and much simpler
to get started with than Vagrant.
enter Lima!
I was complaining about this to a friend, and they mentioned
Lima, which stands for Linux on Mac. I’d heard
of colima (another way to run Linux
containers on Mac), but I hadn’t realized that Lima also just lets you run VMs.
It was surprising…</p>

                  <p>Hello! In 2021 I released a small playground for testing nginx configurations
called nginx playground. There’s a
blog post about it here.
This is an extremely short post to say that at the time I didn’t make it open source,
but I am making it open source now. It’s not a lot of code but maybe it’ll be
interesting to someone.
Here’s the github repo. The
frontend is in static/ and the backend is in api/. The README is mostly an
extended apology for the developer experience and note that the project is
unmaintained. But I did test that the build instructions work!
why didn’t I open source this before?
I’m not very good at open source. Some of the problems I have with open sourcing things are:
I dislike (and am very bad at) maintaining open source projects – I usually
ignore basically all feature requests and most bug reports and then feel bad about it.
I handed off maintainership to both of the open source projects that I
started (rbspy and rust-bcc) to other people who are doing a MUCH better job than I ever did.
Sometimes the developer experience for the project is pretty bad
Sometimes there’s configuration in the project (like the fly.toml or the
analytics I have set up) which don’t really make sense for other people to
copy
new approach: don’t pretend I’m going to improve it
In the past I’ve had some kind of belief that I’m going to improve the problems
with my code later. But I haven’t touched this project in more than a year and
I think it’s unlikely I’m going to go back to it unless it breaks in some dramatic way.
So instead of pretending I’m going to improve things, I decided to just:
tell people in the README that the project is unmaintained
write down all the security caveats I know about
test the build instructions I wrote to make sure that they work (on a fresh machine, even!)
explain (but do not fix!!) some of the messy parts of the project
that’s all!
Maybe I will open source more of my tiny projects in the future, we’ll see!
Thanks to Sumana Harihareswara for helping me
think through this.</p>

                  <p>I just finished reading Octavia Butler&#x27;s Parable of the Sower (so good!) and while doing a little customary post-read research on it, I discovered that Butler wrote a sequel in 1998 called Parable of the Talents and, uh... (from Wikipedia):
The novel is set against the backdrop of a dystopian United States that has come under the grip of a Christian fundamentalist denomination called &quot;Christian America&quot; led by President Andrew Steele Jarret. Seeking to restore American power and prestige, and using the slogan &quot;Make America Great Again&quot;, Jarret embarks on a crusade to cleanse America of non-Christian faiths. Slavery has resurfaced with advanced &quot;shock collars&quot; being used to control slaves. Virtual reality headsets known as &quot;Dreamasks&quot; are also popular since they enable wearers to escape their harsh reality.


Well, our present reality certainly checks a remarkable number of those boxes, including an absolute bullseye on &quot;Make America Great Again&quot;.

                  <p>Not going to bury the lede here: this is a straight-up masterpiece and maybe the best thing I&#x27;ve seen all week. Hidari is a stop-motion animation of an inventive fight sequence between a lone warrior/craftsman and a boss &amp; his minions. The vibe of the animation is at once halting and buttery smooth, a combination that&#x27;s wonderfully expressive. Directed by Masashi Kawamura, the plan is to turn this into a feature-length film:
This is a pilot version of the stop-motion samurai film that tells the story of &quot;Jingoro Hidari,&quot; a legendary Edo-era craftsman. All the characters are made by wood and animated frame by frame, just like how Jingoro&#x27;s wooden sculptures came to life in his many anecdotes. We hope you enjoy this film, which mixes dynamic actions as seen in Japanimation, and the rich analog expressions of stop-motion animation.
Our intention is to use this pilot film as a starting point to create a full length feature film. We have started activities to raise the necessary partners and funding to achieve this goal.


Take my money! (P.S. Turn on subtitles if you don&#x27;t speak Japanese. Oh, and here&#x27;s a behind-the-scenes look at how they did the animation.)

Turns out, it is what we want; this piece is brilliant. But it&#x27;s also unexplainable, so I&#x27;ll just post these three snippets and let you work out whether you want to read the rest of it or not.
As I read, I thought Wallace must have been taken by something very simple, the smallest sensual fact: that as an IRS worker you are issued a new social security number, in essence a new identity, a chance to start over. The old number, the old life, &#x27;simply disappeared, from an identification standpoint&#x27;. A whole novel could take flesh from that fact, one about the idea of bureaucratic identity as opposed to …</p>

                  <p>Yesterday I posted about the 2023 Drone Photo Awards and one of my favorite shots was of a playground/park in Poland. My curious pal Neven tracked down more information about the park and, well, it&#x27;s so cool and cute!



Here&#x27;s part of the description from the park&#x27;s creators, SLAS Architects:
&quot;Activity zone&quot; is a multifunctional public space which is the first phase of regeneration and integration of the University of Silesia campus with the urban tissue of Chorzów City.
The site is located in the place of the demolished military building with a number of old existing trees. &quot;Activity zone&quot; is designed as concrete platform strongly perforated and filled with a diverse programme that includes: students leisure zone, children&#x27;s play devices, fitness, individually designed elements of street furniture and greenery including all existing trees. Some parts of the garden are possible to develop by local seniors. The platform connects the diverse program, intensifies the use of the place and becomes itself an element of play. Variety of attractions enhance interactions between users of all age groups and integrates academic community with local inhabitants and the surrounding nature.


My only complaint: it&#x27;s maybe a little too small? But otherwise: top marks.

                  <p>Oh boy. I thought the teaser trailer was good, but the full trailer for Martin Scorsese&#x27;s Killers of the Flower Moon just dropped and I am. So. Excited. To. SEE. THIS!
At the turn of the 20th century, oil brought a fortune to the Osage Nation, who became some of the richest people in the world overnight. The wealth of these Native Americans immediately attracted white interlopers, who manipulated, extorted, and stole as much Osage money as they could before resorting to murder.


Once again, it&#x27;s based on David Grann&#x27;s Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI, which I highly recommend. Grann + Scorsese appears to be a potent combination — the latter is already signed on to adapt Grann&#x27;s latest bestseller, The Wager.

                  <p>I am a sucker for aerial photography, so I had a lot of fun looking through all the winners and runners-up of the 2023 Drone Photo Awards. As usual, I picked out a few favorites and included them above. From top to bottom, photos by: Sebastian Piórek (a very tidy Polish playground), Gheorghe Popa (amazing abstract shot), Matias Delacroix (a border crossing between Haiti and the Dominican Republic), and Brad Weiner (surfer).

                  <p>Illustrator Kevan Atteberry created the Clippy character that was introduced in Microsoft Office 97. There was a ton of backlash when the character was introduced, but as time has passed, many people have begun to think fondly of him. 
He&#x27;s a guy that just wants to help, and he&#x27;s a little bit too helpful sometimes. And there&#x27;s something fun and vulnerable about that.

                  <p>Astrophotographer Cari Letelier caught this amazing shot of the aurora borealis over the Goðafoss waterfall in Iceland. We live in a truly magical world — if science fiction authors made something like this up, you wouldn&#x27;t believe it&#x27;d ever be real. You can check out more of Letelier&#x27;s astrophotography on Instagram or on her website.
I found this via the Astronomy Picture of the Day site, a gem of the old school web that&#x27;s been sharing astronomy photos since 1995.

                  <p>One thing I am not good at is write in superlatives about myself. That’s a good thing, I think? But often you are asked to big yourself up for some official publication or marketing materials. So I thought I give ChatGPT a go to turn a list of facts about myself into a big-up intro. […]</p>

                  <p>Precise. Symmetric. Stylized. Controlled (often bright) color palette. Slow-motion. Lateral tracking. These are all hallmarks of Wes Anderson&#x27;s films. But as this short video from Luís Azevedo shows, there are plenty of imperfect moments in his movies as well. Anderson is a canny filmmaker and it&#x27;s the contrast between the controlled worlds he constructs and these more frenetic, off-kilter, imperfect moments that gives them their weight and impact.

                  <p>Photographs have always been an imperfect reproduction of real life — see the story of Dorothea Lange&#x27;s Migrant Mother or Ansel Adams&#x27; extensive dark room work — but the seemingly boundless alterations offered by current &amp; future AI editing tools will allow almost anyone to turn their photos (or should I say &quot;photos&quot;) into whatever they wish. In this video, Evan Puschak briefly explores what AI-altered photos might do to our memories.
I was surprised he didn&#x27;t mention the theory that when a past experience is remembered, that memory is altered in the human brain — that is, &quot;very act of remembering can change our memories&quot;. I think I first heard about this on Radiolab more than 16 years ago. So maybe looking at photos extensively altered by AI could extensively alter those same memories in …</p>

                  <p>Greek photographer Anthimos Ntagkas stalks the streets in search of visual coincidences to capture and put on his Instagram account. My Modern Met talked to Ntagkas about his process:
Nowadays, I don&#x27;t choose the place, but I make every location work for me. I combine people with elements everywhere I stand. Luckily the themes in this type of photography are endless, and I never lose interest.

                  <p>After my wrangle with getting a timezone from an IP address by reducing large databases down from several hundred megabytes down to only a few, then discovering IPv6 didn&#x27;t work (so I then applied my same logic to get 700MB to 10MB), the ever lovely Phil Hawksworth pointed out that (of course) Netlify has this data available in their edge functions.
I totally overlooked the feature (maybe I didn&#x27;t even look!). So let&#x27;s implement that and then discover the glaring bug in all of the code so far.

Netlify edge function&#x27;s geo prop
Phil kindly sent me a direct message on Space Karen&#x27;s website pointing me to the geo property provided in edge function calls.
This (of course 🤦‍♂️) means the code for the function is (for me) stupid simple:
export default async (request, context) &#x3D;&gt; {

                  <p>Hey everyone! This is the list of all the changes we&#x27;ve done to our projects and apps during the month of June. We&#x27;ll also be reporting in our on position in the world, and on our future plans.
Summary Of Changes
100r.co, added propeller maintenance, Maple Bay, Telegraph Cove, Smuggler Cove and Princess Louisa Inlet.
Wiktopher, added back the revised/corrected version of Chapter 10, back online, and Chapter 11 has been corrected but is not yet live.
UxnFor, created an uxntal code formatter.
Bicycle, added lots of little improvements.
Adelie, added speaker&#x27;s notes and a pen mode.
News
Pino spent the first few days of the month on land, having its bottom re-painted, and its various bits serviced and checked. We took our propeller apart for the first time.
We&#x27;ve added a few write-ups of our travels so far (see above entry with links under 100r.co), but the most significant one is our 46nmi sail up to Princess Louisa Inlet, a long fjord on British Columbia&#x27;s Sunshine Coast, with an incredible gem at the end. It is an amazing, and unique place. We&#x27;re glad we finally got to go. As we write this, we are in Roscoe Bay on West Redonda Island, tethering off a phone hoisted up the mast (it works quite well).
This summer we are power stable. We had issues last year because of parisitic draws due to old wiring (see DC electrical refit), but now everything is working as it should. We&#x27;re charging our computers without an inverter, and that too is working out quite well so far (see charging electronics).
Together, Hikari and Lynn made chibicc-uxn, a c compiler for Uxn, and with it also released a port of the classic software Neko(xneko, oneko sakura).
Pino book &amp; movie club
We are reading Arkady and Boris Strugatsky&#x27;s Roadside Picnic. We&#x27;ve been re-watching Kaamelott for the hundredth time.

                  <p>So, ever since I&#x27;d heard that Bill Murray had to drop out of filming Asteroid City, I&#x27;ve wondered which role he&#x27;d meant to play. After seeing the movie, I thought it was either the grandfather (played by Tom Hanks) or the hotel manager (Steve Carell) and it was Carell&#x27;s role:
Murray was originally cast as a motel manager in the desert town where the movie is set, in 1955. &quot;Normally, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s such a nice idea to tell everyone the person who didn&#x27;t end up in the movie,&quot; Anderson said recently. &quot;But Bill got covid in Ireland, and it was four days before he was supposed to work.&quot; Murray was in Ireland for a family trip (&quot;And usually golf has something to do with it,&quot; Anderson said), en route to Spain, where &quot;Asteroid City&quot; was shooting.

You can circumvent the need to login by changing twitter.com to nitter.it though.

                  <p>Elie Mystal writing for the Nation on the Supreme Court&#x27;s recent decision that declared affirmative action in college admissions unconstitutional.
But the death of affirmative action was not achieved merely through the machinations of Republican lawyers. While conservatives on the Supreme Court delivered the fatal blow, the policy has long been made vulnerable by the soft bigotry of parents, whose commitment to integration and equality turns cold the moment their little cherubs fail to get into their first choice of college or university. If you want to see a white liberal drop the pretense that they care about systemic racism and injustice, just tell them that their privately tutored kid didn&#x27;t get into whatever &quot;elite&quot; school they were hoping for. If you want to make an immigrant family adopt a Klansman&#x27;s view of the intelligence, culture, and work ethic of Black folks, tell them that their kid&#x27;s standardized test scores are not enough to guarantee entry into ivy-draped halls of power. Some of the most horribly racist claptrap folks have felt comfortable saying to my face has been said in the context of people telling me why they don&#x27;t like affirmative action, or why my credentials are somehow &quot;unearned&quot; because they were &quot;given&quot; to me by affirmative action.
That last bit is in some ways the most devastating: Black people are attacked and shamed simply because the policy exists, regardless of whether it benefited them or not. I&#x27;ve had white folks whom I could standardize-test into a goddamn coma tell me that I got into school only because of affirmative action. I once talked to a white guy — whose parents&#x27; name was on one of the buildings on campus — who asked me how it felt to know I got &quot;extra help&quot; to get in. The sheer nerve of white folks is sometimes jaw-dropping.


I recommended this yesterday in a Quick Link, but Scene On Radio&#x27;s episode of their Seeing White series on White Affirmative Action is great.

                  <p>From TasteAtlas, a listing of the 150 Most Legendary Restaurants in the World &amp; Their Iconic Dishes. These aren&#x27;t necessarily the best restaurants on Earth, but places that have &quot;withstood the test of time, eschewing trendy gimmicks in favor of traditional, high-quality cuisine&quot;.
Here are a few of the entries from the list that I&#x27;ve either been to or would like to go to someday (ok, almost the whole list would have qualified for that):
2. Katz&#x27;s Delicatessen (pastrami on rye)
Schwartz&#x27;s is iconic, but I think Snowdon Deli has better smoked meat. In the same vein, I&#x27;ve had good steak and not-so-good steak at Luger&#x27;s — as far as an iconic NYC steakhouse goes, I would have gone for Keen&#x27;s.
I&#x27;m sure any food fan worth their (don&#x27;t say it, don&#x27;t say it) salt (ugh) could come up with a few dozen restaurants that could/should be on this list, but 150 is certainly a good start! Soba, bratwurst, ćevapi, udon, churrasco, kofte, phở, ramen, ceviche, sushi, risotto, bouillabaisse, dim sum, BBQ, Peking duck, biryani, xiao long bao...man, I&#x27;m so hungry now!

                  </ul>
                  <p>From Rabbi Danya Ruttenberg, a piece on the still-radical teachings of Fred Rogers, who emphasized the &quot;love thy neighbor&quot; part of the Bible rather than the twisted &quot;persecute the other&quot; version that has taken hold in so-called Christian communities in America over the past few decades.
Fred Rogers was a Presbyterian minister whose life&#x27;s work was, I believe, built almost entirely (if not entirely) around Leviticus 19:18: &quot;Love your neighbor as yourself: I am God.&quot; Hence... the neighborhood. In practice it that looked like this (all of these are his words): &quot;To love someone is to strive to accept that person exactly the way [they are], right here and now.&quot; and &quot;Everyone longs to be loved. And the greatest thing we can do is to let people know that they are loved and capable of loving.&quot;


Part of his philosophy was acknowledging that, because we loved them, we needed to have truthful, difficult conversations with our children. 
When Bobby Kennedy was murdered that same year, he did something that&#x27;s pretty much impossible to our world today.
He had a puppet tiger ask an actor:
&quot;What does &#x27;assassination&#x27; mean?&quot;
He knew that small children would be hearing this word, and that they would be aware that something major had happened. And that most of the time, when adults are preoccupied with communal tragedy and trauma, children get left out-to their own detriment.
Better they should know, in an age-appropriate way, and be given the tools to cope, than to be left out in the cold, as he put it, &quot;at the mercy of their own imaginations.&quot;
Again, naming true things and simply holding space to let children deal with them — rather than trying to hide or minimize or gaslight because it seems too hard.
That&#x27;s love.

                  <p>The Verge has published a list of the 40 best nonfiction books about &quot;tech&quot; (which relates to the industry centered around Silicon Valley &amp; the internet and not technology in general). I was pleased to see Broad Band: The Untold Story of the Women Who Made the Internet by Claire Evans and Small Fry by Lisa Brennan-Jobs on there, as well as Close to the Machine: Technophilia and Its Discontents by Ellen Ullman and Neil Postman&#x27;s Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology. I&#x27;m baffled that Tracy Kidder&#x27;s amazing The Soul of a New Machine didn&#x27;t make the top 5 or even 10.
But reading through the rest of the list, it occurred to me that I don&#x27;t really read tech books — and if I did, I didn&#x27;t get a whole lot from them. When I was younger and trying to understand the industry and momentous period I was participating in, I generally looked to books outside of tech as guides. I read things like How Buildings Learn by Steward Brand, The Death and Life of Great American Cities by Jane Jacobs, Chaos by James Gleick, The Timeless Way of Building by Christopher Alexander, and Understanding Comics by Scott McCloud.
Anyway, back to the list — it seems incomplete in a way that I can&#x27;t quite articulate. I would have liked to have seen Tom Standage&#x27;s The Victorian Internet on there. What else? I would like to hear about your favorite books about tech (or non-tech books that are sneakily about tech anyway) or what you think might be missing from the list. Leave your thoughts in the comments!

                  <p>This week I decided it was time to try to revive some of the casualties from my recent Vercel incident, and though webmentions.app is the more useful, I though I&#x27;d start with the, so I thought, low hanging fruit - &quot;how many days to Christmas&quot;.
It turned into 3 days of complicated problem solving and working against systems that just didn&#x27;t want to work the way I needed.

The context
I have a little app that runs on a internet connected clock that shows the days to Christmas. A little while ago, during December and Jan, the traffic (along with traffic on webmentions.app) spiked hard enough to cause Vercel to block my entire account.
So for the short term, I disabled the countdown app. Christmas, at the time, was a full year away, so I figured it wouldn&#x27;t be missed.

                  <p>The Chickening is a surreal visual remix of Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s The Shining done by Nick DenBoer and Davy Force. It mostly defies description, so just watch the first minute or so (after which you won&#x27;t be able to resist the rest of it). The short film is playing at this year&#x27;s Sundance Film Festival.
But seriously, WTF was that?! (via @UnlikelyWorlds)

                  <p>The other day I posted about how contemporary filmmakers, Wes Anderson in particular, use miniatures in their films. The model/prop maker featured, Simon Weisse, has worked with Anderson on several films, including his latest, Asteroid City. Weisse has been posting behind-the-scenes shots of his studio&#x27;s work on Asteroid City to his under-followed Instagram account and I thought a separate post highlighting some of those props and miniatures would be fun.





This video shows a bunch more of the miniatures used in the movie:

I also ran across a few behind-the-scenes videos of the production if you&#x27;re in the mood to deep-dive (as I appear to be):




If you&#x27;re lucky enough to be in London in the next week and a half, you can go and see some of these props and sets and even eat at the diner at 180 Studios. Very. Jealous.

                  <p>From the Library of Congress, footage of the first gay pride march in NYC in 1970. The march, called the Christopher Street Liberation Day Parade, was held on June 28 to commemorate the first anniversary of the Stonewall Uprising. From Gothamist:
The Christopher Street Gay Liberation Day March started in Greenwich Village at about 2 p.m. that day in 1970, just outside the Stonewall Inn, which was then for rent, having closed the previous October.
As they gathered, the marchers were few, and brave. There were groups from Washington, DC and Boston, college organizations from Rutgers, Yale and Columbia. Some transgender people who were there at the time said that organizers asked them to march in the back, but they refused.
&quot;The trans community said, &#x27;Hell no, we won&#x27;t go.&#x27; We fought for this as much as you did, or even started it,&quot; said Victoria Cruz. &quot;And we just mingled throughout the crowd. There was no trans contingent. We just mingled.&quot;
They started walking very briskly up Christopher Street, because they were scared. There had been bomb threats. People worried they would be shot at, or harassed again by the police. Martin Boyce was there, and he says that afterwards they joked it was &quot;the first run.&quot;
&quot;I was worried about being single file, because I just watched a program on National Geographic about wildebeests and I saw how the ones on the side were picked off. So I thought I would stay in the middle — but there was no middle.&quot;


As the march went on, it gathered people &amp; momentum and they eventually made it without major incident to Central Park.

                  <p>When you write some code and put it on a spacecraft headed into the far reaches of space, you need to it work, no matter what. Mistakes can mean loss of mission or even loss of life. In 2006, Gerard Holzmann of the NASA/JPL Laboratory for Reliable Software wrote a paper called The Power of 10: Rules for Developing Safety-Critical Code. The rules focus on testability, readability, and predictability:
Avoid complex flow constructs, such as goto and recursion.
All loops must have fixed bounds. This prevents runaway code.
Avoid heap memory allocation.
Restrict functions to a single printed page.
Use a minimum of two runtime assertions per function.
Restrict the scope of data to the smallest possible.
Check the return value of all non-void functions, or cast to void to indicate the return value…</p>

Curiously, though, we do seem to be able to edit objects and arrays that are created using “const”.

                  <p>My pal Clive Thompson, who is in the midst of a two-part bicycle ride across the United States and is writing a book on micromobility, thinks local, state, and federal governments should start offering substantial subsidies for e-bikes in order to help reduce car usage, decrease urban pollution, and to lower the cost of transportation for lower-income families.
The thing is, we should lean heavily into subsidies for electric bikes — now.
If Denver&#x27;s experience is any guide, it&#x27;d be a huge boon for town, cities, and even many suburbs. Ebikes can&#x27;t be used to replace all car travel, of course; but as folks who experiment with them discover, wow, you start leaving your car at home a lot. If towns and cities are smart about how they organize and issue these credits, they can also help lower-in…</p>

Our phones come with pre-installed apps, our laptops have their own browsers. But in real life, we can choose to go to our local ethical […]

                  <p>Yuri Suzuki&#x27;s The Ambient Machine is a device for creating atmosphere, playing ambient sounds. The machine has 32 toggle switches on it; each switch actives a different sound (waves, running water, birds, wind, white noise) that you can blend to create your perfect aural backdrop.
The Ambient Machine provides us with a variety of sounds and music that we can use to design our own background ambience. White noise can mask unpleasant sounds around us and give us a sense of relief, Natural sounds can provide the feeling of relocating to a new environment, providing a break from the environments we have been confined to, and musical rhythms can provide patterns for us to find stability with.


Only 20 models of the original machine were created and sold, but you can preorder a slightly different version for ¥143,000 (~$1,000).

                  <p>In 1990, the US government sent $20,000 and a formal letter of apology to more than 82,000 Japanese Americans who were incarcerated in concentration camps during World War II. Morgan Ome, whose grandfather was imprisoned and got a check, looks at the effect this had on those who received it and how the reparative process might look for other communities (Black and Native Americans).
In one of the letters, the daughter of an incarceree tells how the $20,000, invested in her family&#x27;s home equity and compounded over time, ultimately enabled her to attend Yale. &quot;The redress money my family received has always been a tailwind at my back, making each step of the way a tiny bit easier,&quot; she wrote. Just as her family was able to build generational equity, she hoped that Black Americans, too, would…</p>

                  <p>Vox talks to prop &amp; model maker Simon Weisse, who made miniatures for Wes Anderson&#x27;s Asteroid City, about the perhaps surprising popularity of miniatures in contemporary filmmaking, when the technique works and when it doesn&#x27;t (e.g. when unscalable elements like rain or fire/explosions are involved), and why certain directors use it instead of CGI.
Miniatures in movies are way more common than you may realize, and one of the most stylish filmmakers keeping them alive is Wes Anderson. In this video we spoke to Simon Weisse, prop maker and model marker for some of Wes Anderson&#x27;s recent projects, like The Grand Budapest Hotel, The French Dispatch, and Asteroid City.
Older movies, like 1977&#x27;s Star Wars: Episode IV — A New Hope, had no choice but to use miniatures to make their worlds feel real. But even in the modern day of CGI, filmmakers are still using minis — just look at projects like The Mandalorian, Blade Runner 2049, Harry Potter, and The Dark Knight series. In those movies, miniatures are used for expansive sets that establish the world of a film, otherworldly vehicles like spaceships, and more.


It&#x27;s perfect for Anderson&#x27;s storybook aesthetic, of course...it looks great in Asteroid City (which I really enjoyed overall).

                  <p>This is apparently extremely old news (like almost 20 years old), but I ran across the cover that Chris Ware did for Voltaire&#x27;s Candide in the bookstore yesterday and it still slaps.
P.S. The book covers tag is pretty good if you want to get distracted/inspired by fantastic design for 30 minutes.

                  <p>Hello! On Wednesday, we released a new zine: How Integers and Floats Work!
You can get it for $12 here:

an 13-pack of all my zines here.
Here’s the cover:

Here’s the table of contents!

  
Now let’s talk about some of the motivations for writing this zine!
motivation 1: demystify binary
I wrote this zine because I used to find binary data really impenetrable. There
are all these 0s and 1s! What does it mean?
But if you look at any binary file format, most of it is integers! For example,
if you look at the DNS parsing in Implement DNS in a Weekend, it’s all about encoding and
decoding a bunch of integers (plus some ASCII strings, which arguably are also arrays of integers).
So I think that learning how integers w…</p>

                  <p>Or rather, protozoan? Toxoplasma gondii is a protozoan parasite which is transmitted from rodents to cats through a crafty mechanism...it makes mice attracted to the smell of cat urine. Mouse goes near cat, cat eats mouse, T. gondii has a new host. From cats, the parasite can jump into humans, where it may be responsible for all sorts of nastiness:
Well, the behavioral influence plays out in a number of strange ways. Toxoplasma infection in humans has been associated with everything from slowed reaction times to a fondness toward cat urine — to more extreme behaviors such as depression and even schizophrenia. And here&#x27;s the kicker: Two different research groups have independently shown that Toxo-infected individuals are three to four times as likely of being killed in car accidents due to reckless driving.

	
And maybe makes us want to invent networking technology and share cool links? In this five-minute talk, Kevin Slavin cleverly connects viral media with T. gondii:

That video was so good, I watched the whole thing twice.

                  <p>The creepy twins. Jack feverish at the typewriter. Danny riding his Big Wheel through carpeted hallways. The elevators of blood. These familiar scenes from Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s horror classic The Shining (and several more) have been recreated in this Lego stop-motion animation. The video took 50-60 hours over a three-week period to make and was an exercise in constraints:
&quot;Mostly, it came down to choosing the right pieces,&quot; he says. &quot;I made this movie only with pieces I already had in my collection, so I had to do with just what I had laying around. For instance, the famous carpet pattern in the hallway could have been more realistic, but with the pieces I had, it became a little more abstract. I went with clay for the bloody elevator scene also because I do not have thousands of red translucent pieces.&quot;

                  <p>I loved Liu Cixin&#x27;s The Three-Body Problem trilogy (read it twice!) and was excited/apprehensive when Netflix announced they&#x27;d partnered with Game of Thrones showrunners D.B. Weiss and David Benioff to adapt the books into a TV series. Well, the first trailer is here and has tipped my scales more towards excited. Really looking forward to when this premieres in January 2024 — if they get it right, this could be something really special.

                  <p>Humility, a designer’s essential value—that has a nice ring to it. What about humility, an office manager’s essential value? Or a dentist’s? Or a librarian’s? They all sound great. When humility is our guiding light, the path is always open for fulfillment, evolution, connection, and engagement. In this chapter, we’re going to talk about why.
That said, this is a book for designers, and to that end, I’d like to start with a story—well, a journey, really. It’s a personal one, and I’m going to make myself a bit vulnerable along the way. I call it:
The Tale of Justin’s Preposterous Pate
When I was coming out of art school, a long-haired, goateed neophyte, print was a known quantity to me; design on the web, however, was rife with complexities to navigate and discover, a problem to be solved. …</p>

                  <p>Using the metaphor of a cancerous tumor as an unruly village, Kurzgesagt explains how cancer develops in the human body, how the body fights against it, and how, sometimes, the cancer develops into something unmanageable.
In a sense this tiny tumor is like a rogue town. Imagine a group of rebels in Brooklyn decided that they were no longer part of New York but started a new settlement called Tumor Town, which happens to  occupy the same space. The new city wants to grow, so it orders tons of steel beams, cement and drywall. New buildings follow no logic, are badly planned, ugly and dangerously crooked. They are built right in the middle of streets, on top of playgrounds and on existing  infrastructure. The old neighborhood is torn down or overbuilt to make room for new stuff. Many of the former residents are trapped in the  middle of it and begin to starve. This goes on for a while until the smell of death finally attracts attention. Building inspectors and police show up.

                  <p>On his YouTube channel this week, Phil Edwards explores the question of why all pop music radio stations in the US sound the same. The short answer is consolidation caused by deregulation but the longer answer is worth watching. And if you want more information, Edwards&#x27; list of sources in the video description is pretty extensive.

                  <p>Kurt Vonnegut is just the bee&#x27;s knees, isn&#x27;t he? Here&#x27;s a letter he wrote in 1973 to the head of the school board at Drake High School in North Dakota after the school burned all of its copies of Slaughterhouse-Five in the school&#x27;s furnace.
If you were to bother to read my books, to behave as educated persons would, you would learn that they are not sexy, and do not argue in favor of wildness of any kind. They beg that people be kinder and more responsible than they often are. It is true that some of the characters speak coarsely. That is because people speak coarsely in real life. Especially soldiers and hardworking men speak coarsely, and even our most sheltered children know that. And we all know, too, that those words really don&#x27;t damage children much. They didn&#x27;t damage us when we were young. It was evil deeds and lying that hurt us.

                  <p>Heidi Gustafson is the curator of Ochre Sanctuary, a collection of iron-based earths that are the oldest natural pigments used by humans. In her new Book of Earth, Gustafson details where these pigments come from and how to use them to create art. Here are a few images from the book and the Ochre Sanctuary:



Looks like a gorgeous book. Check out her Instagram for more colorful photos of ochres.

                  <p>The immense scale of the factory and the intense temperatures involved (along with a musical soundtrack that sounds like Interstellar by way of Philip Glass) makes this video about how rebar is made compelling viewing. There are several scenes from this video that would not be out of place in this collection of Real-Life Infrastructure That Looks Like Sci-Fi. And there&#x27;s a color gradient moment near the end that&#x27;s really lovely. (thx, alex)

                  <p>This conversation with musician Perfume Genius about his creative process is interesting throughout. This is something I relate to 1000%:
I&#x27;m good at making things, but not talking about why. I made them because I don&#x27;t know how to talk about why. The explanation is the thing I made.


This too is something I try to hold myself to:
I also just do it, you know what I mean? I just make shit. 90% of doing anything is doing it. Not to sound self-help-y, but when people are asking me for advice, my first thought is, you should just do it. You beat so many people already if you just actually make a finished thing.


I am still a perfectionist sort of person, but when your work entails publishing 10-20 things in public every single day, you have to let go of that. Good enough is better than nothing at all.
Embrace your inner little baby (with really good taste):
I essentially have to get back to feeling like I&#x27;m a little baby to make things that are good. A baby with really good taste.

                  <p>In the 60s and 70s, Howard Johnson&#x27;s was the largest restaurant chain in the US — the restaurants and their associated hotels were ubiquitous while travelling America&#x27;s roadways. So it made sense that when Stanley Kubrick needed a hospitality brand for the Earthlight Room on the space station circling Earth in 2001: A Space Odyssey, he reached for HoJo&#x27;s.
And of course, even in 1968, you had to do some sort of cross-promotion and, bizarrely, what Howard Johnson&#x27;s came up with was a 2001-themed children&#x27;s menu.

Even more weirdly, the menu is not about the movie itself, it&#x27;s about a family that goes to see the movie. The whole opening sequence with the apes is omitted entirely, as is the HAL 9000 (arguably the film&#x27;s main character) — I suspect the HoJo&#x27;s people didn&#x27;t get to see the entire movie while putting this together (as evidenced by the &quot;preview edition&quot; graphic in the bottom right corner of the menu&#x27;s cover). 

It&#x27;s cool to see scenes from the movie rendered in comics form:


You can see the entire menu here, including the activity page — just click on one of the images to enter slideshow mode. (via meanwhile)

                  <p>Mario Wienerroither takes music videos, strips out all the sound, and then foleys back in sound effects based on what people are doing in the video. You&#x27;ll get the gist after about 6 seconds of this Jamiroquai video:

Great stuff. He&#x27;s also done Nirvana&#x27;s Smells Like Teen Spirit, Prodigy&#x27;s Firestarter, and Queen&#x27;s I Want to Break Free. (via @faketv)

                  <p>Using data from the ESA&#x27;s Mars Express probe, the German Aerospace Center has released an enhanced color image of Mars that shows off the planet&#x27;s geology and mineral content better than the usual dusty red photos do. Here&#x27;s part of what you&#x27;re seeing:
It is well known that most of Mars is reddish in colour, due to the high amount of oxidised iron in the dust on its surface, earning it the nickname the &#x27;Red Planet&#x27;. But it is also immediately noticeable that a considerable region of Mars is rather dark, appearing bluish in colour in image 1. These regions represent greyish-blackish-bluish sands, which are volcanic in origin and form large, dark sand layers on Mars. They were primarily piled up by the wind to form imposing sand dunes or enormous dune fields on the floor of impact craters. These unweathered sands consist of dark, basaltic minerals, of which volcanic lava on Earth is also composed. Basalt is the most widespread volcanic rock on Earth — and in the Solar System. Earth&#x27;s ocean floor is made of basalt, as are the extinct volcanoes of the Eifel, Mount Etna in Sicily and volcanoes of the Hawaiian archipelago.


In my mind, the best bit is how much clearer you can see the various geographical features of the planet. (via bad astronomy)

                  <p>According to recent research from linguists Phillip Carter and Kristen D&#x27;Alessandro Merii, a new dialect of English is forming in South Florida. The dialect, distinct from Spanglish, is spoken English that borrows lexical and semantic rules translated from Spanish. Carter writes:
For example, we found people to use expressions such as &quot;get down from the car&quot; instead of &quot;get out of the car.&quot; This is based on the Spanish phrase &quot;bajar del carro,&quot; which translates, for speakers outside of Miami, as &quot;get out of the car.&quot; But &quot;bajar&quot; means &quot;to get down,&quot; so it makes sense that many Miamians think of &quot;exiting&quot; a car in terms of &quot;getting down&quot; and not &quot;getting out.&quot;
Locals often say &quot;married with,&quot; as in &quot;Alex got married with Jos&#x27;e,&quot; based on the Spanish &quot;casarse con&quot; — literally translated as &quot;married with.&quot; They&#x27;ll also say &quot;make a party,&quot; a literal translation of the Spanish &quot;hacer una fiesta.&quot;
We also found &quot;semantic calques,&quot; or loan translations of meaning. In Spanish, &quot;carne,&quot; which translates as &quot;meat,&quot; can refer to both all meat, or to beef, a specific kind of meat. We discovered local speakers saying &quot;meat&quot; to refer specifically to &quot;beef&quot; — as in, &quot;I&#x27;ll have one meat empanada and two chicken empanadas.&quot;


I particularly liked this one:
We found that some expressions were used only among the immigrant generation — for example, &quot;throw a photo,&quot; from &quot;tirar una foto,&quot; as a variation of &quot;take a photo.&quot;

                  <p>This short video from Vox takes a look at the recent Supreme Court decision that struck down a gerrymandered congressional map in Alabama. 
In 2013, a divided Supreme Court gutted one of the major pillars of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. In the 10 years since then, the court has moved even farther to the right. So when the Voting Rights Act came before the Supreme Court again in 2022, it didn&#x27;t look good for the law. But then something completely unexpected happened: in a 5-4 decision, two of the conservative justices voted with the 3 liberal justices to preserve the Voting Rights Act. And the effects could be huge.
At stake in the case was the way that Alabama divides up its Congressional districts. Alabama has seven districts, one of which is what&#x27;s called a &quot;majority-minority district&quot; in which Black Americans are the majority of the population. In 2022, a group of Black voters sued the state, saying that under the law, Alabama should actually have two majority-minority districts. And the Supreme Court agreed.


The decision could affect recently redrawn district maps in other states, which could in turn affect the balance of power in the House of Representatives. You can read more about these gerrymandering cases at the Brennan Center for Justice: Allen v. Milligan: Gerrymandering at the Supreme Court (Formerly Merrill v. Milligan) and Redistricting Litigation Roundup.

                  <p>In roughly the time it took you to read this sentence, Max Park solved a Rubik&#x27;s Cube. With his time of 3.13 seconds, Park bested Yusheng Du&#x27;s 2018 mark of 3.47 seconds. Just watch the video above...it&#x27;s ridiculous. I love how the judge comes in to preserve the scene as everyone goes bananas.
Park was one of the subjects of the excellent documentary, The Speed Cubers (trailer).

                  <p>NASA keeps the original film negatives from the Apollo program sealed in a frozen vault in Houston, TX and rarely grants access to them. As a result, nearly all of the photos we see of those historic missions were made decades ago or are copies of copies. Recently, the film was cleaned and digitally scanned at &quot;an unprecedented resolution&quot;.
Using these new high-res scans, image specialist Andy Saunders remastered each of the 35,000 photographs, resulting in this incredible-looking book, Apollo Remastered: The Ultimate Photographic Record. From the book&#x27;s website:
The photographs from the lunar surface are as close as we can get to standing on the Moon ourselves, and for the first time, we were able to look back at Earth from afar, experiencing the &quot;overview effect&quot; — the cognitive shift that elicits an intense emotional experience upon seeing our home planet from space for the first time. The &quot;Blue Marble&quot; photograph, taken as Apollo 17 set course for the Moon, depicts the whole sunlit Earth, and is the most reproduced photograph of all time. Along with Apollo 8&#x27;s &quot;Earthrise,&quot; which depicts Earth above the lunar horizon, it was a catalyst for the environmental movement that continues today.


Saunders is also selling prints of some of these remastered photos, which look absolutely stunning.

                  <p>I was totally fascinated by this look at the absurd logistics of concert tours and now have a newfound appreciation for all the people involved who collaborate to make the magic happen (and perhaps also a little bit more forgiving about the high price of tickets (but Ticketmaster can still go to hell)).
Now, to an outsider, the load out process might look chaotic, and the pace of the tour may seem unsustainable or unmanageable. But though grueling and exhaustingly complicated, these massive, nation-wide tours function remarkably smoothly considering the variety of variables.

                  <p>After 14-year-old Preston Mutanga&#x27;s Lego version of the trailer for Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse (embedded above) went viral, the team hired him to animate a short Lego sequence for the actual film.
In the brief scene, we see a Lego version of Peter Parker as he observes a dimensional anomaly and sneaks off to the Daily Bugle&#x27;s bathroom to alert another Spider-Man about the issue. While the scene is short, it killed in my theater and it also looked as good as anything in the recent Lego films. After seeing it, a few friends of mine even commented that it must have been the same team that animated it. But nope! It was a lone teenager, actually.

                  <p>In 1979, just a few short years before she hit it big as a pop artist, Madonna was in a post-punk rock band called The Breakfast Club — she sang and played the drums. In the video above, the band rips through four demo songs in just over 8 minutes. From Dangerous Minds, some context:
Hardcore fans will also know Madonna has been known to perform versions of these songs (and other early material) live. Here&#x27;s the thing — much like the early days of the Go-Go&#x27;s, Madonna is definitely flexing her affinity for punk rock while mixing it with her own brand of spirited pop which the entire world would soon embrace and others would emulate. Now, if you&#x27;ve never heard this version of Madonna, and dig your punk with a side of pop, you are going to love these raw jams. It&#x27;s also quite compelling to hear them, knowing what was to come from Madonna in a few short years.

                  <p>The Atlas of the United States Printed for the Use of the Blind, published in 1837 before Braille was widely used, used embossed printing of lines, words, and symbols to be finger-readable.

Without a drop of ink in the book, the text and maps in this extraordinary atlas were embossed heavy paper with letters, lines, and symbols. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first atlas produced for the blind to read without the assistance of a sighted person. Braille was invented by 1825, but was not widely used until later. It represented letters well, but could not represent shapes and cartographic features.

                  <p>Icelandic filmmaker Jón Karl Helgason has made a film called Sundlaugasögur (Swimming Pool Stories) about the central role of the swimming pool in Icelandic life. The trailer is above. From Fatherly:
The swimming pool is first and foremost a communal space. &quot;The swimming pool is your second home,&quot; Helgason says. &quot;You are brought up in the swimming pool.&quot; There may be only 160, or so, swimming pools in the entire country (which is roughly 305 miles wide by 105 miles long), but every one of them is the essential social hub of a community, large or small.
The swimming pool is a public utility — as critical as the grocery store or the bank. &quot;The British go to the pub, the French go to the cafes — in our culture, you meet in the swimming pool,&quot; says Helgason. Swimmers come from all walks of life, from farmers to artists to clergymen to celebrities. &quot;You can have 10, 15, 20, 30 people [in the pool] — they&#x27;re talking about politics and about their lives.&quot;

                  <p>Astronomers believe that there&#x27;s a black hole at the center of almost every large galaxy in the universe. Some of those black holes are particularly energetic, chewing up the galaxies in which they reside and releasing massive amounts of energy out into the cosmos. Those black holes and the energy emitted from matter and gas falling towards their centers are what astronomers call quasars.
But if we look closely, we see who is actually in charge. Small as a grain of sand compared to the filaments, the centers of some of these galaxies shine with the power of a trillion stars, blasting out huge jets of matter, completely reshaping the cosmos around them. Quasars, the single most powerful objects in existence, so powerful that they can kill a galaxy.

                  <p>For the New Yorker, Louisa Thomas on major league pitcher Daniel Bard, who has struggled with the yips on and off during his career.
Many baseball players have minor control issues at one point or another. Sometimes it happens after an injury, when a player is relearning how to throw, over-attending to discrete motions that used to feel fluid and natural. &quot;Overthinking&quot; is the simple way to put it: the brain&#x27;s prefrontal cortex trips up the sensory cortex and the motor cortex. In other cases, the mind can essentially go blank. Players usually snap out of it, the way Bard had years before. But the brain can get stuck in certain patterns, and the yips can take over in a way that no one fully understands.

                  <p>Cutting to the chase: text editors *and* tabs vs. spaces!  Ooooh!


I&#x27;ve had this thing called &quot;e&quot; for a while now.  It&#x27;s a stupid little 
script which serves to do a couple of things.  It starts my 
editor
with a given file, and it kicks it with the right arguments to make it 
disable line wrapping and to make the [TAB] key actually put in two 
spaces.


So, my dumb script would use &quot;-w -E -T 2&quot; most of the time, except when it 
was running on a Makefile, at which point it would skip those args.  
Simple enough, right?


pico is back?  Yes indeed, on Macs, as of 12.3, pico is in fact back.  To 
make sure I wasn&#x27;t imagining things, I tracked down a machine that hadn&#x27;t 
been upgraded yet and checked there.  Sure enough, it was in fact nano and 
not pico.


macOS 12.3 has nano as a symlink... pointing to pico!


At some point, I switched from literal tab characters in my source code to 
blobs of spaces, probably due to using that style at work and not hating 
it.  So, somewhere along the line I actually started depending on nano 
behavior without realizing it.


As for the lack of a feature in pico itself, it&#x27;s kind of strange, really.  
If you go digging into the source, they have this random.c with a function 
called tab which claims to &quot;simulate tab stop&quot; using spaces.  That said, I 
can&#x27;t find any place where it would be called with the magic values which 
would make it behave that way.


It wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if this switch is just more of Apple removing 
GPLed things from their OS - pico seems to use the Apache license.  They 
dumped bash for zsh (MIT license) at some point (Big Sur, I think), and 
now this?  Okay then.</p>

                  <p>Here&#x27;s a very old and stupid trick you could do with some filesystems in 
some situations back in the day... and might still be able to do in a 
few places today.


The problem is that while version X might eventually have an exploit, 
it&#x27;ll get removed and it&#x27;ll be replaced by version Y without that
particular hole.  By the time you get your hands on a tool to break into 
X, it&#x27;ll be gone.


What you&#x27;d do is create a hard link pointing at the file you wanted to 
preserve, storing it in a spot which was writable by your account.  
Then, say, /usr/bin/sudo (because that never has security 
issues...) gets replaced at some point with a new file and you get to 
keep the old version.  When you get the tool to pop it, off you go!


Of course, these days, it&#x27;s not quite so easy on the more modern systems 
you find.  Debian 11 here won&#x27;t let me do it - it&#x27;s EPERM city.  Rocky 8 
(so CentOS 8 and RHEL 8 too) also won&#x27;t do it.  They both have some gunk
in /usr/lib/sysctl.d to lock this down.  But, my old Slackware 14.2 
install of my workstation let me do it the last time I tried about 
a year ago.  How about that, huh?  I bet it&#x27;d still work if I dug out 
the old drives and booted them up.


Incidentally, this is the magic sauce: /proc/sys/fs/protected_hardlinks
Read the man page for proc(5) to learn more about it.

here it is,
the thread I read a long time ago.  It&#x27;s interesting to note that as far 
as I can tell, nothing actually changed upstream.  This left paranoid 
admins like me with no option but to use the (most excellent) Openwall 
patches to lock down this kind of stuff.  I used that on my machines at 
work which had non-staff users... just in case.


This whole situation is scary.

                  <p>Back in January, you might have seen my
post
about a very large BBS which seemed to solve for the problem of &quot;how do 
we host a bunch of users&quot; by having one physical box per user.  It might 
have been one physical box per *two* users, maybe, but it&#x27;s hard to say.


Now, keep in mind digital cameras weren&#x27;t easy to come by, so I have 
very few actual pictures.  I&#x27;ll have to do a lot of explaining to make 
up for the lack of detail and alternate angles.  Clearly, I had no 
notion of ever using these pictures to tell stories 25+ years later.


Some friends at a local company had some bandwidth to spare (a T1 to 
Alternet somewhere, as I recall), so they parked a Zoom modem on one of 
their boxes and plugged it into a phone line.  We got an identical model 
to avoid cross-brand issues (Zoom m…</p>

save them in case conditions change or other things happen and make me

offices before the whole COVID lockdown thing happened and people 
largely stopped going to offices every day.  With that in mind, let&#x27;s 
proceed.

brought about this whole notion of &quot;microkitchens&quot;.  This is where 
they&#x27;d put their branding on the coolers (instead of &quot;Coca-Cola&quot; or

                  <p>One of the fun things I used to do at a prior job was to dig through the 
raw data points which were collected from the *many* servers we had.  I 
could just pick an interesting-sounding metric and then would just ask 
the system to show me the top 10 or bottom 10 out of a population of 
thousands or more.


To get my feet wet with the whole &quot;investigations&quot; thing that we&#x27;d do, I 
started looking into this one day and chose one of the many temp sensors 
which were being logged by the servers.  I forget exactly which one it 
was, for there were many.  The CPUs logged it, the chassis logged it, 
the power supply logged it, and so on.  There were so many choices.


I went looking for a reason.  What could possibly explain this?  First 
off, it didn&#x27;t line up with any obvious pattern in the host names.  The 
hosts were named for whichever team owned them, followed by a sequence 
number that was bumped any time a new one was provisioned.  There was no 
signal to be found in that.


There was more, though.  You could also see a &quot;rack position&quot; in this 
data, and now it started getting interesting.  It seems that all of the 
really hot machines had a rack position of something low, like 04 or 05, 
and never anything higher than that.  In fact, when looking at a whole 
rack, it was always the lowest number of all of the positions that were 
being used.  Now this was worth chasing!


It&#x27;s good that I asked, since they told me something surprising: 
position 04 or 05 or whatever was the *bottom* of the rack.  Yes, 
somehow, the lowest machine in the rack was the hottest!  They found 
this interesting, too, and wound up digging into it.  Given that I was 
far away in a distant office, this was the best way for us to proceed.


The problem was that the bottommost server would have nothing below it 
but just open space until it got to the floor.  That space would not 
move air efficiently, and it obviously mattered.


This rolled out and my hot spots disappeared.  Fantastic!</p>

wish I didn&#x27;t have to write about.

wrote
about seeing a maintenance truck rolling down the Caltrain line in 
Mountain View.  It had a special attachment to let it stay on the rails.  
At no point did the arms come down for the crossing.  It managed to 
approach, then the people inside looked around and went through, and the 
arms never budged.  There were no flashing lights or bells.




caught fire.  A bunch of people were hurt.  More were shaken 
up.


I&#x27;m assuming their construction trucks don&#x27;t trigger the &quot;short the 
rails together to signal various things&quot; logic, either.  This would 
mean that crossing arms stay up... and I have to assume it also means 
the signals along the way stay green instead of going red.

We will presumably hear more about whatever the signals said, and 
whether the train went past a red signal or not.  I just have a bad 
feeling that they saw a green and kept on going.</p>

                  <p>Here&#x27;s a little bit of Silicon Valley local flavor for a change.  We 
have this freeway that runs from San Jose to San Francisco called US 
101, or around here, just &quot;101&quot;.  (Southern California has it too, but 
they call it &quot;the&quot; 101.  That&#x27;s how we detect invaders.)  Anyway, this 
thing is usually eight or more lanes up and down the peninsula, and it&#x27;s 
had a &quot;diamond&quot; or car pool lane on the #1 (innermost/&quot;fast&quot;) lane for 
many years.  You had to have a certain number of people in the car (or 
some other conditions met) during certain hours (AM and PM rush, 
weekdays), or you&#x27;d be in for a hefty ticket.


How does the system know what to charge you?  Well, you either have an 
old-style toll transponder that always bills you as a solo driver, or 
you have a new-style transponder with a 1/2/3+ switch that tells the 
road how to handle you.


Think about what this does to enforcement.  Now, instead of just &quot;is 
there a vehicle in the lane&quot;, &quot;is it the right time during a weekday&quot;, 
and &quot;how many people are in the car&quot;, now it&#x27;s also a matter of &quot;do they 
have their transponder set properly&quot;.

they wanted to provide a service to other things running on the same 
Linux box.  But, instead of either writing Yet Another Service (tm) 
that would go through release processes and all of that good stuff, they 
went for a different design entirely.

                  <p>If a web site makes an RSS or Atom feed available, it&#x27;s not a bad idea 
to poll it from time to time.  Actually doing that poll like a good 
netizen (remember that concept?) takes a little attention to detail.


Given the reality of the situation, does it make sense to poll every 10 
seconds?  Probably not, right?  Someone set up something like that and 
left it running for a couple of months until I finally noticed it and 
dealt with it myself.


Given this, you can keep track of the &quot;Last-Modified&quot; header when you 
get a copy of the feed.  Then, you can turn around and use that same 
value in an &quot;If-Modified-Since&quot; header the next time you come to look 
for an update.  If nothing&#x27;s changed, the web server will notice it&#x27;s 
the same as what it already has, and it&#x27;ll send you a HTTP 304 co…</p>

                  <p>Here&#x27;s a concept: &quot;ssh to prod and edit directly on the machine&quot; is 
generally bad news.


I should point out that I didn&#x27;t know this person and had no idea how 
they would respond to such feedback - it might have been fine!  They 
might be a well-adjusted person who can take a request like that and not 
turn it around into a full-on nuclear attack.  But, I didn&#x27;t know either 
way.


At some point, I actually had a meeting with this developer for some 
other reason, and what happened was kind of amazing.  First thing, he 
brought it up and asked me about it.  I said something like, &quot;well, I 
didn&#x27;t want to get into it, but since you asked&quot;, and proceeded into 
something along the lines of &quot;obviously it would be best if you didn&#x27;t 
do that - sshing in and twiddling Python files on the actual production 
AWS instance of the service&quot;.


&quot;But... I suspect you are doing it for some reason?&quot;


My response was... I hope... reasonable: &quot;So as much as I would love to 
say &#x27;don&#x27;t do that!!!&#x27;, I&#x27;m not going to stand in the way of you 
literally doing your job.  So please proceed with care, and keep an eye 
open for some day when (first dumb thing) and (second dumb thing) aren&#x27;t 
problems any more and you need not do this any more.&quot;


It was either &quot;edit in prod&quot; or endure DAY LONG development cycles: make 
a change, wait 24 hours, come back tomorrow, and try it again.  That&#x27;s 
how broken it was.


The best part about this was that we had a totally reasonable 
conversation about it.  It&#x27;s the kind of thing which had become a rare 
commodity in those days at that place.


Would I expect someone else to go to that level of insanity every single 
time they just want to get their job done?  Absolutely not.

Editing files in prod to develop them?  That&#x27;s bad news.  Deliberately 
rigging tunnels to spoof a connection from prod?  That&#x27;s also bad news.  
Having to do them to get your job done?  You might be in the bad place.</p>

                  <p>Quite a while back, I wrote a post that basically went like this: if 
someone has a problem with someone else or something that person is 
doing, they&#x27;re going to find a way to get to &quot;no&quot;.  They will find some 
reason, some excuse, or some problem with it.  They&#x27;ll bring up a point 
and you&#x27;ll show that this is not in fact a thing.  They will then pivot 
again and again.


But, as I said, that was back then, and this time I&#x27;m talking about 
something else: when it happens in person with a coworker.  I had an 
experience like this a few years back, and figured I&#x27;d share how it goes 
for the sake of others who might not have encountered it yet, or who 
have and thought they were alone in this.

                  <p>This is a short one since it&#x27;s somewhere between a random bit of 
&quot;grab some popcorn&quot; amusement and a &quot;huh, that might be a problem some 
day&quot;.  In short, it looks like every Raspberry Pi filesystem installed 
from any given release image probably ends up with the same
UUID.


For instance, if you downloaded the &quot;lite&quot; version of Raspbian between 
roughly November 8th and January 28th, you probably got a file called 
2021-10-30-raspios-bullseye-armhf-lite.zip.  Inside, there&#x27;s an image, 
and the idea is that you dump that straight to your SD card, cram it in 
the Pi, and off you go.  The second partition on that image is an ext4 
filesystem which was created on some build machine somewhere.  The UUID 
on it never gets &quot;evolved&quot; to something else after the install.


You can see it inside the image itself here:


Or, if you actually installed a few of these things like I did over the 
past couple of months, you can just &#x27;tune2fs -l /dev/mmcblk0p2&#x27; and see 
the same value in there.


Don&#x27;t end up with a pile of SD cards on your desk and think &quot;I know, 
I&#x27;ll use the filesystem UUIDs to track which one goes where&quot;, in other 
words.


If it&#x27;s not breaking anything for you, it&#x27;s probably best to just let it 
be.  Untangling a boot mess on these weird little boxes is anything but 
fun.

Note: if you&#x27;re actually on a recent Raspberry Pi, odds are good that 
your /etc/fstab will be using *partition* UUIDs (PARTUUID&#x3D;...) and not 
those of the filesystem.  If in doubt, use blkid to see what&#x27;s what.</p>

                  <p>There are some interesting implications to the way that you have to 
handle references to other bits of code when you write a C++ header 
file.  There are things you can do which turn out to be suboptimal, and 
until or unless you work someplace with a coding style document or get 
some mentor who&#x27;s already been there, you&#x27;re likely to make some
mistakes.


Anyway, a common way to do this is to set up the outer class such that 
it has a pointer to the inner one.  You *could* have it just own it 
directly, but then that introduces problems.

Of course, bar.h probably has its own dependencies which get #included, 
and so now you end up with this evil web of slow compiles.  It sucks.

                  <p>Yesterday, I
put forth
a bunch of API possibilities for the problem of needing to return a 
value but also indicating the lack of a value and being able to comment 
on why.  In it, the notion of a &quot;wrapper&quot; around a string was presented, 
such that it might look like &quot;Result&quot;, and those brackets 
started looking like a pain.  There was also the possibility of having 
something like &quot;ResultString&quot;, but didn&#x27;t that open the door to having a 
bunch of code duplication?


After this had existed for a while, the general happy feeling of having 
this stuff in place became infectious.  I wanted it to cover other 
things with it, too.  I wanted it to handle something a bit more 
complicated than a mere string, and so decided to try my hand at the

                  <p>If you agree with the notion that you need to be able to tell the 
difference between the absence of a value and a value itself, then this 
has some impacts on the code you write.  If you want to keep &#x27;em 
separated (so they can come out and play), then it gets you looking at 
your API designs in certain ways.


Imagine we&#x27;re talking about a helper function that is intended to be run 
inside a program that&#x27;s handling the access to a web page.  It&#x27;s 
probably a CGI program, but it could also be buried inside some much 
bigger thing, too.  This is all about C++ styles, but you can probably 
see slices of other languages in here, too.

I mentioned taking my old Mac Mini out of the OS X/macos ecosystem and 
bringing it into Debian, and then what kind of hilarity followed when I 
attempted to install a Javascript linter (and it tried to drag in 180+ 
node-related packages).

                  <p>Oh dear.  The software fungus where bits of code take the
literal characters &quot;HTTP&quot; as a number
has expanded.  Now it has a variant: 4740180.


Where does this one come from?  
Go and gRPC, apparently!


I found this while searching the web for &quot;1213486160&quot; to see how things 
have been going in the past few years.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s still biting 
people all over the place.  There are far too many posts asking people 
to upgrade their software, or restart things, or do any number of 
useless rubber-chicken-waving techniques which ultimately will 
accomplish nothing.

When you see a funny-looking number, figure out where it comes from.
That&#x27;s the only way to have any chance of understanding what&#x27;s actually 
going on.</p>

                  <p>Yep, it&#x27;s time for another round of reader feedback.

&quot;process infection&quot; story:

https://lwn.net/Articles/883547/):


If you do privileged execution of specific operations via IPC you get 
the guarantee that whatever is done, is done from a well-defined, 
pristine execution environment, without leaking context implicitly. The 
IPC message is the *full* vulnerable surface, and that&#x27;s as minimal as 
it can get. And that&#x27;s great.




Oh wow, thank you for mentioning that, unnamed reader!  I definitely 
read that post on LWN at some point in the past couple of days when the 
pkexec thing started going around.  It must have really worked its way 
into my head, and then eventually stirred up the memory of everything 
getting &quot;nicely infected&quot; at $OLD_JOB.

                  <p>I once worked at a place that had an interesting little problem stemming 
from the way they managed machines and some of the fun side-effects 
processes can have on each other.  This is back in the pre-systemd days 
of running services, such that things tended to be started or restarted 
by someone or something that itself ran as root.  That is, if you 
started something, it might inherit one or more things from your 
environment.  Likewise, if you ran something with an unusual 
environment, it might bestow those &quot;gifts&quot; onto anything it happened to 
touch.


After locking themselves out of machines too many times, people 
generally learned that after you mess with a glibc upgrade, you restart 
the sshd listener on port 22.  Of course, they also had to learn to not 
whack EVERY sshd at the…</p>

                  <p>Nearly 30 years ago, I was given this picture.  I wanted to present it 
in a post all by itself to give it a chance to &quot;sink in&quot; before I went 
and used it in an analogy.  First, I&#x27;ll just show the image and explain 
what you&#x27;re looking at here.




I do remember the description from the back: this is a picture of *part 
of* something that was called the Software Creations BBS.  It was a 
multi-line bulletin board system where you could dial up and send 
messages to people, upload and download files, and (presumably) play 
online games (&quot;doors&quot;) and anything else they cared to offer.

64 machines in a little space.  I have to assume 
they are at least 
286s (ATs, more or 
less), but it&#x27;s impossible to tell from just this picture.  They could 
have been 386s or even 486s by that point, but …</p>

                  <p>Okay, so yesterday I 
posted
a picture of an old multi-line bulletin board system which had 
apparently taken over an entire bedroom with dozens of computers.  I 
mentioned that I intended to come back to the topic to throw in my own 
two cents, and so here we go.


Or, were you someone who found it horrific and wished there was a 
simpler way?  Did you wonder if it would be possible to pack all of that 
into one or maybe two boxes, instead?  Did you want a way to negate all 
of that complexity while still providing the same level of service?


Now, things are different.  I look at that and just sigh at the lost 
opportunities.  The actual amount of work being done on behalf of any of 
the users who are connected is tiny.  If we ignore the fact that the 
actual BBS software and related acc…</p>
