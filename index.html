                  <p>I 
wrote
the other day about how I went out and bought a second cell 
phone just because I wanted it to take the burden of all of the crap my 
new employer was about to throw at me.  I didn&#x27;t get into the reasoning 
behind this, or some of my experiences, and figured it&#x27;s probably worth 
some explanation.


This was far enough back in time to where we all still had desk 
phones, and assigned numbers that would ring in straight from the 
outside world, if you can believe it.  Mine never got any use, but it 
was definitely there for the first couple of years.


In those times, things were relatively simple.  The most mixing of work 
and personal stuff you could do was using your work laptop for other 
stuff.  I did this, and I know now that it was stupid, but I will now 
explain how it came …</p>

                  <p>I have a secondary phone which doesn&#x27;t get a whole lot of use.  I bought 
it a couple of years ago before starting a full time employee gig with 
the pink mustache factory.  I did this because my friends who were 
already there advised me that the company did not supply phones but did 
expect you to load a crapload of apps on to do your job.


It also meant that I could put it away at the end of the day and all 
work-related stuff would stay out of sight and out of mind until the 
next morning.


So, overall, I was surprised when it started being really belligerent 
about battery statuses.  I would find it at the end of the day somewhere 
down below 30% charge despite doing nothing but carrying it around in my 
purse all day.  Then, it would stay there at some low value for a very

                  <p>Hello! Recently I’ve been thinking about why I explain things the way I do. The
usual way I write is:
Try to learn a topic
Read a bunch of explanations that I find confusing
Eventually understand the topic
Write an explanation that makes sense to me, to help others
So why do I find all these explanations so confusing? I decided to try and find
out! I came up with a list of 12 patterns that make explanations hard for me to
understand. For each pattern I’ll also explain what I like to do instead to
avoid the issue.
these patterns are very normal
This list isn’t meant to make you feel bad about your writing. I’ve probably
done all of these things! I’m certainly going to do them again! I even did at
least one of them while writing this post!
But knowing that I’m likely to accidently do these t…</p>

                  <p>A while back, I bought and installed a dash camera on my car.  I figured 
after initially seeing tons of crazy Russian insurance scams thwarted by 
it, and then a bunch of crazy videos from the rest of the world, it was 
my turn.  Then, over the weekend, it finally paid off by capturing video 
of something awful that happened to me.


My assumption is that the Phoenix-Vegas traffic makes things really 
crappy, hence the added enforcement and whatnot.  I figured, okay, I&#x27;ll 
set the cruise control exactly at the 75 mph limit and just leave it 
there until I&#x27;m well past this area.  At least it&#x27;s going to be 
well-maintained, well-lit, and all of that, right?  Safety corridor?
Surely that means they also maintain it better, since they enforce much 
more strenuously?

                  <p>A phonebook.yl program in Yorlang

The language Yorlang began like many code projects, with a group of programmers contemplating a what-if.


One evening after work, i was scrolling through the messages in a group chat that i&#x27;m in and i read a message by someone talking about how cool it will be to have a programming language in yoruba that can process the command &quot;sope &#x27;hello world&#x27; &quot;. So, i thought it was cool and i decided to create a very small language.


With that modest intention in mind, Karounwi Anoulowapo (based in Nigeria) created Yorlang, a JS-like language using keywords drawn from Yoruba. As colleagues requested more features, he kept expanding it until it became a full-fledged language. Other Yoruba-speaking programmers contributed, along with some non-speakers who were excited about a programming language created by and for West Africans.


One of the major contributors to the projects is a guy from the Igbo tribe. He documented the architecture of the code, contributed helper functions to the language, and also made small sample programs using yorlang.

                  <p>There was a SEV review meeting once upon a time, and in it, we had 
reviewed some incident where something bad happened involving something 
that ran as root.  I don&#x27;t remember the finer points of that one any 
more, but the resident VP who ran the show wondered aloud how much 
&quot;root exposure&quot; we had in our infra in general.  That got my attention.


After the meeting ended without using the whole 90 minutes, the room was 
still reserved for another 15-20 minutes or so, and a couple of people 
hung out to look at the list.  One noticed that this one service 
running everywhere had these options for &quot;pre&quot; and &quot;post&quot; commands.  
This was a service which was normally used for performance measurement 
stuff and involved running an external command.  You&#x27;d say &quot;okay, 
analyze this thing for me&quot;…</p>

                  <p>For some reason Spotify has increasingly been pushing shows and podcasts as a thing I might want to listen to. I don&#x27;t. I&#x27;m happily paying for Spotify so I don&#x27;t have to listen to ads, so instead I seem to get them in the podcast form.
I asked Spotify&#x27;s support how to turn this off, and they said:

We&#x27;re afraid that it&#x27;s not currently possible to remove these recommendations. Rest assured, we&#x27;ll let the right folks know this is something you&#x27;d like to see soon.

So yeah… I won&#x27;t be holding my breath.
This to me, falls within the right to repair (which I really don&#x27;t understand or agree with the push back) - so I fixed it myself.</p>

                  <p>The day after my last entry on my tinnitus I was approved, or rather I was in an acceptable range of hearing, to qualify for the Lenire treatment. The equipment isn&#x27;t cheap but I&#x27;ve always justified the money spent on improving my health or mental health is always money worth spending. So I paid up the equipment was configured and shipped from Ireland on the Friday and I had my &quot;fitting&quot; appointment on the Wednesday. Then I was off.</p>

News
This month, Calcifer is being re-built. While we wait for that, we&#x27;re working on more projects aboard. We added insulation to the v-berth, an attempt to keep Pino warm this winter. We created a new portal called boat projects on our wiki that covers most of the major construction projects we&#x27;ve done to the boat.
Our friends at Compudanzas have started writing an Introduction to Uxn Programming tutorial. We recommend it to anyone interested in programming for the Uxn Computer. No prior understanding of stack-machines, or Assembly, required! The first covers basics, and the latest chapter focuses on learning to draw pixels on the screen.

A con-artist is just a gabby mugger, and when they vanish with your money, you know you&#x27;ve been robbed. A grifter, on the other hand, is someone who can work the law to declare your stuff to be their stuff, which makes you a lawless cur because your pockets are stuffed full of their money and merely handing it over is the least you can do to make up for your sin.

                  <p>We’ve been having conversations for thousands of years. Whether to convey information, conduct transactions, or simply to check in on one another, people have yammered away, chattering and gesticulating, through spoken conversation for countless generations. Only in the last few millennia have we begun to commit our conversations to writing, and only in the last few decades have we begun to outsource them to the computer, a machine that shows much more affinity for written correspondence than for the slangy vagaries of spoken language.
Computers have trouble because between spoken and written language, speech is more primordial. To have successful conversations with us, machines must grapple with the messiness of human speech: the disfluencies and pauses, the gestures and body language, an…</p>

The pandemic has pushed more people into boat and van living (to travel within their own countries) and towards simple systems. Looking at the Nature&#x27;s Head website, they&#x27;ve had a 8-week waiting list for ages. It&#x27;s either you wait for the thing, or you build the thing.

                  <p>The game went live just under a week ago and the feedback has been really nice to see.
There&#x27;s been a balance of &quot;regular&quot; players and power players, and in those power players is where the game got some more much needed play testing.
The one thing that I had designed into the game was the unlimited undo. The side effect was that, technically, there&#x27;s infinite ability to make your way through the game so long as you had time and patience - a lot of patience!
The knock on problem with infinite moves is that the score really isn&#x27;t infinite. In fact, I alluded to that in a previous devlog because the score is a 16bit value, it has a max range.
So with that, this new release adds a penalty to using the undo. I went through a lot of different ideas and tested them out to see how they affected the score. Here&#x27;s just a few that I tried:

Subtracting 100 points per undo
Halving the score per undo
Subtracting the number of blocks restored
Using the undo depth as a multiplier - as in: if you undo twice, the penalty is greater

These had either drastic effects on the score, which made it pointless, or very subtle effects which rendered the penalty ineffective.
What I settled on was using your progress as the multiplier. So, undo costs 25 points per undo on level 1. On level 2, it costs 50 points, level 3 75 points and so on.
This changes the dynamic of the game in a really interesting way. You start to consider the impact on your decisions against your score: do I continue with undo and risk it, or do I accept the fate of stable score and hope it&#x27;s good enough for a highscore?
There was also some fixes for the custom themes - around the palette because I require a custom palette for the game&#x27;s main tiles, but when you add your own custom tiles the game switches to the default Layer 2 palette - so there were fixes around that too. And here&#x27;s Gaz Mashall&#x27;s own custom theme in action behind a new user interface change:</p>

Flash, Photoshop, and responsive design
When I first started designing websites, my go-to software was Photoshop. I created a 960px canvas and set about creating a layout that I would later drop content in. The development phase was about attaining pixel-perfect accuracy using fixed widths, fixed heights, and absolute positioning.
Ethan Marcotte’s talk at An Event Apart and subsequent article “Responsive Web Design” in A List Apart in 2010 changed all this. I was sold on responsive design as soon as I heard about it, but I was also terrified. The pixel-perfect designs f…</p>

                  <p>If you make a language and are lucky, someone else will write code for it. If you are very lucky, someone else will find uses for it you never intended, or that even challenge the premise of the language.

This is not the same as using the language in an unexpected way. Urban Müller could not have foreseen brainfuck as the bedrock for a Rust-like language or a CPU. But do these projects truly counter brainfuck&#x27;s premise? I would argue not. Brainfuck appears chaotic but part of its appeal has always been in conquering that chaos, in building efficient algorithms using the language despite the challenge. These projects counter the chaos of brainfuck, but that really is the appeal of brainfuck in the first place, they are simply taking it much further than could have been anticipated. If Müller had wanted brainfuck to be impossible to master, he would have designed the language much differently.

Sometimes, however, a language inspires work that falls very far from the intent of its original designer. Most esolangs, like mainstream programming languages, are open systems and don&#x27;t dictate how programmers use them. C# offers many features to make structured code easy. But I can also write C# that looks like 80s BASIC wrapped in some standard C# boilerplate:

good examples. I haven’t seen a lot written about how to make examples, so
here’s a little bit about my approach to writing examples!
The basic idea here is to start with real code that you wrote and then remove
irrelevant details to make it into a self-contained example instead of coming
up with examples out of thin air.
I’ll talk about two kinds of examples: realistic examples and suprising
examples.
good examples are realistic
To see why examples should be realistic, let’s first talk about an unrealistic
example! Let’s say we’re trying to explain Python lambdas (which is just the
first concept I thought of). You could give this example, of using map and a
lambda to double a set of numbers.

                  <p>Ready for release.
After nearly ten months of tinkering in the evening, the Marbles Squared ZX Spectrum Next port is going live this weekend.
It&#x27;s not that it actually took 10 months to develop, it&#x27;s just along the way I learnt and wrote the code grid handling in assembly, and then I wrote an assembly based dot command that handles HTTP requests both getting and posting data to web servers - and this is now part of the official spectrum core code (which will ship in future machines) - so that&#x27;s a nice bonus.
I&#x27;m fairly confident there&#x27;s no lurking bugs, though I am trying to squash one non blocking issue where the game can&#x27;t get the high scores from the web (though oddly the game was able to post the high score for the player in question 🤔). Still, I think it&#x27;s looking pretty snazzy:

All the same, the itch download page is primed and ready for release on Saturday. There&#x27;s two downloads available: the game and the game with fully documented source code and PDF overview article.
In lieu of the release, I&#x27;ve been looking back at the original version I wrote in the early 2000s and found a web based Palm Pilot emulator that let me actually play and capture screenshots of the original game (I even managed to recover the source code and published it on github). So I present to you - the old version:

Once the game is live for the Spectrum I&#x27;ll release the web version and if I planned the code right, we&#x27;ll all be able to contribute to the high score leader board!</p>

A refreshing lesson in the history of the internet, primarily focused on the US (with a decent hat tip to Dame Wendy Hall) but really well written.
A recommendation by Jeremy Keith tipped this from my &quot;to read&quot; list into my brain and it was one of the easier non-fiction books I&#x27;ve read, purely down to Evens&#x27; writing style.
Highly recommend if you&#x27;re working on the web or interested in modern computing history.</p>

                  <p>Sometimes I need to pull a complete copy of a previous file out of a github (this is useful when needing to do visual binary diffs to see which bytes have moves or changed).
To pull a specific file, say the last commit, the following command line does the trick:
git show HEAD^:./myfile.bin &gt; myfile.bin

The HEAD^ means &quot;one commit behind the head of the branch&quot; (the &quot;head&quot; being the last commit on the branch). Though if you&#x27;ve got merge commits where a commit has more than one parent commit this can get a little complicated (which why I tend to stick to just the previous commit).
Using HEAD^^ or HEAD^2 means &quot;two commits before the head of the branch&quot;. There&#x27;s also detailed stackoverflow post about the difference between the caret ^ and the tilde ~ with examples of how they traverse up the tree.</p>

                  <p>“Any comment?” is probably one of the worst ways to ask for feedback. It’s vague and open ended, and it doesn’t provide any indication of what we’re looking for. Getting good feedback starts earlier than we might expect: it starts with the request. 
It might seem counterintuitive to start the process of receiving feedback with a question, but that makes sense if we realize that getting feedback can be thought of as a form of design research. In the same way that we wouldn’t do any research without the right questions to get the insights that we need, the best way to ask for feedback is also to craft sharp questions.
Design critique is not a one-shot process. Sure, any good feedback workflow continues until the project is finished, but this is particularly true for design because design wor…</p>

Today I’m angry and need to vent. Alternative title: Need to vent. Might delete later. Just days ago my Twitter timeline was blowing up with news of Near’s death. It’s a very difficult and heartbreaking story. I don’t really want to say much about this loss other than it is a tremendous loss. I’ll share the two tweets, but please look up this person’s contributions too. This post is not...</p>

Pino and crew spent the first half of the month in the boatyard. We splashed back into the water on the 14th and moved to North Saanich to have access to a workshop with the goal of completing our dry toilet. We are documenting the entire installation, with plans to update the page when we begin to use it. We are ALMOST done with this project.
We started working on Niju, a hiragana/katakana review application. We used this project to test our the latest iteration of Nasu so we could finalize the documentation.
On June 26 2021, Devine met up with the London SF reading group to talk about solarpunk, see their notes. On July 10th UTC 20:00, Devine will also perform with  Orca for flash crash.
See Uxn running on the ESP32. It is TOO adorable!

Here&#x27;s what I mean. West Virginia is known as coal country, but coal is actually a small, dwindling industry in WV; WV&#x27;s biggest industry is chemical processing, dominated by Dow – chem processing, like many industries, is heavily concentrated into a few global monopolies.

There&#x27;s some nice additions but the trick is to use them for local tooling and not for shared tools or workflows as it&#x27;s less likely someone else will have a tool like sd installed.
The dog and xh look particularly interesting to me.
