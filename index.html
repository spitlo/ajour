                  <p>Oh dear.  The software fungus where bits of code take the
literal characters &quot;HTTP&quot; as a number
has expanded.  Now it has a variant: 4740180.


Where does this one come from?  
Go and gRPC, apparently!


I found this while searching the web for &quot;1213486160&quot; to see how things 
have been going in the past few years.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s still biting 
people all over the place.  There are far too many posts asking people 
to upgrade their software, or restart things, or do any number of 
useless rubber-chicken-waving techniques which ultimately will 
accomplish nothing.

When you see a funny-looking number, figure out where it comes from.
That&#x27;s the only way to have any chance of understanding what&#x27;s actually 
going on.</p>

&quot;process infection&quot; story:

https://lwn.net/Articles/883547/):


If you do privileged execution of specific operations via IPC you get 
the guarantee that whatever is done, is done from a well-defined, 
pristine execution environment, without leaking context implicitly. The 
IPC message is the *full* vulnerable surface, and that&#x27;s as minimal as 
it can get. And that&#x27;s great.




Oh wow, thank you for mentioning that, unnamed reader!  I definitely 
read that post on LWN at some point in the past couple of days when the 
pkexec thing started going around.  It must have really worked its way 
into my head, and then eventually stirred up the memory of everything 
getting &quot;nicely infected&quot; at $OLD_JOB.

                  <p>I’m working on a zine about DNS right now, so I’ve been thinking about DNS
terminology a lot more than a normal person. Here’s something slightly
confusing I’ve noticed about DNS terminology!
Two of the most common DNS server terms (“nameserver” and “DNS resolver”)
have different meanings depending on the situation.
Now this isn’t a problem if you already understand how DNS works – I can
easily figure out what type of “nameserver” is being discussed based on
context.
But it can be a problem if you’re trying to learn how DNS works and you don’t
realize that those words might refer to different things depending on the
context – it’s confusing! So I’m going to explain the different possible
meanings and how to figure out which meaning is intended.

Leave the poles to the pros. And yes, it feels like we just put out the flames on the torch — less than six months ago to be exact. But […]

                  <p>Hello! I wrote a comic last week called “life of a DNS query” that explains how
DNS resolvers work.
In this post, I want to explain how DNS resolvers work in a different way –
with a short Go program that does the same thing described in the comic.
The main function (resolve) is actually just 20 lines, including comments.
I usually find it easier to understand things work when they come in the form
of programs that I can run and modify and poke at, so hopefully this program
will be helpful to some of you.
The program is here: https://github.com/jvns/tiny-resolver/blob/main/resolve.go

                  <p>I’ve been having a hard time understanding IPv6. On one hand, the basics initially seem pretty
straightforward (there aren’t enough IPv4 addresses for all the devices on the
internet, so people invented IPv6! There are enough IPv6 addresses for
everyone!)
But when I try to actually understand it, I run into a lot of questions. One
question is: twitter.com does not support IPv6. Presumably it can’t be causing
them THAT many issues to not support it. So why do websites support IPv6?
I asked people on Twitter why their servers support IPv6
and I got a lot of great answers, which I’ll summarize here. These all come
with the disclaimer that I have basically 0 experience with IPv6 so I can’t evaluate these reasons very well.
First though, I want to explain why it’s possible for twitter.com to no…</p>

                  <p>At the start of this year, after over 2½ years of growing my hair, I cut it all off, right to the scalp and donated it to charity, specifically so Little Princess Trust, a charity who create wigs for little girls with cancer. Whilst Julie also raised over £650 which pays for the creation.
I did post the progress on Twitter, but I don&#x27;t trust that site to be around in the next decade or two, so I&#x27;m posting it here too, since this site will be around as long as I am.</p>

in a post all by itself to give it a chance to &quot;sink in&quot; before I went 
and used it in an analogy.  First, I&#x27;ll just show the image and explain 
what you&#x27;re looking at here.




I do remember the description from the back: this is a picture of *part 
of* something that was called the Software Creations BBS.  It was a 
multi-line bulletin board system where you could dial up and send 
messages to people, upload and download files, and (presumably) play 
online games (&quot;doors&quot;) and anything else they cared to offer.

64 machines in a little space.  I have to assume 
they are at least 
286s (ATs, more or 
less), but it&#x27;s impossible to tell from just this picture.  They could 
have been 386s or even 486s by that point, but …</p>

                  <p>Okay, so yesterday I 
posted
a picture of an old multi-line bulletin board system which had 
apparently taken over an entire bedroom with dozens of computers.  I 
mentioned that I intended to come back to the topic to throw in my own 
two cents, and so here we go.


Or, were you someone who found it horrific and wished there was a 
simpler way?  Did you wonder if it would be possible to pack all of that 
into one or maybe two boxes, instead?  Did you want a way to negate all 
of that complexity while still providing the same level of service?


Now, things are different.  I look at that and just sigh at the lost 
opportunities.  The actual amount of work being done on behalf of any of 
the users who are connected is tiny.  If we ignore the fact that the 
actual BBS software and related acc…</p>

It’s fun to track it! update: i finished modeling a bunch of trees (enough for variety) and finally got the procedural forest running.it&#x27;s so cool and spooky!! i was right too. the god rays + trees are intense. the light effect is amazing too. i love this.can&#x27;t wait to get some good fog into this… https://t.co/E6OeK0h3Wz pic.twitter.com/DjqcVh9vcv — Nathalie Lawhead (@alienmelon) January...</p>

In this article, we explore stacking contexts, and see how they can thwart our efforts to use z-index. We&#x27;ll also learn how to use this mechanism to our advantage.</p>

                  <p>Hello! Recently I’ve been thinking about putting my static sites on servers
that I run myself instead of using managed services like Netlify or GitHub
Pages.
Originally I thought that running my own servers would require a lot of
maintenance and be a huge pain, but I was chatting with Wesley about what kind
of maintainance their servers require, and
they convinced me that it might not be that bad.
So I decided to try out moving all my static sites to a $5/month server to see
what it was like.
Everything in here is pretty standard but I wanted to write down what I did
anyway because there are a surprising number of decisions and I like to see
what choices other people make.

It exists – and is hundreds of years old. The hot water bottle could save a great deal of energy and money without sacrificing thermal comfort. Hot water bottles work both indoors and outdoors. Illustration: Marie Verdeil. A hot water bottle is a sealable container filled with hot water, often enclosed in a textile cover, which is directly placed against a part of the body for thermal comfort. The hot water bottle is still a common household item in some places – such as the UK and Japan – but it is largely forgotten or...</p>

                  <p>When I first learned about it, DNS didn’t seem like it should be THAT
complicated. Like, there are DNS records, they’re stored on a server, what’s
the big deal?
But with DNS, reading about how it works in a textbook doesn’t prepare you for
the sheer volume of different ways DNS can break your system in practice. It’s
not just caching problems!
So I asked people on Twitter for
example of DNS problems they’ve run into, especially DNS problems that didn’t
initially appear to be DNS problems. (the popular “it’s always DNS” meme)
I’m not going to discuss how to solve or avoid any of these problems in this
post, but I’ve linked to webpages discussing the problem where I could find
them.

In fact, I might have gone a bit too far, as I managed to stream full resolution video and even play games via WiFi. But see for yourself: Click the image to see the video on youtube.com. So, as usual, you have two alternatives to start here: Watch the video or read the article. If you are just curious and want to see what I did, definitely check out the video. If you want to understand exactly how it works and if you want to reproduce it or find tricks for your own projects, go for the article and the linked code. In any case, if you have not seen the previous article and/or video on the cartridge itself, you should start there.</p>

                  <p>Here’s a very quick “how to” post on how to find your domain’s authoritative
nameserver.
I’m writing this because if you made a DNS update and it didn’t work, there are 2 options:
Your authoritative nameserver doesn’t have the correct record
Your authoritative nameserver does have the correct record, but an old record is cached and you need to wait for the cache to expire
To be able to tell which one is happening (do you need to make a change, or do
you just need to wait?), you need to be able to find your domain’s
authoritative nameserver and query it to see what records it has.
But when I looked up “how to find a domain’s authoritative nameserver” to see
what advice was out there, I found a lot of different methods being mentioned,
some of which can give you the wrong answer.

                  <p>One of the things that makes DNS difficult to understand is that it’s
decentralized. There are thousands (maybe hundreds of thousands? I don’t know!) of authoritative nameservers, and at least
10 million resolvers.
And they’re running lots of different software! All these different servers
running software means that there’s a lot of inconsistency in how DNS works,
which can cause all kinds of frustrating problems.
But instead of talking about the problems, I’m interested in figuring out –
why is it a good thing that DNS is decentralized?
why is it good that DNS is decentralized?
One reason is scalability – the decentralized design of DNS makes it
easier to scale and more resilient to failures. I find it really amazing that
DNS is still scaling well even though it’s almost 40 years old. Th…</p>

                  <p>I guess I&#x27;ve turned into a collector of numbers that break things 
sometimes.  Here&#x27;s another one I just heard about, and it&#x27;s directly 
related to what just happened with the calendar.


The last value for last year is December 31, 2021 at 23:59, and in this 
format it becomes 2112312359.  That just fits into a signed 32 bit 
number (which tops out at 2147483647).


So, if you&#x27;re using Microsoft Exchange and stopped getting your mail in 
the past couple of hours, this is why!

Really!  No joke!

Happy 2022, everyone.</p>

                  <p>Well, it&#x27;s 2022 and everything is turning out exactly as I predicted back when I was 7. Self-driving cars, space stations, the internet.  Nailed it.
Favorite TV show of 2021 was Only Murders in the Building.  
Favorite game of 2021 was Loop Heroes. 
Favorite book of 2021 was Einstein&#x27;s Fridge.
Favorite rediscovered joy of 2021 was reading physical books.
Favorite movie of 2021 was Dune.
Favorite time waster of 2021 was watching physics videos on YouTube.
Least favorite movie of 2021 was anything with f**king superheroes.
Favorite pandemic of 2021 was Covid-19 (three years running).
See you in an exciting 2022 where everyone will be nice and respectful and personal agendas are put aside for the greater good and we all come together and save the planet. 
Either that or a horrific dystopian post-apocalyptic world where we hunt each other for food.
2022 could go either way.</p>

                  <p>As my year in reading goes, I&#x27;ve certainly read less books, but I&#x27;ve not spent less time reading. It&#x27;s just some books take me longer than others. For example, I read Call of the Wild, an 80(ish) page book in 4 weeks and then I read a 400 page book in 4 days… so it&#x27;s really swings and roundabouts.
I recorded 21 books on my Kindle this year, but actually one of them was read aloud to the kids (Which I do still count) but another one was all of 19 pages… which, I think really doesn&#x27;t count (it was Home: Habitat, Range, Niche, Territory by Martha Wells). So… 20 books then.
This post is mostly data driven (from my own web site&#x27;s data) to give me a sense of the quality of the books I&#x27;ve read, otherwise individual reviews are all linked in this post or available on my books page.</p>

                  <p>It’s the end of the year again! This was my second full year working for myself
on wizard zines.
Here are some thoughts about what I’m working towards, a bunch of things I made
this year, and a few ideas and questions about 2022.
made some progress on a “mission statement”
I think the two hardest things about working for myself are working alone and
having to decide what to do.
This year I spent some time trying to figure out what I’m doing with wizard
zines. This is hard for me because I work in a pretty intuitive way – I have
some feelings about what’s important, and even though following my feelings
usually turns out well, I can’t always explain what I’m trying to do.
Here are some thoughts about what I’m trying to do:

News
It is snowing, and we are cocooning. Our little woodstove is working hard. This month, we finally decided to release a paperback version of Busy Doing Nothing.
In our last update log, we mentioned that we were trying to grow Lion&#x27;s Mane mushroom, and we are happy to report that it was a success! It grew beautifully. Rek was so excited about the mushroom that they decided to draw some this month, this series focuses on varieties that grow on Vancouver Island.
In other news, we had an interview with the founder of Sourcehut, read it here. Also, our good friend Alderwick make us a very cool gift(YouTube).
Pino book club
We&#x27;re reading Fantômes: Issue 1, with work by 18 talented artists, put together by Lizbeth. It is a eerie, and gorgeous zine, we strongly recommend the Mike Wolf version.
Pino&#x27;s location: 48° 42.230&#x27;N, 123° 36.900&#x27;W

                  <p>~ This post is my epic roundup of recommendations for 202x! ~ When we talk about games, especially the indie game space, most of the games we suggest are ones with lots of critical acclaim, playtime, and that demand plenty of involvement. Playing a game these days feels like as much of a financial investment as it becomes a life investment. I find myself drawn more and more to spelunking itch.io for tiny hidden gems… getting lost while diving into all the developer pages filled with all these odd little works. Browsing itch or GameJolt has become almost as rewarding...</p>

                  <p>Lovely but I found the language almost too distracting.
Only right at the end of the book did I consider that maybe I really wasn&#x27;t the right audience for the story - as it seemed to smack of &quot;millennium type problems&quot;. Using air quotes in my description because I&#x27;m fairly sure this is a patronising statement I&#x27;m making!
The Dex character feels discontent with their achievements and is struggling to find fulfilling meaning. Their work has meaning to others but they&#x27;re left feeling empty. Obviously it&#x27;s an impossible measure as life trondles forward and achievements change with time.
For me it was only really when Dex meets the Robot (whose name I&#x27;ve already forgotten) when the book became more engaging. It was like the Dex character could be challenged and some real depth was offered (for better or worse for Dex&#x27;s personality).
But what I did struggle with was the language and the odd shoehorning of gender pronouns. Dex is neither &quot;he&quot; or &quot;she&quot;, so Chamber&#x27;s settles with using the &quot;they&quot; pronoun. This led to my own confusion regularly thinking the lines I was reading was referring to Dex and another character that was in the scene.
The sore-thumb moment is when Dex asks, interestingly, what pronoun the Robot uses, and the Robot responds with &quot;it&quot; and it refers to itself as an object. Dex replies with (something like) they are the same, and their pronoun is &quot;they&quot;. This seemed like a potentially interesting exchange between the Robot and Dex about the subject of how one refers to oneself and how they identify, but it doesn&#x27;t happen. It just has that exchange, and then the story returns to what they were doing and carries on. It felt jarring and like Chamber&#x27;s wanted to discuss this topic, but instead shoe horned it in.
I do also suspect that my trouble with the language is a me-thing and probably with practice it won&#x27;t cause me as much (or any) confusion, but for now, and this book, it definitely affected how I enjoyed the story.</p>

                  <p>That didn&#x27;t take long to fix and rebuild. I don&#x27;t know what is taking the city of Rome so long.

Start to finish, it took just over a year. I blame Limited Run Games.</p>

And then disaster stuck while moving it.

Most of the debris is still assembled large chucks, so it shouldn&#x27;t take long to fix.  I&#x27;m sure this happened to the real coliseum.</p>

                  <p>Several years back, I was doing my thing in a corporate environment, 
working on a project with some friends.  By virtue of being in a very 
large company, we had quite the assortment of libraries which could be 
brought in to do stuff.  Given that we had a &quot;would be nice&quot; item on our 
feature list that involved doing something with the filesystem, I went 
looking for a matching feature, and it turned into a security dumpster 
fire.  Here&#x27;s what happened.


When you&#x27;re in that situation, you can&#x27;t just mkdir() the final path.  
It won&#x27;t work.  You have to start from the top and work your way down.  
The ones which already exist will probably fail with -EEXIST, so 
sometimes it makes more sense to look at what&#x27;s there, work your way 
down, and then start the mkdir calls when you find that p…</p>

                  <p>Holiday repost!
Clayton and I did this back in Dec of 2004.  Interesting how much hasn&#x27;t changed. I&#x27;d have more &quot;male&quot; spouses now, something about loot crates and IAP, kissing up to steamers, and maybe change the last verse to be more &quot;indie&quot;, but its shockingly accurate years later.
The Twelve Days of Crunch Time
A poem by Gilbert and Kauzlaric
On the twelfth day of crunch time,
My project gave to me...

Twelve cents in royalties,

Eleven kiss-ass previews,

Ten nerdy testers,

Nine patent lawsuits,

Eight unplanned for features,

Seven frames a second,

Six angry spouses,

Five focus groups!

Four unstable hacks,

Three days without sleep,

Two surly artists,

and a crappy publishing deal.</p>

                  <p>I totally failed to guess the killer!
Poirot was staple TV viewing when I was a teenage so the image of the character is burned well into my consciousness (thank you David Suchet) - so reading an Agatha Christie book tends to come with very easy imagination and even accents for characters.
The story is well built, told in a way that makes me think I should have been able to deduce the killer myself (and something I&#x27;ve always wondered about murder mystery stories) and does a good job of flipping my expectations on its head!
Solid stuff.</p>

                  <p>I’ve been wanting to do another post talking about indie games, analyzing game design, and showcasing good examples from the indie space but… I’m struggling a lot with being afraid of unintentionally platforming an abuser. I know saying that out loud sounds irrational, maybe. It’s been hard finding love for a space that I feel like happily decided people like me are a justifiable loss if it means making snarky Twitter Takes about what they’re going through… or just benefiting from indifference. I don’t know anymore… I don’t want to rant. I want to talk about game design. It’s hard...</p>

                  <p>Hello, world!  A couple of days ago, I noticed someone remarking on a 
line from an older post of mine that had been making the rounds.  In it, 
I say something about adding a number to &quot;my list of magic numbers&quot;.  
That person wanted to see that list.


And so, I have put together this list of everything I can think of at 
the moment, along with a whole bunch of commentary that should be able 
to send you on dozens of romps through Wikipedia.  Hopefully this will 
both satisfy the request for &quot;the list&quot; and provide a lot of amusement 
on a day which normally is lacking in content.


Be safe out there, and enjoy.

and log4j somewhere in their lives are having a miserable time.  I 
figured I&#x27;d re-tell a story about terrible things done by way of a bunch 
of feature-rich libraries and dubious interconnections.  I&#x27;ve mentioned 
this in passing before, but this time I&#x27;ve tried to be much more 
specific about how it works.


Part 1: the flags.



DEFINE_bool(enable_foo, false, &quot;Enable the foo feature&quot;);
 
...
 
void my_func() {
  if (FLAGS_enable_foo) {
    do_something();
  }
}




DECLARE_bool(enable_foo);
 
...
 
void other_func() {
  // Turns out we need foo enabled to do our stuff.
  FLAGS_enable_foo &#x3D; true;
  // ...
}




int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  InitCompany(argc, argv);  // populates FLAGS_ of all kinds
  // ...
}
