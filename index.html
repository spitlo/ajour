                  </ul>
                  <p>Last November, I put up a
list
of a bunch of &quot;magic numbers&quot; including some years in which time/date 
stuff is likely to break.  There&#x27;s 2036 for the NTP era rollover, 2038 
for time_t requiring 32 bits in January *and* another GPS week rollover 
in November.


Looking at the current year gives you a hint.  It&#x27;s 2021, but another 
way of looking at that is that we&#x27;re 121 years past the year 1900.  A 
fair number of things use(d) 1900 as an epoch, base year, or just an 
offset of sorts.  Why?  Well, they were probably invented in simpler 
times when the current year wasn&#x27;t quite that far from 1900 at the time, 
and it would fit into fewer bits.  Specifically, it&#x27;ll fit into just 
seven bits... until 2028, that is.


So, if someone used 1900 as their base year, stored years relative to 
that, and then did it in just seven bits (or eight bits where one of 
them is a sign bit), it&#x27;ll overflow in a little over six years.  What 
happens then depends on which method was used, and whether it applies 
certain kinds of sanity checks.

1773.  Neat!


I originally spotted this thanks to a 
bug report type comment
on an epitaph (!) on HN.  That one is about ISO 9660 (CD/DVD stuff) 
software and how it handles years.

similar
was found in the Linux kernel in 2015 (and appears to have been 
patched).

reference to this same problem
that might be useful if you&#x27;re trying to keep your HP 3000 alive.  You 
know, the things with the 
300+ lb disk drives?  
(If you know, you know.)


Wikipedia does have 2028 in their epic
list
of time formatting and storage bugs, naturally, but it only talks about 
systems from the &#x27;70s.  It doesn&#x27;t mention ISO 9660 at all - at the 
moment, that is.  Perhaps someone in the know will update it and then 
this comment will be obsolete.


...


Eleven bits!  Luxury!  Ah, well, guess what happens in 2048?  Yep!


Finally, one random thing for anyone who&#x27;s not already aware: try
log2(n) to get a feel for how big a number is in binary.  Neat, right?</p>

noticed one common theme ‚Äì a lot of people have server issues (‚Äúmy server is
down! or it‚Äôs slow!‚Äú), but they can‚Äôt tell if the problem is caused by DNS or
not.
So here are a few tools I use to tell if a problem I‚Äôm having is caused by DNS,
as well as a few DNS debuggging stories from my life.
I don‚Äôt try to interpret browser error messages
First, let‚Äôs talk briefly about browser error messages. You might think that
your browser will tell you if the problem is DNS or not! And it could but
mine doesn‚Äôt seem to do so in any obvious way.
On my machine, if Firefox fails to resolve DNS for a site, it gives me the
error: Hmm. We‚Äôre having trouble finding that site. We can‚Äôt connect to the

Summary Of Changes
donsol, ported our Famicom(6502) code to Varvara(uxn).
uxn, wrote a reference guide and created a list of community projects.
noodle, added guides for the line and rectangle tool and updated shortcuts in the documentation.
grimgrains, optimized images and published a Chunky Apple Jam recipe.
100r, optimized images (see Rek&#x27;s notes). Added new pages: boom tent, grinder and small space.
left, optimized code.
nasu, fixed crashing bug with large selections.
News
This month, we found a used grain mill for Pino! Flour doesn&#x27;t keep as well as whole grains, so we decided to start milling flour (wheat berries, soy beans or chickpeas) only as we need it. We only released a Guide to Lacto-fermenting vegetables on grimgrains.
Donsol is now available as an uxn rom on itchio.
See Devine&#x27;s daily drawings series for October.
Pino book club
We&#x27;re continuing our readings of The Stories of Ray Bradbury by Ray Bradbury. Favorite shorts this month include The Long Rain, The City and Kaleidoscope.
Pino&#x27;s location: 48¬∞ 42.230&#x27;N, 123¬∞ 36.900&#x27;W

                  <p>In part 1 I explained how I took (mostly) off the shelf breakout boards and wired them up to talk to the Spectrum Next so I could use a MIDI controller attached to the PS/2 port (the external keyboard) to play music on the Spectrum Next&#x27;s DAW software: NextDAW.
However, I wanted to make it tidier and cheaper (to a potential user) which I alluded to at the end of the part 1 post.
I did just that, and produced 30 custom PCBs with a custom 3D printed housing which have all been sold and sent to people across the globe, including the UK, Germany, Sweden, Netherlands, Brazil and Japan.</p>

                  <p>My kind of silly.
I&#x27;d known the story for many years, but didn&#x27;t realise it was written in the 70s (or &quot;nearly 80s&quot;). My best knowledge of it was the movie with Martin Freeman in 2005 ‚Ä¶ which, didn&#x27;t quite live up to my expectation round the hype.
The book I found to be better (than the film - sorry purists - I know I shouldn&#x27;t compare!), though I couldn&#x27;t stop hearing Alan Rickman&#x27;s voice as Marvin.
I did sort of feel like nothing actually happened in the book. It was an adventure, but I think I missed the character arcs - or‚Ä¶ I wasn&#x27;t sure where to look!
Overall, good, funny and properly silly.</p>

                  </ul>
                  <p>Almost ten years ago,
I wrote an obscure post about something that would have only made sense 
if you also worked at Google at the time it happened (around 2010).  It 
was a reference to an Xtranormal video that someone created about the 
perils of trying to get your stuff running in production without having 
someone hate on you for &quot;doing it wrong&quot;.


When it came out, I took a screenshot of the long-suffering engineer 
(some kind of red panda/fox girl thing) and had a T-shirt made from it.  
I wore it to work a few times to great effect.  It was our own little 
internal joke within the company.


Ready?  
Here it is.


As for everything in the video, it is really close to what the reality 
of production was back in the day.  Things were actually quite a bit 
worse than what it suggests, if you can believe it.  The whole thing 
about &quot;get quota in two cells&quot; misses the fact that it was damn near 
impossible to get the quota you needed across multiple services 
(compute, storage, ...) in the same place at the same time.


So, if you heard stories about software engineers doing shady deals to 
trade quota between teams so they could get all of the stuff in the 
same spot?  Yep, this is where those came from.  That&#x27;s the kind of 
thing that was happening.  People had to blow time and energy on 
worrying about that kind of thing instead of working on whatever they 
were supposed to be doing.


I&#x27;m sure my non-solution probably bit someone later.  Sorry, whoever.</p>

                  </ul>
                  <p>A couple of weeks ago, I read a
post
about how the &quot;sealed system&quot; on Big Sur was hurting people.  I kind of 
skimmed through it and figured it was mostly complaining about the 
size of the download.  For whatever reason, that hadn&#x27;t been a problem 
for me and my machines, so I kind of wrote it off.


For a good number of years, I&#x27;ve been (foolishly, as it turns out) using 
the included Apache httpd to run small localhost-only stuff on my Mac 
laptop.  In recent times, I found that every upgrade of the OS would 
revert my httpd.conf and it would need to be put back.


Why would it matter if the sshd config got reverted?  Simple: it&#x27;s 
because the stock Mac sshd install includes password-based auth, and 
that means someone can brute-force their way onto your machine if they 
can connect to ‚Ä¶</p>

                  <p>If you&#x27;re riding the bleeding edge of Mac software updates, you might 
have just installed Monterey, or you will soon.  If you&#x27;re also running 
sshd so you can log in remotely, you should be aware that the typical 
&quot;revert your config&quot; shenanigans have happened, so you are
once again
accepting password authentication, and thus are subject to a brute-force 
attack.


Editing that file would likely get reverted upon the next patch 
(12.0.2?), so that&#x27;s right out.  You can&#x27;t go past it with a higher 
number, since as the sshd_config points out, the *first* instance of a 
setting is kept, and subsequent instances of the same setting are 
ignored.



UsePAM no
PasswordAuthentication no



Finally, after you make this change, make sure it actually worked by 
forcing a password/interactive-only login attempt to the machine.  Make

                  <p>I hadn&#x27;t realised that Medium had made JavaScript a requirement to be able to read any Medium post - I&#x27;d had JS disabled for ages on Medium just because of all the extra cruft they added.
But now, without JS, you only get the first few lines of content, and the rest is loaded entirely with JS - which‚Ä¶ is stupid.
Scribe fixes all that and focuses entirely on the author&#x27;s content.
I also used the FAQ to auto redirect and now I can read the full content without being distracted by Medium&#x27;s horrid cruft.
Great example of taking back the web.

You know a better understanding of user needs would help the team get clear on what you are actually trying to accomplish, but time and budget for research is tight. When it comes to asking for more direct contact with your users, you might feel like poor Oliver Twist, timidly asking, ‚ÄúPlease, sir, I want some more.‚Äù¬†
Here‚Äôs the trick. You need to get stakeholders themselves to identify high-risk assumptions and hidden complexity, so that they become just as motivated as you to get answers from users. Basically, you need to make them think it‚Ä¶</p>

                  <p>One of the fun things I used to do at a prior job was to dig through the 
raw data points which were collected from the *many* servers we had.  I 
could just pick an interesting-sounding metric and then would just ask 
the system to show me the top 10 or bottom 10 out of a population of 
thousands or more.


To get my feet wet with the whole &quot;investigations&quot; thing that we&#x27;d do, I 
started looking into this one day and chose one of the many temp sensors 
which were being logged by the servers.  I forget exactly which one it 
was, for there were many.  The CPUs logged it, the chassis logged it, 
the power supply logged it, and so on.  There were so many choices.


I went looking for a reason.  What could possibly explain this?  First 
off, it didn&#x27;t line up with any obvious pattern in the host names.  The 
hosts were named for whichever team owned them, followed by a sequence 
number that was bumped any time a new one was provisioned.  There was no 
signal to be found in that.


There was more, though.  You could also see a &quot;rack position&quot; in this 
data, and now it started getting interesting.  It seems that all of the 
really hot machines had a rack position of something low, like 04 or 05, 
and never anything higher than that.  In fact, when looking at a whole 
rack, it was always the lowest number of all of the positions that were 
being used.  Now this was worth chasing!


It&#x27;s good that I asked, since they told me something surprising: 
position 04 or 05 or whatever was the *bottom* of the rack.  Yes, 
somehow, the lowest machine in the rack was the hottest!  They found 
this interesting, too, and wound up digging into it.  Given that I was 
far away in a distant office, this was the best way for us to proceed.


The problem was that the bottommost server would have nothing below it 
but just open space until it got to the floor.  That space would not 
move air efficiently, and it obviously mattered.


This rolled out and my hot spots disappeared.  Fantastic!</p>

                  <p>I know I&#x27;ve already
commented
on a certain site&#x27;s big outage
twice now,
but I have one more bit of rumor to share, and it apparently invalidates 
what I had heard previously.  That is, it may not have been a matter of 
&quot;show X Y&quot; vs. &quot;clear X Y&quot;, but rather some kind of automation that went 
a bit too far.


Then, what if you didn&#x27;t have to actually type something in to hit the 
button?  Maybe you forgot, or something else happened, and you didn&#x27;t 
fill it in, so when you did that, it said &quot;okay, cool then&quot; and 
did all of them instead?


Go to tool, don&#x27;t type in target, hit button, ALL targets affected.


It sounds like another kind of &quot;footgun&quot; (you know, something you can 
use to shoot yourself in the foot) from the world of databases: an 
UPDATE without a WHERE.



UPDATE my_table SET invalid &#x3D; true WHERE asset_id &#x3D; 1012;



Imagine what happens when you forget the WHERE.  It&#x27;s the last thing on 
the line as shown, so you could send off the command early and it would 
totally work.  It would look like this:


And... guess what, without that WHERE, it just set that bit everywhere.  
Everything is marked invalid, and your business might suffer for it.


Final note on the &quot;do all the things&quot; thing: maybe the tool 
actually is supposed to let you do that.  In that case, maybe it would 
be good if it said something like &quot;you are about to drain 123,456 
devices, so type in that exact number to proceed&quot;.  You know,
that
kind of thing.  It tends to add enough of a pause to prevent some 
disasters.</p>

                  <p>Here&#x27;s something fun I saw which created an outage once.  I&#x27;ve written 
about this
before,
but in light of yesterday&#x27;s fun and games, I figured this one is worth 
another mention.


One way to do this on a Linux box with the usual GNU userspace stuff is 
to feed it to date, like this:


The problem is, there&#x27;s another command very much like it that will even 
spit out the same output, only it has a nice little side-effect: it 
also sets the clock.  That command is date -s.


Another problem is that you might not have known that -s has that 
effect, and you have been using it because it gives you the output you 
want, and you don&#x27;t realize what else it can do.


This then touched off a whole bunch of badness which I already talked 
about before.  It messed up other systems, and brought up questions of 
how to defend against it, and all of that other good stuff you&#x27;d expect 
to hear after a problem of that sort.

display everything, but instead it 
cleared everything.


show mpls lsp


clear mpls lsp


Hopefully the similarity to &#x27;date -d&#x27; vs. &#x27;date -s&#x27; is clear.

Small commands can have giant consequences.</p>

                  <p>Yesterday there was a big Facebook outage caused by BGP. I‚Äôve been vaguely
interested in learning more about BGP for a long time, so I was reading a
couple of articles.
I got frustrated because none of the articles showed me how I could actually
look up information related to BGP on my computer, so I wrote a tweet asking for tools.
I got a bunch of useful replies as always, so this blog post shows some tools
you can use to look up BGP information. There might be an above average number
of things wrong in this post because I don‚Äôt understand BGP that well.
I can‚Äôt publish BGP routes
One of the reasons I‚Äôve never learned much about BGP is ‚Äì as far as I know, I don‚Äôt have access to publish BGP routes on the internet.

                  <p>I spent some time in Reeder app this morning, catching up with RSS and the latest articles published by my favorite blogs.
I was reading Scott O‚ÄôHara‚Äôs article about using JavaScript to detect high contrast and dark modes, which includes a small, very useful script to do exactly what the title says. The output of that script at first looked like it was a ‚Äúfalse positive‚Äù. But some further investigation led me to learn something new about the prefers-color-scheme CSS user query.

Scott‚Äôs article includes a Codepen to demonstrate the output of the script. The script will check and detect if you currently have high contrast mode or dark mode enabled, and will output the result of the check.
See the Pen

FB critics say that the company&#x27;s machine learning and data-gathering slides disinformation past users&#x27; critical faculties, poisoning their minds. Meanwhile, Facebook itself tells advertisers that it can use data and machine learning to slide past users&#x27; critical faculties, convincing them to buy stuff.

                  <p>I got really bored tonight and went down some rabbit holes and turned up 
something from about a year ago.  If you follow the latest Linux type 
stuff, you probably remember this, but if not, this might seem new to 
you.  It&#x27;s just something dumb and amusing.


Go grab a Linux box with glibc on it.  Then compile and run this C code:


Then run it and watch what happens.  If you have multiple machines, try 
it on some of them and compare the results.  If the results are 
different, why do you suppose that is?


Neat, right?  It makes me want to go looking for places where people are 
calling these functions with ints that I can control to see if I can 
blow it up.

to see how the sausage is made by someone who did the work already.


...


This is awesome because it&#x27;s that many more possibilities.  I had been 
grepping source for &quot;isalnum&quot; to try to find inputs I can control, but 
now I realize that FAR more functions give a way into this.  Have fun!</p>

                  <p>On a rainy summer day, we pulled into Silva bay on Gabriola Island and found a place at a dock to wait out a spell of bad weather. The power receptacle appeared fine, but once we were ready to leave we found the male connection of our shore power cord had melted. Two out of three prongs were stuck in the receptacle. We&#x27;ve never had issues with our cord before, and for now we assume that the marina shore connection was faulty. Either way, we had to repair the power cord.
We always prefer to repair than to replace, so when we returned to a place with a marine store, we got ourselves replacements connections, both male and female, to replace the two damaged ends.
We thought we&#x27;d document the process of fixing a shower power cord. Although, this is only specific to Marinco marine fittings.

have an nginx playground website where you can just paste in an nginx config
and test it out. And then I realized it might actually be pretty easy to build,
so got excited and started coding and I built it. It‚Äôs at
https://nginx-playground.wizardzines.com.
Here‚Äôs a screenshot:

For the rest of the post I‚Äôm mostly going to talk about how I built the
project, because there were a few decisions that weren‚Äôt obvious to me.
how to use it
You need to enter both an nginx config and a curl or http command to make a
HTTP request to that nginx instance
And then you click ‚ÄúRun‚Äù in the top right, and it‚Äôll output either:
the results of the command you executed (if nginx started successfully), or

But how do you set up a content management system (CMS) to reach your audience now and in the future? I learned the hard way that creating a content model‚Äîa definition of content types, attributes, and relationships that let people and systems understand content‚Äîwith my more familiar design-system thinking would capsize my customer‚Äôs omnichannel content strategy.

make it really &quot;land&quot; when someone else does a web search.


On a Wednesday night not so long ago, someone opened a SEV (that is, a 
notification of something going wrong) and said the individual tasks for 
their service were &quot;crash looping&quot;.  These things ran in an environment 
where they were supervised by the job runner, so if they died, they&#x27;d be 
restarted, but you never wanted to keep it in this kind of state.


It looked like this had started when some update had rolled out.  That 
is, prior to the update, their service was fine.  After they changed

                  <p>In 2008, Mark Changizi, a Sloan-Swartz Fellow in Theoretical Neuroscience at Caltech, noted that the eye can make sense of complex relationships that often mystify the brain. 


Our everyday visual perceptions rely upon unfathomably complex computations carried out by tens of billions of neurons across over half our cortex. In spite of this, it does not ‚Äúfeel‚Äù like work to see. Our cognitive powers are, in stark contrast, ‚Äúslow and painful,‚Äù and we have great trouble with embarrassingly simple logic tasks.¬†

Might it be possible to harness our visual computational powers for other tasks, perhaps for tasks cognition finds difficult?¬†


In other words, could we trick the eye into performing computation?¬†

Changizi proposed the Escher Circuit, &quot;a special kind of image that amounts to &#x27;visual software&#x27; our &#x27;visual hardware&#x27; computes&quot; merely through perception.

Escher Circuits work by creating different states corresponding to how the eye resolves ambiguous images. Its core component, the wire, holds a state of 0 when we perceive it as if we are to the right of it; otherwise, it holds a state of 1.

                  <p>I have an older iPhone that used to be my daily driver.  It mostly just 
hangs around for testing random junk.  It&#x27;s still getting updates, and 
so when Apple offered it iOS 15 today, I installed it.  This gave me a 
chance to turn on their beta &quot;private relay&quot; stuff which seems to be 
a TOR-like system.


What did surprise me is the lack of &quot;stickiness&quot; for these IP addresses.  
Every five seconds or so, it seems to hop to another address in the same 
(IPv6, remember) /64.  If you&#x27;re not down with v6 conventions yet, this 
means the first four parts like &quot;xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx&quot; stay the same, but 
the last four change completely every time.


I actually don&#x27;t have any v4-only (aka LEGACY) stuff to try it on, so I 
have no idea what happens on that side of the world.  It probably looks 
about the same, albeit within a much smaller range of possible source IP 
addresses.  It probably resembles a CGNAT type situation.

It&#x27;ll be fun to see what this breaks, and who howls the loudest.</p>

is another one in the ‚Äújulia attempts to articulate her teaching strategy‚Äù
series.
I‚Äôll start out by talking about a ‚Äúbackwards‚Äù approach to learning
that I think a lot of you will recognize (do projects first without fully
understanding what you‚Äôre doing, fill in missing knowledge after), and then
talk about I try to teach in a way that works better with that mode of
learning.
how I‚Äôve learned programming: backwards
There are a lot of ‚Äúbasic‚Äù concepts in programming, like memory management,
networking, operating systems, assembly, etc. You could imagine that you learn
programming by first starting with the basic concepts and then learning
abstractions on top of those concepts.
But, even though I have a very traditional CS backgrou‚Ä¶</p>

                  <p>I&#x27;ve been struggling to get my head around voltage and amps - specifically after I bought a device that wanted 5V and 2A supply, but I was only giving it 1.6A I found the machine would fail (and reboot). The lack of amperage meant it wasn&#x27;t able to supply the entire board.
Just the image from this post was enough to make it click in my head üëç


VOLTAGE is like the pressure that pushes water through the hose. It is measured in volts (V).


CURRENT is like the diameter of the hose. The wider it is, the more water will flow through. It is measured in amps (I or A).


RESISTANCE is like sand in the hose that slows down the water flow. It is measured in ohms (R or Œ©).

                  <p>Hello! I was talking to a Python programmer friend yesterday about debugging,
and I mentioned that I really like debugging using a REPL. He said he‚Äôd never
tried it and that it sounded fun, so I thought I‚Äôd write a quick post about it.
This debugging method doesn‚Äôt work in a lot of languages, but it does work in
Python and Ruby and kiiiiiind of in C (via gdb).
what‚Äôs a REPL?
REPL stands for ‚Äúread eval print loop‚Äù. A REPL is a program that:
reads some input from you like print(f&quot;2 + 2 &#x3D; {2+2}&quot;) (read)
evaluates the input (eval)
print out the result (print)
and then goes back to step 1 (loop)
Here‚Äôs an example of me using the IPython REPL to run a print statement. (also
it demonstrates f-strings, my favourite Python 3 feature)

                  <p>There‚Äôs been a recent discussion on Twitter about the idea of adding a new element in HTML that represents a search interface. A search form, basically.
The idea is to create a semantic HTML element for the ARIA search role, which represents a landmark region ‚Äúthat contains a collection of items and objects that, as a whole, combine to create a search facility.‚Äù
Opinions have been shared in the Twitter thread about whether adding a new HTML element is necessary. Many have argued that it was unnecessary because we can use the ARIA search role and repurpose a form element to create the same semantics. I disagree. And this article is the longer version of my personal opinion on the subject.

                  <p>Hello! I was talking to a friend yesterday who was studying for a programming
interview and trying to learn some algorithms basics.
The topic of quadratic-time vs linear-time algorithms came up, I thought this
would be fun to write about here because avoiding quadratic-time algorithms
isn‚Äôt just important in interviews ‚Äì it‚Äôs sometimes good to know about in real
life too! I‚Äôll explain what a ‚Äúquadratic-time algorithm is‚Äù in a minute :)
here are the 3 things we‚Äôll talk about:
quadratic time functions are WAY WAY WAY slower than linear time functions
sometimes you can make a quadratic algorithm into a linear algorithm by using a hashmap
this is because hashmaps lookups are very fast (instant!)
I‚Äôm going to try to keep the math jargon to a minimum and focus on real code
examples and how fast/‚Ä¶</p>

                  <p>After developing the .http tool for the Spectrum Next in assembly, for my own workflow I did most of the testing against an emulator (before moving to hardware), however there&#x27;s some quirks with Cspect and the wifi/esp/internet setup, and since I&#x27;ve been through the fire and come out the other side it makes sense to write it up.</p>

                  <p>When using the Edge DevTools for VS Code extension inside the editor, one thing that I kept doing wrong was opening files accidentally next to the tools.

                  <p>This last GDC I was invited to participate in the Indie Soapbox. It‚Äôs a wonderful set of talks that happens every GDC in which each speaker is given five minutes to talk about anything they want. I talked about desktop pets, desktop toys, and why that entire concept is such a valuable mode of expression. I actually plan on writing a much longer, and more in-depth post about this (it might end up being a longer talk too), as soon as I have time‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs a topic that has really grown on me because I think it offers so much...</p>
