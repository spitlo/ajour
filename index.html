                  <p>A couple of weeks ago, I read a
post
about how the &quot;sealed system&quot; on Big Sur was hurting people.  I kind of 
skimmed through it and figured it was mostly complaining about the 
size of the download.  For whatever reason, that hadn&#x27;t been a problem 
for me and my machines, so I kind of wrote it off.


For a good number of years, I&#x27;ve been (foolishly, as it turns out) using 
the included Apache httpd to run small localhost-only stuff on my Mac 
laptop.  In recent times, I found that every upgrade of the OS would 
revert my httpd.conf and it would need to be put back.


Why would it matter if the sshd config got reverted?  Simple: it&#x27;s 
because the stock Mac sshd install includes password-based auth, and 
that means someone can brute-force their way onto your machine if they 
can connect to …</p>

                  </ul>
                  <p>If you&#x27;re riding the bleeding edge of Mac software updates, you might 
have just installed Monterey, or you will soon.  If you&#x27;re also running 
sshd so you can log in remotely, you should be aware that the typical 
&quot;revert your config&quot; shenanigans have happened, so you are
once again
accepting password authentication, and thus are subject to a brute-force 
attack.


Editing that file would likely get reverted upon the next patch 
(12.0.2?), so that&#x27;s right out.  You can&#x27;t go past it with a higher 
number, since as the sshd_config points out, the *first* instance of a 
setting is kept, and subsequent instances of the same setting are 
ignored.



UsePAM no
PasswordAuthentication no



Finally, after you make this change, make sure it actually worked by 
forcing a password/interactive-only login attempt to the machine.  Make 
sure it fails and doesn&#x27;t ask you for a password.  If you don&#x27;t know how 
to do this, the
previous post
contains info on that, including a terrible scanner script that belongs 
in the bottom of a cat box.

Enjoy.</p>

                  <p>I hadn&#x27;t realised that Medium had made JavaScript a requirement to be able to read any Medium post - I&#x27;d had JS disabled for ages on Medium just because of all the extra cruft they added.
But now, without JS, you only get the first few lines of content, and the rest is loaded entirely with JS - which… is stupid.
Scribe fixes all that and focuses entirely on the author&#x27;s content.
I also used the FAQ to auto redirect and now I can read the full content without being distracted by Medium&#x27;s horrid cruft.
Great example of taking back the web.

                  <p>Do you find yourself designing screens with only a vague idea of how the things on the screen relate to the things elsewhere in the system? Do you leave stakeholder meetings with unclear directives that often seem to contradict previous conversations? You know a better understanding of user needs would help the team get clear on what you are actually trying to accomplish, but time and budget for research is tight. When it comes to asking for more direct contact with your users, you might feel like poor Oliver Twist, timidly asking, “Please, sir, I want some more.” 
Here’s the trick. You need to get stakeholders themselves to identify high-risk assumptions and hidden complexity, so that they become just as motivated as you to get answers from users. Basically, you need to make them think it…</p>

                  <p>5 years ago I wrote a post called how to ask good questions.
I still really like that post, but it’s missing a few of the tactics I use to
get useful answers like “interrupt people when they’re going off on an
irrelevant tangent”.
what can go wrong when asking questions
Often when I ask a vague or underspecified question, what happens is one of:
the person starts by explaining a bunch of stuff I already know
the person explains some things which I don’t know, but which I don’t think
are relevant to my problem
the person starts giving a relevant explanation, but using terminology that
I don’t understand, so I still end up being confused
None of these give me the answer to my question and this can be quite

This talk goes over why uniqueness matters in a space like indie games. I discuss early internet and computer history, and why that history is something we can learn from to maintain the health and openness of the current “golden age” of the indie game space.

                  <p>One of the fun things I used to do at a prior job was to dig through the 
raw data points which were collected from the *many* servers we had.  I 
could just pick an interesting-sounding metric and then would just ask 
the system to show me the top 10 or bottom 10 out of a population of 
thousands or more.


To get my feet wet with the whole &quot;investigations&quot; thing that we&#x27;d do, I 
started looking into this one day and chose one of the many temp sensors 
which were being logged by the servers.  I forget exactly which one it 
was, for there were many.  The CPUs logged it, the chassis logged it, 
the power supply logged it, and so on.  There were so many choices.


I went looking for a reason.  What could possibly explain this?  First 
off, it didn&#x27;t line up with any obvious pattern in the host names.  The 
hosts were named for whichever team owned them, followed by a sequence 
number that was bumped any time a new one was provisioned.  There was no 
signal to be found in that.


There was more, though.  You could also see a &quot;rack position&quot; in this 
data, and now it started getting interesting.  It seems that all of the 
really hot machines had a rack position of something low, like 04 or 05, 
and never anything higher than that.  In fact, when looking at a whole 
rack, it was always the lowest number of all of the positions that were 
being used.  Now this was worth chasing!


It&#x27;s good that I asked, since they told me something surprising: 
position 04 or 05 or whatever was the *bottom* of the rack.  Yes, 
somehow, the lowest machine in the rack was the hottest!  They found 
this interesting, too, and wound up digging into it.  Given that I was 
far away in a distant office, this was the best way for us to proceed.


The problem was that the bottommost server would have nothing below it 
but just open space until it got to the floor.  That space would not 
move air efficiently, and it obviously mattered.


This rolled out and my hot spots disappeared.  Fantastic!</p>

                  <p>I know I&#x27;ve already
commented
on a certain site&#x27;s big outage
twice now,
but I have one more bit of rumor to share, and it apparently invalidates 
what I had heard previously.  That is, it may not have been a matter of 
&quot;show X Y&quot; vs. &quot;clear X Y&quot;, but rather some kind of automation that went 
a bit too far.


Then, what if you didn&#x27;t have to actually type something in to hit the 
button?  Maybe you forgot, or something else happened, and you didn&#x27;t 
fill it in, so when you did that, it said &quot;okay, cool then&quot; and 
did all of them instead?


Go to tool, don&#x27;t type in target, hit button, ALL targets affected.


It sounds like another kind of &quot;footgun&quot; (you know, something you can 
use to shoot yourself in the foot) from the world of databases: an 
UPDATE without a WHERE.



UPDATE my_table SET invalid &#x3D; true WHERE asset_id &#x3D; 1012;



Imagine what happens when you forget the WHERE.  It&#x27;s the last thing on 
the line as shown, so you could send off the command early and it would 
totally work.  It would look like this:


And... guess what, without that WHERE, it just set that bit everywhere.  
Everything is marked invalid, and your business might suffer for it.


Final note on the &quot;do all the things&quot; thing: maybe the tool 
actually is supposed to let you do that.  In that case, maybe it would 
be good if it said something like &quot;you are about to drain 123,456 
devices, so type in that exact number to proceed&quot;.  You know,
that
kind of thing.  It tends to add enough of a pause to prevent some 
disasters.</p>

                  <p>Here&#x27;s something fun I saw which created an outage once.  I&#x27;ve written 
about this
before,
but in light of yesterday&#x27;s fun and games, I figured this one is worth 
another mention.


One way to do this on a Linux box with the usual GNU userspace stuff is 
to feed it to date, like this:


The problem is, there&#x27;s another command very much like it that will even 
spit out the same output, only it has a nice little side-effect: it 
also sets the clock.  That command is date -s.


Another problem is that you might not have known that -s has that 
effect, and you have been using it because it gives you the output you 
want, and you don&#x27;t realize what else it can do.


This then touched off a whole bunch of badness which I already talked 
about before.  It messed up other systems, and brought up questions of 
how to defend against it, and all of that other good stuff you&#x27;d expect 
to hear after a problem of that sort.

display everything, but instead it 
cleared everything.


show mpls lsp


clear mpls lsp


Hopefully the similarity to &#x27;date -d&#x27; vs. &#x27;date -s&#x27; is clear.

Small commands can have giant consequences.</p>

                  <p>Yesterday there was a big Facebook outage caused by BGP. I’ve been vaguely
interested in learning more about BGP for a long time, so I was reading a
couple of articles.
I got frustrated because none of the articles showed me how I could actually
look up information related to BGP on my computer, so I wrote a tweet asking for tools.
I got a bunch of useful replies as always, so this blog post shows some tools
you can use to look up BGP information. There might be an above average number
of things wrong in this post because I don’t understand BGP that well.
I can’t publish BGP routes
One of the reasons I’ve never learned much about BGP is – as far as I know, I don’t have access to publish BGP routes on the internet.
With most networking protocols, you can pretty trivially get access to

                  <p>I spent some time in Reeder app this morning, catching up with RSS and the latest articles published by my favorite blogs.
I was reading Scott O’Hara’s article about using JavaScript to detect high contrast and dark modes, which includes a small, very useful script to do exactly what the title says. The output of that script at first looked like it was a “false positive”. But some further investigation led me to learn something new about the prefers-color-scheme CSS user query.

Scott’s article includes a Codepen to demonstrate the output of the script. The script will check and detect if you currently have high contrast mode or dark mode enabled, and will output the result of the check.

But anyone who&#x27;s ever borrowed because they were poor and needed money has learned the hard way that APRs are pure fiction. To get the true APR (what economists politely call the &quot;effective&quot; APR) you have to factor in the fees, penalties and other gotchas that turn reasonable seeming interest rates into perennial, inescapable debt-traps.

coming soon”. “Soon” has arrived! You can get any zine you want in print now!
I’m doing this now so that you can get zines in the mail in time for Christmas, or
any other end-of-year holiday you celebrate :)
you can preorder zines today!
First the basic facts!
you can preorder zines as of today
the preorder deadline is October 12
zines will ship around November 5
you’ll get them in time for Christmas
more logistical details in the Preorders FAQ
Here’s the link to get them:
Preorder print zines





Here are a few more notes about how the print zines work – they’re mostly the same as last time
why a preorder?
It makes it easier to decide how many zines to print! I don’t want to

FB critics say that the company&#x27;s machine learning and data-gathering slides disinformation past users&#x27; critical faculties, poisoning their minds. Meanwhile, Facebook itself tells advertisers that it can use data and machine learning to slide past users&#x27; critical faculties, convincing them to buy stuff.

                  <p>I got really bored tonight and went down some rabbit holes and turned up 
something from about a year ago.  If you follow the latest Linux type 
stuff, you probably remember this, but if not, this might seem new to 
you.  It&#x27;s just something dumb and amusing.


Go grab a Linux box with glibc on it.  Then compile and run this C code:


Then run it and watch what happens.  If you have multiple machines, try 
it on some of them and compare the results.  If the results are 
different, why do you suppose that is?


Neat, right?  It makes me want to go looking for places where people are 
calling these functions with ints that I can control to see if I can 
blow it up.

source
to see how the sausage is made by someone who did the work already.


...


This is awesome because it&#x27;s that many more possibilities.  I had been 
grepping source for &quot;isalnum&quot; to try to find inputs I can control, but 
now I realize that FAR more functions give a way into this.  Have fun!</p>

                  <p>On a rainy summer day, we pulled into Silva bay on Gabriola Island and found a place at a dock to wait out a spell of bad weather. The power receptacle appeared fine, but once we were ready to leave we found the male connection of our shore power cord had melted. Two out of three prongs were stuck in the receptacle. We&#x27;ve never had issues with our cord before, and for now we assume that the marina shore connection was faulty. Either way, we had to repair the power cord.
We always prefer to repair than to replace, so when we returned to a place with a marine store, we got ourselves replacements connections, both male and female, to replace the two damaged ends.
We thought we&#x27;d document the process of fixing a shower power cord. Although, this is only specific to Marinco marine fittings.

                  <p>I know so many super-talented developers who share the same achilles heel: CSS. Instead of trying to “outrun” CSS, this article explores why leaning in and going deeper can be a tremendous boon for your development life and your career.</p>

                  <p>The z-index property can be a tricky little bugger. Sometimes, no matter how much you crank up the number, the element never rises to the top! In this article, we explore stacking contexts, and see how they can thwart our efforts to use z-index. We&#x27;ll also learn how to use this mechanism to our advantage.</p>

                  <p>Hello! On Wednesday I was talking to a friend about how it would be cool to
have an nginx playground website where you can just paste in an nginx config
and test it out. And then I realized it might actually be pretty easy to build,
so got excited and started coding and I built it. It’s at
https://nginx-playground.wizardzines.com.
Here’s a screenshot:

For the rest of the post I’m mostly going to talk about how I built the
project, because there were a few decisions that weren’t obvious to me.
how to use it
You need to enter both an nginx config and a curl or http command to make a
HTTP request to that nginx instance
And then you click “Run” in the top right, and it’ll output either:
the results of the command you executed (if nginx started successfully), or
the nginx error logs (if nginx …</p>

                  <p>Do you remember when having a great website was enough? Now, people are getting answers from Siri, Google search snippets, and mobile apps, not just our websites. Forward-thinking organizations have adopted an omnichannel content strategy, whose mission is to reach audiences across multiple digital channels and platforms.
But how do you set up a content management system (CMS) to reach your audience now and in the future? I learned the hard way that creating a content model—a definition of content types, attributes, and relationships that let people and systems understand content—with my more familiar design-system thinking would capsize my customer’s omnichannel content strategy. You can avoid that outcome by creating content models that are semantic and that also connect related content.…</p>

something potentially useful for other people.  It&#x27;s something I
have mentioned before,
but it seems like maybe that post didn&#x27;t have enough specifics to
make it really &quot;land&quot; when someone else does a web search.


On a Wednesday night not so long ago, someone opened a SEV (that is, a 
notification of something going wrong) and said the individual tasks for 
their service were &quot;crash looping&quot;.  These things ran in an environment 
where they were supervised by the job runner, so if they died, they&#x27;d be 
restarted, but you never wanted to keep it in this kind of state.


It looked like this had started when some update had rolled out.  That 
is, prior to the update, their service was fine.  After they changed 
something, it s…</p>

                  <p>In 2008, Mark Changizi, a Sloan-Swartz Fellow in Theoretical Neuroscience at Caltech, noted that the eye can make sense of complex relationships that often mystify the brain. 


Our everyday visual perceptions rely upon unfathomably complex computations carried out by tens of billions of neurons across over half our cortex. In spite of this, it does not “feel” like work to see. Our cognitive powers are, in stark contrast, “slow and painful,” and we have great trouble with embarrassingly simple logic tasks. 

Might it be possible to harness our visual computational powers for other tasks, perhaps for tasks cognition finds difficult? 


In other words, could we trick the eye into performing computation? 

Changizi proposed the Escher Circuit, &quot;a special kind of image that amounts to &#x27;visual software&#x27; our &#x27;visual hardware&#x27; computes&quot; merely through perception.

Escher Circuits work by creating different states corresponding to how the eye resolves ambiguous images. Its core component, the wire, holds a state of 0 when we perceive it as if we are to the right of it; otherwise, it holds a state of 1.

                  <p>I have an older iPhone that used to be my daily driver.  It mostly just 
hangs around for testing random junk.  It&#x27;s still getting updates, and 
so when Apple offered it iOS 15 today, I installed it.  This gave me a 
chance to turn on their beta &quot;private relay&quot; stuff which seems to be 
a TOR-like system.


What did surprise me is the lack of &quot;stickiness&quot; for these IP addresses.  
Every five seconds or so, it seems to hop to another address in the same 
(IPv6, remember) /64.  If you&#x27;re not down with v6 conventions yet, this 
means the first four parts like &quot;xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx&quot; stay the same, but 
the last four change completely every time.


I actually don&#x27;t have any v4-only (aka LEGACY) stuff to try it on, so I 
have no idea what happens on that side of the world.  It probably looks 
about the same, albeit within a much smaller range of possible source IP 
addresses.  It probably resembles a CGNAT type situation.

It&#x27;ll be fun to see what this breaks, and who howls the loudest.</p>

                  <p>Hello! This post (like patterns in confusing explanations)
is another one in the “julia attempts to articulate her teaching strategy”
series.
I’ll start out by talking about a “backwards” approach to learning
that I think a lot of you will recognize (do projects first without fully
understanding what you’re doing, fill in missing knowledge after), and then
talk about I try to teach in a way that works better with that mode of
learning.
how I’ve learned programming: backwards
There are a lot of “basic” concepts in programming, like memory management,
networking, operating systems, assembly, etc. You could imagine that you learn
programming by first starting with the basic concepts and then learning
abstractions on top of those concepts.
But, even though I have a very traditional CS backgrou…</p>

                  <p>I&#x27;ve been struggling to get my head around voltage and amps - specifically after I bought a device that wanted 5V and 2A supply, but I was only giving it 1.6A I found the machine would fail (and reboot). The lack of amperage meant it wasn&#x27;t able to supply the entire board.
Just the image from this post was enough to make it click in my head 👍


VOLTAGE is like the pressure that pushes water through the hose. It is measured in volts (V).


CURRENT is like the diameter of the hose. The wider it is, the more water will flow through. It is measured in amps (I or A).


RESISTANCE is like sand in the hose that slows down the water flow. It is measured in ohms (R or Ω).

                  <p>Hello! I was talking to a Python programmer friend yesterday about debugging,
and I mentioned that I really like debugging using a REPL. He said he’d never
tried it and that it sounded fun, so I thought I’d write a quick post about it.
This debugging method doesn’t work in a lot of languages, but it does work in
Python and Ruby and kiiiiiind of in C (via gdb).
what’s a REPL?
REPL stands for “read eval print loop”. A REPL is a program that:
reads some input from you like print(f&quot;2 + 2 &#x3D; {2+2}&quot;) (read)
evaluates the input (eval)
print out the result (print)
and then goes back to step 1 (loop)
Here’s an example of me using the IPython REPL to run a print statement. (also
it demonstrates f-strings, my favourite Python 3 feature)

                  <p>There’s been a recent discussion on Twitter about the idea of adding a new element in HTML that represents a search interface. A search form, basically.
The idea is to create a semantic HTML element for the ARIA search role, which represents a landmark region “that contains a collection of items and objects that, as a whole, combine to create a search facility.”
Opinions have been shared in the Twitter thread about whether adding a new HTML element is necessary. Many have argued that it was unnecessary because we can use the ARIA search role and repurpose a form element to create the same semantics. I disagree. And this article is the longer version of my personal opinion on the subject.

                  <p>Hello! I was talking to a friend yesterday who was studying for a programming
interview and trying to learn some algorithms basics.
The topic of quadratic-time vs linear-time algorithms came up, I thought this
would be fun to write about here because avoiding quadratic-time algorithms
isn’t just important in interviews – it’s sometimes good to know about in real
life too! I’ll explain what a “quadratic-time algorithm is” in a minute :)
here are the 3 things we’ll talk about:
quadratic time functions are WAY WAY WAY slower than linear time functions
sometimes you can make a quadratic algorithm into a linear algorithm by using a hashmap
this is because hashmaps lookups are very fast (instant!)
I’m going to try to keep the math jargon to a minimum and focus on real code
examples and how fast/…</p>

                  <p>March 2020 brought to the world a scenario we only imagined possible in dystopian novels. Once bustling cities and towns were desolate. In contrast, the highways and byways of the internet were completely congested with people grasping for human connection, and internet friends became more important than ever.  Since then, there have been countless discussions […]

It’s a wonderful set of talks that happens every GDC in which each speaker is given five minutes to talk about anything they want. I talked about desktop pets, desktop toys, and why that entire concept is such a valuable mode of expression. I actually plan on writing a much longer, and more in-depth post about this (it might end up being a longer talk too), as soon as I have time… It’s a topic that has really grown on me because I think it offers so much...</p>

                  <p>I wrote this a couple of years ago in another context, but it looks like 
it&#x27;s still just as applicable today, so I decided to bring it out from 
behind the permission curtain.  This originally was only visible to 
coworkers who happened to look at my feed.  Now it isn&#x27;t.


Code runs on people.  Please keep it simple.


You can throw all kinds of wicked, nasty, complicated, 
Klein-bottle-wannabe tricks into code and the computer will shrug and 
slog on through it.


Nobody will ever have more state about the code than the original author 
at the time of creation.  Everything after that pales in comparison.  If 
it takes an hour to figure out what&#x27;s going on, well, that&#x27;s an hour 
that wasn&#x27;t spent doing something else more useful and interesting.


We get it, you&#x27;re clever.  But the business doesn&#x27;t need clever. It 
needs code that is only as complicated as absolutely necessary to get 
the job done.  Anything else is just wasted effort.


If a problem calls for clever, okay, then have at it.  But I bet it 
doesn&#x27;t.  Most things really don&#x27;t. Be honest with yourself, and with 
your future coworkers.  It makes for a healthier environment. 


I think this was originally written as an indirect response to some 
&quot;clever-wielding&quot; that had been witnessed on one of my tours of duty in 
some infrastructure team.  It&#x27;s not clear that it had any positive 
effect, though.  These things are hard to measure after the fact, 
particularly once the &quot;look how high I can pile up the clever&quot; culture 
has infected a team thoroughly and it starts being rewarded.</p>

They&#x27;re the &quot;remote proctoring&quot; company that boomed during the pandemic by promising that they could stop exam cheating through gross, discriminatory privacy invasions and snake-oil machine learning. In case you&#x27;ve lost the thread (it&#x27;s been a minute), Proctorio is a tool that transforms students&#x27; personal computers into surveillance tools.

                  <p>Hey everyone! This is the list of all the changes we&#x27;ve done to our projects and apps during the month of August. We&#x27;ll also be reporting in our on position in the world, and on our future plans.
Summary Of Changes
Nasu, implemented a way to shift multiple tiles at once, and added a snarf buffer to copy/paste data between instances of Nasu.
Niju, completed, and released the project on itch.io.
Orca, implemented snarf buffer to easily bring patches in and out of it (uxn version).
Uxn, massive re-write of the Uxn VM, and CollapseOS now runs on Uxn.
Paradise, started on a Uxn-native version.
noodle, created a mascot, and added a tiny animation toolkit.
    
100r.co, added various hand drawn images to the knowledge base.
News
This month, our little engine was fixed (read about it here) we&#x27;ve been sailing around the Gulf Islands, working from anchor. We also found Iggy&#x27;s successor, a used fiberglass dinghy that we&#x27;ve named Teapot. We&#x27;ve been rowing it from ship to shore, and it&#x27;s so, so nice. We stopped by Saltspring Island and got to meet the sailors on BosunBird, a couple who have traveled around the world on a Vancouver27. Their blog was an invaluable resource for us on our travels through Japan. 
We&#x27;ve released a solid version of noodle, our drawing tool. Follow the tutorial on our website, or check out this amazing quick start guide by Polyducks. We also released niju, our little kana-learning game. Niju was a trial to see if we could design, write and assemble a project entirely within the Uxn computer.
Our friends at Compudanzas have released part 3, 4 and 5 of their Introduction to Uxn Programming tutorial.
Pino book club
Help. We still haven&#x27;t finished The Swarm by Frank Schatzing. It is terrible, but we can&#x27;t stop.

                  <p>A little while back I saw a technical demo that used the shell of MIDI controller and inserted a PS/2 keyboard (effectively) under the keys to then control a program on the ZX Spectrum Next.
This prompted me to buy a MIDI controller but I didn&#x27;t want to gut out the new hardware. So instead I found a way to map the USB MIDI to the PS/2 key presses, allowing me to use the piano keyboard on the retro hardware.</p>

post
about a big company project that dragged on for six months.  It elicited 
a bunch of responses in the usual places, but two or three of them were 
a little... off.  I figured I&#x27;d handle all of them at once right here.


I bet there was something that came up in the meeting where I said 
something like &quot;you should be able to talk to our server right now but 
give it a try and let us know if you can&#x27;t&quot;.  This meant that our RPC 
definitions were checked into source control like you&#x27;d expect, our 
service was already running in production (and NOT on someone&#x27;s dev 
machine), and it had a well-defined service name.  This means anyone who 
knew how to talk the company&#x27;s flavor of RPC could totally send it a 
request and get something back given just a little yak…</p>

This day in history: 2006, 2020 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading Inequality, not gerontocracy (permalink) The received wisdom among economists is that the US&#x27;s historical low interests rates are driven by high savings by aging boomers who are getting ready for, or in, retirement. The idea is boomers have salted away so much cash that banks don&#x27;t bid for their savings, so interest rates fall. But at last week&#x27;s Jackson Hole conference, a trio of economists presented a very different explanation for low interest, one that better fits the facts. In…</p>

                  <p>Collisions between the personal and the commercial in open-source have become familiar, like when an irate independent developer pulled a widely-used package entirely in 2016 bringing down hundreds of projects. But we don&#x27;t expect a commercial enterprise to suddenly discover a package they have long relied on forbids any use at all—and does so for a very good reason.

This was the realization for dapr, a “portable, serverless, event-driven runtime,” with 14k stars on GitHub, when an issue was opened last week about its dependency bouk/monkey. Monkey&#x27;s license, in its entirety, reads:


I do not give anyone permissions to use this tool for any purpose. Don’t use it.

I’m not interested in changing this license. Please don’t ask.


It raises the question: do even corporate entities read the licenses of packages they use? While Dapr was called out, Arduino, SalesForce, and hundreds of other projects also reference Monkey.

                  <p>Unstoppable page turner.
I&#x27;m not known for reading books quickly - heck, the last book I read was 45 pages (or 80 pages, or 90 pages, or something low according to Kindle) and it took me a week to read.
This book is 400+ pages and I swallowed it in a matter of days. I cannot resist Hunter&#x27;s writing style and it has me ending each chapter/section with &quot;just one more…&quot;.
Great stuff. It also brings in some of the end of book 4 - All The Rage into a larger storyline.
The writing is certainly formulaic to some degree, but that&#x27;s not particularly a bad thing and having familiarity with the characters, for me having read all the DI Adam Fawley series, means I can follow along at a much more interesting pace through the book.
I suspect this is classic &quot;beach reading&quot; if I were the type. I&#x27;ve enjoyed every one of Hunter&#x27;s books I&#x27;ve read so far and I&#x27;ll be pre-ordering the sixth installment: and easy choice.</p>

                  <p>As I write this, it&#x27;s the evening of the 30th of August. Previous years, indeed the last decade, this evening is terribly painful for me. This evening, 11 years ago Julie and I arrived at hospital, around this precise time, to find that during the late stages of labour, Tia&#x27;s heartbeat had stopped.
Previous years, this evening specifically I try hard to hold the pain (and fear and anger) at arm&#x27;s length.
This year has been different. As each year has always been different. No different bad or different good. Different… peaceful.</p>
