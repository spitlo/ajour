                  <p>Hello! Today I want to talk about – how do you know you’re getting better at programming?
One obvious approach is:
make goals
periodically check if you achieved those goals
if you did, celebrate
I kind of hate goals
Goals can be useful, but a lot of the time I actually find them stressful and
not that helpful. For example, here are a few goals I wrote down for myself 9
years ago:
write a nontrivial amount of C code that works and is used by actual people
contribute to an open source project in C
learn C++
9 years later, I have done 0 of those things. With the “goal” framing, it’s to
think of this as a bad thing! Like, I wanted to learn C++ and I didn’t! I still
can’t write C comfortably! Oh no! I guess I failed!
I find this framing depressing and unhelpful. In reality, I didn’t have any re…</p>

                  <p>I sometimes write the beginnings of posts but don&#x27;t post them.  I still 
save them in case conditions change or other things happen and make me 
want to follow up on the topic.  In this case, I wrote something about 
offices before the whole COVID lockdown thing happened and people 
largely stopped going to offices every day.  With that in mind, let&#x27;s 
proceed.

brought about this whole notion of &quot;microkitchens&quot;.  This is where

                  <p>One of the fun things I used to do at a prior job was to dig through the 
raw data points which were collected from the *many* servers we had.  I 
could just pick an interesting-sounding metric and then would just ask 
the system to show me the top 10 or bottom 10 out of a population of 
thousands or more.


To get my feet wet with the whole &quot;investigations&quot; thing that we&#x27;d do, I 
started looking into this one day and chose one of the many temp sensors 
which were being logged by the servers.  I forget exactly which one it 
was, for there were many.  The CPUs logged it, the chassis logged it, 
the power supply logged it, and so on.  There were so many choices.


I went looking for a reason.  What could possibly explain this?  First 
off, it didn&#x27;t line up with any obvious pattern in the host names.  The 
hosts were named for whichever team owned them, followed by a sequence 
number that was bumped any time a new one was provisioned.  There was no 
signal to be found in that.


There was more, though.  You could also see a &quot;rack position&quot; in this 
data, and now it started getting interesting.  It seems that all of the 
really hot machines had a rack position of something low, like 04 or 05, 
and never anything higher than that.  In fact, when looking at a whole 
rack, it was always the lowest number of all of the positions that were 
being used.  Now this was worth chasing!


It&#x27;s good that I asked, since they told me something surprising: 
position 04 or 05 or whatever was the *bottom* of the rack.  Yes, 
somehow, the lowest machine in the rack was the hottest!  They found 
this interesting, too, and wound up digging into it.  Given that I was 
far away in a distant office, this was the best way for us to proceed.


The problem was that the bottommost server would have nothing below it 
but just open space until it got to the floor.  That space would not 
move air efficiently, and it obviously mattered.


This rolled out and my hot spots disappeared.  Fantastic!</p>

                  <p>Another day, another bit of local flavor, but this time it&#x27;s something I 
wish I didn&#x27;t have to write about.

wrote
about seeing a maintenance truck rolling down the Caltrain line in 
Mountain View.  It had a special attachment to let it stay on the rails.  
At no point did the arms come down for the crossing.  It managed to 
approach, then the people inside looked around and went through, and the 
arms never budged.  There were no flashing lights or bells.




caught fire.  A bunch of people were hurt.  More were shaken 
up.


I&#x27;m assuming their construction trucks don&#x27;t trigger the &quot;short the 
rails together to signal various things&quot; logic, either.  This would 
mean that crossing arms stay up... and I have to assume it also means 
the signals along the way stay green instead of going red.

We will presumably hear more about whatever the signals said, and 
whether the train went past a red signal or not.  I just have a bad 
feeling that they saw a green and kept on going.</p>

                  <p>Hello! A couple of days I wrote about tiny personal programs, and I mentioned that
it can be fun to use “secret” undocumented APIs where you need to copy your
cookies out of the browser to get access to them.
A couple of people asked how to do this, so I wanted to explain how because
it’s pretty straightforward. We’ll also talk a tiny bit about what can go
wrong, ethical issues, and how this applies to your undocumented APIs.
As an example, let’s use Google Hangouts. I’m picking this not because it’s the
most useful example (I think there’s an official API which would be much more
practical to use), but because many sites where this is actually useful are
smaller sites that are more vulnerable to abuse. So we’re just going to use
Google Hangouts because I’m 100% sure that the Google Hangou…</p>

                  <p>Here&#x27;s a little bit of Silicon Valley local flavor for a change.  We 
have this freeway that runs from San Jose to San Francisco called US 
101, or around here, just &quot;101&quot;.  (Southern California has it too, but 
they call it &quot;the&quot; 101.  That&#x27;s how we detect invaders.)  Anyway, this 
thing is usually eight or more lanes up and down the peninsula, and it&#x27;s 
had a &quot;diamond&quot; or car pool lane on the #1 (innermost/&quot;fast&quot;) lane for 
many years.  You had to have a certain number of people in the car (or 
some other conditions met) during certain hours (AM and PM rush, 
weekdays), or you&#x27;d be in for a hefty ticket.


How does the system know what to charge you?  Well, you either have an 
old-style toll transponder that always bills you as a solo driver, or 
you have a new-style transponder with a 1/2/3+ switch that tells the 
road how to handle you.


Think about what this does to enforcement.  Now, instead of just &quot;is 
there a vehicle in the lane&quot;, &quot;is it the right time during a weekday&quot;, 
and &quot;how many people are in the car&quot;, now it&#x27;s also a matter of &quot;do they 
have their transponder set properly&quot;.

story
about how you can hose your machine by pointing the Linux kernel at a 
custom core dump handler and then have that handler fail to function.  
This&#x27;ll clog up the pipe (really), and then everything else will just 
stack up behind it.  Pretty soon, every crashing process will be stuck 
just the same.


Once upon a time, in a big company environment, someone decided that 
they wanted to provide a service to other things running on the same 
Linux box.  But, instead of either writing Yet Another Service (tm) 
that would go through release processes and all of that good stuff, they 
went for a different design entirely.


There are so many problems with this.  You have the issue of a &quot;server&quot;

                  <p>If a web site makes an RSS or Atom feed available, it&#x27;s not a bad idea 
to poll it from time to time.  Actually doing that poll like a good 
netizen (remember that concept?) takes a little attention to detail.


Given the reality of the situation, does it make sense to poll every 10 
seconds?  Probably not, right?  Someone set up something like that and 
left it running for a couple of months until I finally noticed it and 
dealt with it myself.


Given this, you can keep track of the &quot;Last-Modified&quot; header when you 
get a copy of the feed.  Then, you can turn around and use that same

                  <p>I was talking to a friend last summer about what resources might be helpful for
folks learning to program. My friend said they thought some people might
benefit from a list of small and fun programming projects – the kind of thing
you can do in an evening or weekend.
So let’s talk about that! I like to write small programs that have some
marginal utility in my life. Kind of like this:
ah! A minor problem in my life!
I know, I bet I can solve this problem with CODE. YAY.
4 hours of happy programming ensues
This isn’t always the most practical (many of the problems I’ve
solved with programming could have been solved in less time in other ways), but
as long as your goal is actually to have fun programming and your programs
don’t hurt anyone else, I think this is a great approach :)

                  <p>Here&#x27;s a concept: &quot;ssh to prod and edit directly on the machine&quot; is 
generally bad news.


I should point out that I didn&#x27;t know this person and had no idea how 
they would respond to such feedback - it might have been fine!  They 
might be a well-adjusted person who can take a request like that and not 
turn it around into a full-on nuclear attack.  But, I didn&#x27;t know either 
way.


At some point, I actually had a meeting with this developer for some 
other reason, and what happened was kind of amazing.  First thing, he 
brought it up and asked me about it.  I said something like, &quot;well, I 
didn&#x27;t want to get into it, but since you asked&quot;, and proceeded into 
something along the lines of &quot;obviously it would be best if you didn&#x27;t 
do that - sshing in and twiddling Python files on the actual production 
AWS instance of the service&quot;.


&quot;But... I suspect you are doing it for some reason?&quot;


My response was... I hope... reasonable: &quot;So as much as I would love to 
say &#x27;don&#x27;t do that!!!&#x27;, I&#x27;m not going to stand in the way of you 
literally doing your job.  So please proceed with care, and keep an eye 
open for some day when (first dumb thing) and (second dumb thing) aren&#x27;t 
problems any more and you need not do this any more.&quot;


It was either &quot;edit in prod&quot; or endure DAY LONG development cycles: make 
a change, wait 24 hours, come back tomorrow, and try it again.  That&#x27;s 
how broken it was.


The best part about this was that we had a totally reasonable 
conversation about it.  It&#x27;s the kind of thing which had become a rare 
commodity in those days at that place.


Would I expect someone else to go to that level of insanity every single 
time they just want to get their job done?  Absolutely not.

Editing files in prod to develop them?  That&#x27;s bad news.  Deliberately 
rigging tunnels to spoof a connection from prod?  That&#x27;s also bad news.  
Having to do them to get your job done?  You might be in the bad place.</p>

                  <p>Quite a while back, I wrote a post that basically went like this: if 
someone has a problem with someone else or something that person is 
doing, they&#x27;re going to find a way to get to &quot;no&quot;.  They will find some 
reason, some excuse, or some problem with it.  They&#x27;ll bring up a point 
and you&#x27;ll show that this is not in fact a thing.  They will then pivot 
again and again.


But, as I said, that was back then, and this time I&#x27;m talking about 
something else: when it happens in person with a coworker.  I had an 
experience like this a few years back, and figured I&#x27;d share how it goes 
for the sake of others who might not have encountered it yet, or who 
have and thought they were alone in this.

Central banks scrambled to react. Businesses shuttered. People lost their homes. Many governments fell. Faith in our institutions shattered. The Occupy movement was launched. So was Bitcoin. What brought on the Great Financial Crisis? The &quot;shadow banking system&quot; – a system of unregulated financial activities that are just like their regulated cousins, except that they&#x27;re, well, unregulated. The GFC was precipitated by &quot;financial innovation&quot;: new tricks that allowed …</p>

                  <p>This is a short one since it&#x27;s somewhere between a random bit of 
&quot;grab some popcorn&quot; amusement and a &quot;huh, that might be a problem some 
day&quot;.  In short, it looks like every Raspberry Pi filesystem installed 
from any given release image probably ends up with the same
UUID.


For instance, if you downloaded the &quot;lite&quot; version of Raspbian between 
roughly November 8th and January 28th, you probably got a file called 
2021-10-30-raspios-bullseye-armhf-lite.zip.  Inside, there&#x27;s an image, 
and the idea is that you dump that straight to your SD card, cram it in 
the Pi, and off you go.  The second partition on that image is an ext4 
filesystem which was created on some build machine somewhere.  The UUID 
on it never gets &quot;evolved&quot; to something else after the install.


You can see it inside the image itself here:


Or, if you actually installed a few of these things like I did over the 
past couple of months, you can just &#x27;tune2fs -l /dev/mmcblk0p2&#x27; and see 
the same value in there.


Don&#x27;t end up with a pile of SD cards on your desk and think &quot;I know, 
I&#x27;ll use the filesystem UUIDs to track which one goes where&quot;, in other 
words.


If it&#x27;s not breaking anything for you, it&#x27;s probably best to just let it 
be.  Untangling a boot mess on these weird little boxes is anything but 
fun.

Note: if you&#x27;re actually on a recent Raspberry Pi, odds are good that 
your /etc/fstab will be using *partition* UUIDs (PARTUUID&#x3D;...) and not 
those of the filesystem.  If in doubt, use blkid to see what&#x27;s what.</p>

I’ve written these tool roundups so much that I started a “Tools” category, and my Cool Tools itch curation keeps growing. I didn’t think this is something you could keep up...</p>

was trained on a whole mess of repositories and their code, and you can 
&quot;prompt&quot; it and it&#x27;ll spit out code that may or may not do what you 
want.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to know about licensing (BSD, GPL, MIT, that sort 
of thing), or plagiarism, or any of that other good stuff.


This is actually a story about somewhere I used to work, and someone who 
was on one of my teams back in the day.  One day, I heard that one of 
the people in a far-away office had created some kind of tool that would 
let you look at the status of different machines - that is, Linux boxes.

Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading Amazon&#x27;s $31b &quot;ad business&quot; isn&#x27;t (permalink) Looking at Amazon&#x27;s quarterly financials, it would be easy to mistake the company&#x27;s $31b ad division as a serious shift in the online advertising industry, but that would be a huge mistake. You see, Amazon&#x27;s not really selling ads. Nearly all of that $31b is for an &quot;ad&quot; on Amazon itself: that is it&#x27;s Amazon collecting billions from the sellers who rely on the company as their main retail channel, who are locked in a bidding war to buy the top spots in search and product pages. This is a huge shift for Amazon in every way. …</p>

                  <p>There are some interesting implications to the way that you have to 
handle references to other bits of code when you write a C++ header 
file.  There are things you can do which turn out to be suboptimal, and 
until or unless you work someplace with a coding style document or get 
some mentor who&#x27;s already been there, you&#x27;re likely to make some
mistakes.


Anyway, a common way to do this is to set up the outer class such that 
it has a pointer to the inner one.  You *could* have it just own it 
directly, but then that introduces problems.

  Bar bar_;



Of course, bar.h probably has its own dependencies which get #included, 
and so now you end up with this evil web of slow compiles.  It sucks.


What used to happen next is that someone would say, okay, let&#x27;s make it

                  <p>Hello! Here are some things you may or may not have noticed about DNS:
when you resolve a DNS name in a Python program, it checks /etc/hosts, but when you use dig, it doesn’t.
switching Linux distributions can sometimes change how your DNS works, for example if you use Alpine Linux instead of Ubuntu it can cause problems.
Mac OS has DNS caching, but Linux doesn’t necessarily unless you use systemd-resolved or something
To understand all of these, we need to learn about a function called
getaddrinfo which is responsible for doing DNS lookups.
There are a bunch of surprising-to-me things about getaddrinfo, and once I
learned about them, it explained a bunch of the confusing DNS behaviour I’d
seen in the past.
where does getaddrinfo come from?
getaddrinfo is part of a library called libc whic…</p>

                  <p>Yesterday, I
put forth
a bunch of API possibilities for the problem of needing to return a 
value but also indicating the lack of a value and being able to comment 
on why.  In it, the notion of a &quot;wrapper&quot; around a string was presented, 
such that it might look like &quot;Result&quot;, and those brackets 
started looking like a pain.  There was also the possibility of having 
something like &quot;ResultString&quot;, but didn&#x27;t that open the door to having a 
bunch of code duplication?


After this had existed for a while, the general happy feeling of having 
this stuff in place became infectious.  I wanted it to cover other 
things with it, too.  I wanted it to handle something a bit more 
complicated than a mere string, and so decided to try my hand at the

                  <p>If you agree with the notion that you need to be able to tell the 
difference between the absence of a value and a value itself, then this 
has some impacts on the code you write.  If you want to keep &#x27;em 
separated (so they can come out and play), then it gets you looking at 
your API designs in certain ways.


Imagine we&#x27;re talking about a helper function that is intended to be run 
inside a program that&#x27;s handling the access to a web page.  It&#x27;s 
probably a CGI program, but it could also be buried inside some much 
bigger thing, too.  This is all about C++ styles, but you can probably 
see slices of other languages in here, too.

So I asked on Twitter about programming things that used to be hard and are now easy

found reading the list really fun and it gave me some ideas for things to
learn. Maybe it’ll give you some ideas too.

In some ways, Pluralistic&#x27;s long form essays are the dividends for the 20+ years I&#x27;ve been a daily blogger. All those short pieces I&#x27;ve written over the preceding decades are …</p>

I mentioned taking my old Mac Mini out of the OS X/macos ecosystem and

attempted to install a Javascript linter (and it tried to drag in 180+ 
node-related packages).

manifests in the real world.


My relative inexperience with Debian systems means I&#x27;m constantly being 
delighted to discover that such and such has already been packaged up 
and is just an apt command away.  Things that I would have done by hand 
in the years up to this point now have someone else worrying about them.


This is what happened next:

                  <p>Oh dear.  The software fungus where bits of code take the
literal characters &quot;HTTP&quot; as a number
has expanded.  Now it has a variant: 4740180.


Where does this one come from?  
Go and gRPC, apparently!


I found this while searching the web for &quot;1213486160&quot; to see how things 
have been going in the past few years.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s still biting 
people all over the place.  There are far too many posts asking people 
to upgrade their software, or restart things, or do any number of 
useless rubber-chicken-waving techniques which ultimately will 
accomplish nothing.

When you see a funny-looking number, figure out where it comes from.
That&#x27;s the only way to have any chance of understanding what&#x27;s actually 
going on.</p>

&quot;process infection&quot; story:

https://lwn.net/Articles/883547/):


If you do privileged execution of specific operations via IPC you get 
the guarantee that whatever is done, is done from a well-defined, 
pristine execution environment, without leaking context implicitly. The 
IPC message is the *full* vulnerable surface, and that&#x27;s as minimal as 
it can get. And that&#x27;s great.




Oh wow, thank you for mentioning that, unnamed reader!  I definitely 
read that post on LWN at some point in the past couple of days when the 
pkexec thing started going around.  It must have really worked its way 
into my head, and then eventually stirred up the memory of everything 
getting &quot;nicely infected&quot; at $OLD_JOB.

                  <p>I’m working on a zine about DNS right now, so I’ve been thinking about DNS
terminology a lot more than a normal person. Here’s something slightly
confusing I’ve noticed about DNS terminology!
Two of the most common DNS server terms (“nameserver” and “DNS resolver”)
have different meanings depending on the situation.
Now this isn’t a problem if you already understand how DNS works – I can
easily figure out what type of “nameserver” is being discussed based on
context.
But it can be a problem if you’re trying to learn how DNS works and you don’t
realize that those words might refer to different things depending on the
context – it’s confusing! So I’m going to explain the different possible
meanings and how to figure out which meaning is intended.

                  <p>I once worked at a place that had an interesting little problem stemming 
from the way they managed machines and some of the fun side-effects 
processes can have on each other.  This is back in the pre-systemd days 
of running services, such that things tended to be started or restarted 
by someone or something that itself ran as root.  That is, if you 
started something, it might inherit one or more things from your 
environment.  Likewise, if you ran something with an unusual 
environment, it might bestow those &quot;gifts&quot; onto anything it happened to 
touch.


After locking themselves out of machines too many times, people 
generally learned that after you mess with a glibc upgrade, you restart 
the sshd listener on port 22.  Of course, they also had to learn to not 
whack EVERY sshd at the…</p>

I&#x27;d seen this before and suspected that the game couldn&#x27;t be loaded due to corruption during boot (on the GB side). I was wrong, but I definitely enjoyed the challenge!

Opening up the Gameboy up and took a peek, and yep, found game pak loading doberry had been messed with. Bit of a duff job on whoever tried to repair it before me - and it even looks like they spotted there was a short and tried to slice through it with a knife:

Pins A2 and A1 were definitely connected! Some flux and solder later and it looks more like this:

And now the Gameboy boots with a nice clean Nintendo logo. Except… it doesn&#x27;t go past that point at all - and in fact the screen looks like it&#x27;s doing some weird flash dance, goi…</p>

                  <p>Hello! I wrote a comic last week called “life of a DNS query” that explains how
DNS resolvers work.
In this post, I want to explain how DNS resolvers work in a different way –

The main function (resolve) is actually just 20 lines, including comments.
I usually find it easier to understand things work when they come in the form
of programs that I can run and modify and poke at, so hopefully this program

                  <p>I’ve been having a hard time understanding IPv6. On one hand, the basics initially seem pretty
straightforward (there aren’t enough IPv4 addresses for all the devices on the
internet, so people invented IPv6! There are enough IPv6 addresses for
everyone!)
But when I try to actually understand it, I run into a lot of questions. One
question is: twitter.com does not support IPv6. Presumably it can’t be causing
them THAT many issues to not support it. So why do websites support IPv6?
I asked people on Twitter why their servers support IPv6
and I got a lot of great answers, which I’ll summarize here. These all come
with the disclaimer that I have basically 0 experience with IPv6 so I can’t evaluate these reasons very well.
First though, I want to explain why it’s possible for twitter.com to no…</p>

and used it in an analogy.  First, I&#x27;ll just show the image and explain 
what you&#x27;re looking at here.




I do remember the description from the back: this is a picture of *part 
of* something that was called the Software Creations BBS.  It was a 
multi-line bulletin board system where you could dial up and send 
messages to people, upload and download files, and (presumably) play 
online games (&quot;doors&quot;) and anything else they cared to offer.

64 machines in a little space.  I have to assume 
they are at least 
286s (ATs, more or 
less), but it&#x27;s impossible to tell from just this picture.  They could 
have been 386s or even 486s by that point, but …</p>

                  <p>Okay, so yesterday I 
posted
a picture of an old multi-line bulletin board system which had 
apparently taken over an entire bedroom with dozens of computers.  I 
mentioned that I intended to come back to the topic to throw in my own 
two cents, and so here we go.


Or, were you someone who found it horrific and wished there was a 
simpler way?  Did you wonder if it would be possible to pack all of that 
into one or maybe two boxes, instead?  Did you want a way to negate all 
of that complexity while still providing the same level of service?


Now, things are different.  I look at that and just sigh at the lost 
opportunities.  The actual amount of work being done on behalf of any of 
the users who are connected is tiny.  If we ignore the fact that the 
actual BBS software and related acc…</p>

                  <p>Hello! Recently I’ve been thinking about putting my static sites on servers
that I run myself instead of using managed services like Netlify or GitHub
Pages.
Originally I thought that running my own servers would require a lot of
maintenance and be a huge pain, but I was chatting with Wesley about what kind
of maintainance their servers require, and
they convinced me that it might not be that bad.
So I decided to try out moving all my static sites to a $5/month server to see
what it was like.
Everything in here is pretty standard but I wanted to write down what I did
anyway because there are a surprising number of decisions and I like to see
what choices other people make.
the constraint: only static sites
To keep things simple, I decided that this server would only run nginx and
only serv…</p>

It exists – and is hundreds of years old. The hot water bottle could save a great deal of energy and money without sacrificing thermal comfort. Hot water bottles work both indoors and outdoors. Illustration: Marie Verdeil. A hot water bottle is a sealable container filled with hot water, often enclosed in a textile cover, which is directly placed against a part of the body for thermal comfort. The hot water bottle is still a common household item in some places – such as the UK and Japan – but it is largely forgotten or...</p>

                  <p>When I first learned about it, DNS didn’t seem like it should be THAT
complicated. Like, there are DNS records, they’re stored on a server, what’s
the big deal?
But with DNS, reading about how it works in a textbook doesn’t prepare you for
the sheer volume of different ways DNS can break your system in practice. It’s
not just caching problems!
So I asked people on Twitter for
example of DNS problems they’ve run into, especially DNS problems that didn’t
initially appear to be DNS problems. (the popular “it’s always DNS” meme)
I’m not going to discuss how to solve or avoid any of these problems in this
post, but I’ve linked to webpages discussing the problem where I could find
them.
