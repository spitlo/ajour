was at the company.  Nobody was going to just tell me, so I had to just 
try a bunch of things to see how much could be learned from poking 
around.


At one of them, there were two people representing a single outage.  One 
of them (&quot;user&quot;) was from this team that used GPUs to compute something 
or other.  The other one (&quot;service&quot;) managed the team that ran the 
gunk that let people ask for machines with GPUs so they can run stuff.  
What happened is that &quot;service&quot; presented it as &quot;user screwed up and 
was down because of some stuff that happened&quot;.


It turned out to be a completely different story than the one they were 
pitching.  In fact, what happened is that the &quot;service&quot; team made some

About the conference (what, when, where)
Access All Areas (or aaa) is a new online conference—part of a series of focussed conferences created by the folks at Web Directions. This conference is focussed on accessibility for developers: understanding the different kinds of accessibility issues that our code may create, finding those issues using available auditing and testing tools, as well as techniques and technologies for addressing them.
This inclusive, remote-friendly conference will take place for the first time this year …</p>

News
This month, Calcifer is being re-built. While we wait for that, we&#x27;re working on more projects aboard. We added insulation to the v-berth, an attempt to keep Pino warm this winter. We created a new portal called boat projects on our wiki that covers most of the major construction projects we&#x27;ve done to the boat.
Our friends at Compudanzas have started writing an Introduction to Uxn Programming tutorial. We recommend it to anyone interested in programming for the Uxn Computer. No prior understanding of stack-machines, or Assembly, required! The first covers basics, and the latest chapter focuses on learning to draw pixels on the screen.
If you missed Devine&#x27;s performance at Flash Crash, you can watch it here.

A grifter, on the other hand, is someone who can work the law to declare your stuff to be their stuff, which makes you a lawless cur because your pockets are stuffed full of their money and merely handing it over is the least you can do to make up for your sin.

                  <p>We’ve been having conversations for thousands of years. Whether to convey information, conduct transactions, or simply to check in on one another, people have yammered away, chattering and gesticulating, through spoken conversation for countless generations. Only in the last few millennia have we begun to commit our conversations to writing, and only in the last few decades have we begun to outsource them to the computer, a machine that shows much more affinity for written correspondence than for the slangy vagaries of spoken language.
Computers have trouble because between spoken and written language, speech is more primordial. To have successful conversations with us, machines must grapple with the messiness of human speech: the disfluencies and pauses, the gestures and body language, an…</p>

                  <p>The work is done. Building a dry toilet was more work than we had anticipated, but we still prefer it over the ready-made models. We learned tons doing it, and now our toilet is perfectly suited to our space. The pandemic has pushed more people into boat and van living (to travel within their own countries) and towards simple systems. Looking at the Nature&#x27;s Head website, they&#x27;ve had a 8-week waiting list for ages. It&#x27;s either you wait for the thing, or you build the thing.

                  <p>The game went live just under a week ago and the feedback has been really nice to see.
There&#x27;s been a balance of &quot;regular&quot; players and power players, and in those power players is where the game got some more much needed play testing.
The one thing that I had designed into the game was the unlimited undo. The side effect was that, technically, there&#x27;s infinite ability to make your way through the game so long as you had time and patience - a lot of patience!
The knock on problem with infinite moves is that the score really isn&#x27;t infinite. In fact, I alluded to that in a previous devlog because the score is a 16bit value, it has a max range.
So with that, this new release adds a penalty to using the undo. I went through a lot of different ideas and tested them out to see how they affected the score. Here&#x27;s just a few that I tried:

Subtracting 100 points per undo
Halving the score per undo
Subtracting the number of blocks restored
Using the undo depth as a multiplier - as in: if you undo twice, the penalty is greater

These had either drastic effects on the score, which made it pointless, or very subtle effects which rendered the penalty ineffective.
What I settled on was using your progress as the multiplier. So, undo costs 25 points per undo on level 1. On level 2, it costs 50 points, level 3 75 points and so on.
This changes the dynamic of the game in a really interesting way. You start to consider the impact on your decisions against your score: do I continue with undo and risk it, or do I accept the fate of stable score and hope it&#x27;s good enough for a highscore?
There was also some fixes for the custom themes - around the palette because I require a custom palette for the game&#x27;s main tiles, but when you add your own custom tiles the game switches to the default Layer 2 palette - so there were fixes around that too. And here&#x27;s Gaz Mashall&#x27;s own custom theme in action behind a new user interface change:</p>

                  <p>I’m not sure when I first heard this quote, but it’s something that has stayed with me over the years. How do you create services for situations you can’t imagine? Or design products that work on devices yet to be invented?
Flash, Photoshop, and responsive design
When I first started designing websites, my go-to software was Photoshop. I created a 960px canvas and set about creating a layout that I would later drop content in. The development phase was about attaining pixel-perfect accuracy using fixed widths, fixed heights, and absolute positioning.
Ethan Marcotte’s talk at An Event Apart and subsequent article “Responsive Web Design” in A List Apart in 2010 changed all this. I was sold on responsive design as soon as I heard about it, but I was also terrified. The pixel-perfect designs f…</p>

I&#x27;ve only ever had a hearing test when I was a kid and I do remember even then they mentioned there was some slight loss. Hearing is important to the The Lenire System treatment because it plays audio to help rewire the brain, so if I have hearing damage, I won&#x27;t be suitable.</p>

                  <p>If you make a language and are lucky, someone else will write code for it. If you are very lucky, someone else will find uses for it you never intended, or that even challenge the premise of the language.

This is not the same as using the language in an unexpected way. Urban Müller could not have foreseen brainfuck as the bedrock for a Rust-like language or a CPU. But do these projects truly counter brainfuck&#x27;s premise? I would argue not. Brainfuck appears chaotic but part of its appeal has always been in conquering that chaos, in building efficient algorithms using the language despite the challenge. These projects counter the chaos of brainfuck, but that really is the appeal of brainfuck in the first place, they are simply taking it much further than could have been anticipated. If Müller had wanted brainfuck to be impossible to master, he would have designed the language much differently.

Sometimes, however, a language inspires work that falls very far from the intent of its original designer. Most esolangs, like mainstream programming languages, are open systems and don&#x27;t dictate how programmers use them. C# offers many features to make structured code easy. But I can also write C# that looks like 80s BASIC wrapped in some standard C# boilerplate:

How do you inspect an element that hides on mouse move? Such as a tooltip (though I&#x27;m not a fan of the UI element, if only for the lack of accessibility) it&#x27;s certainly not obvious.</p>

                  <p>When I write about programming, I spend a lot of time trying to come up with
good examples. I haven’t seen a lot written about how to make examples, so
here’s a little bit about my approach to writing examples!
The basic idea here is to start with real code that you wrote and then remove
irrelevant details to make it into a self-contained example instead of coming
up with examples out of thin air.
I’ll talk about two kinds of examples: realistic examples and suprising
examples.
good examples are realistic
To see why examples should be realistic, let’s first talk about an unrealistic
example! Let’s say we’re trying to explain Python lambdas (which is just the
first concept I thought of). You could give this example, of using map and a
lambda to double a set of numbers.

                  <p>Ready for release.
After nearly ten months of tinkering in the evening, the Marbles Squared ZX Spectrum Next port is going live this weekend.
It&#x27;s not that it actually took 10 months to develop, it&#x27;s just along the way I learnt and wrote the code grid handling in assembly, and then I wrote an assembly based dot command that handles HTTP requests both getting and posting data to web servers - and this is now part of the official spectrum core code (which will ship in future machines) - so that&#x27;s a nice bonus.
I&#x27;m fairly confident there&#x27;s no lurking bugs, though I am trying to squash one non blocking issue where the game can&#x27;t get the high scores from the web (though oddly the game was able to post the high score for the player in question 🤔). Still, I think it&#x27;s looking pretty snazzy:

All the same, the itch download page is primed and ready for release on Saturday. There&#x27;s two downloads available: the game and the game with fully documented source code and PDF overview article.
In lieu of the release, I&#x27;ve been looking back at the original version I wrote in the early 2000s and found a web based Palm Pilot emulator that let me actually play and capture screenshots of the original game (I even managed to recover the source code and published it on github). So I present to you - the old version:

Once the game is live for the Spectrum I&#x27;ll release the web version and if I planned the code right, we&#x27;ll all be able to contribute to the high score leader board!</p>

A refreshing lesson in the history of the internet, primarily focused on the US (with a decent hat tip to Dame Wendy Hall) but really well written.
A recommendation by Jeremy Keith tipped this from my &quot;to read&quot; list into my brain and it was one of the easier non-fiction books I&#x27;ve read, purely down to Evens&#x27; writing style.
Highly recommend if you&#x27;re working on the web or interested in modern computing history.</p>

                  <p>Sometimes I need to pull a complete copy of a previous file out of a github (this is useful when needing to do visual binary diffs to see which bytes have moves or changed).
To pull a specific file, say the last commit, the following command line does the trick:
git show HEAD^:./myfile.bin &gt; myfile.bin

The HEAD^ means &quot;one commit behind the head of the branch&quot; (the &quot;head&quot; being the last commit on the branch). Though if you&#x27;ve got merge commits where a commit has more than one parent commit this can get a little complicated (which why I tend to stick to just the previous commit).
Using HEAD^^ or HEAD^2 means &quot;two commits before the head of the branch&quot;. There&#x27;s also detailed stackoverflow post about the difference between the caret ^ and the tilde ~ with examples of how they traverse up the tree.</p>

                  <p>“Any comment?” is probably one of the worst ways to ask for feedback. It’s vague and open ended, and it doesn’t provide any indication of what we’re looking for. Getting good feedback starts earlier than we might expect: it starts with the request. 
It might seem counterintuitive to start the process of receiving feedback with a question, but that makes sense if we realize that getting feedback can be thought of as a form of design research. In the same way that we wouldn’t do any research without the right questions to get the insights that we need, the best way to ask for feedback is also to craft sharp questions.
Design critique is not a one-shot process. Sure, any good feedback workflow continues until the project is finished, but this is particularly true for design because design wor…</p>

                  <p>A great collection of tools similar to my own &quot;CLI improved&quot; post a few years back and includes some tools I use daily already (including jq, bat, fd and fzf).
There&#x27;s some nice additions but the trick is to use them for local tooling and not for shared tools or workflows as it&#x27;s less likely someone else will have a tool like sd installed.
The dog and xh look particularly interesting to me.

                  <p>For so many React devs, styled-components seems kinda magical. It isn&#x27;t at all clear how it uses traditional CSS features under-the-hood, and that lack of clarity can cause real problems when things go awry. In this post, we&#x27;ll learn exactly how styled-components works by building our own mini-version.</p>

                  <p>Zzo38 is undoubtedly the most prolific of esolangers. In addition to his long list of fully developed esolangs are his unimplemented ideas and experiments. He has been creating languages since 1994 with DZZZZ, a Funge-like language not much younger than Befunge. 


» Is there a meaning behind your pseudonym zzo38?

&quot;ZZO&quot; is like &quot;ZZT&quot;, which is a DOS-based game engine I have used in the past (and still do). (ZZT wasn&#x27;t Free software at the time, but it is now.)

The numbers 3 and 8 are from I wanted to decorate a pillow with numbers but those are the only numbers they had.

» Your list on the esolangs wiki of unusual features of languages is fascinating, e.g. how COBOL can change the locations GOTOs point to. Do you draw from these in designing your own languages? What are the most esoteric features you&#x27;ve found in non-esoteric languages? What do you consider the most non-intentionally-esoteric language?

It had been said that PostScript is both esoteric and non-esoteric at the same time. Additionally, I would think PostScript is both general-purpose and domain-specific at the same time, too.

                  <p>After baulking at the fuss over light and dark theming in both browsers and systems, I&#x27;ve fully jumped into the bandwagon and enjoy when my system theme switches to &quot;evening&quot; mode and everything goes easier on my eyes - I even blogged about my set up last year.
Firefox recently updated with a System Theme that would change when the system went from light to dark and back again, but I wasn&#x27;t personally so keen on the light theme.
The excellent Firefox Color lets me easily customise and adjust the theme, but at the cost of having to manually switch between light and dark. So I wrote an extension to do it for me!</p>

                  <p>When using postgres locally for development, sometimes, if the production dataset is too large, I&#x27;ll take a sample to work with locally.
More recently I&#x27;ve run into the problem that when I load new production data into tables with auto increment primary key columns, I&#x27;ll get a conflict, i.e. I load some production data in locally, and then when the auto increment runs it&#x27;ll hit a conflict - because my local sequences are completely out of sync with production.
The solution is to update my local sequence value. This is a two part process.
1. Capture current values from production:
SELECT last_value FROM public.
__seq;

So for something like user ids, this would be:
SELECT last_value FROM public.user_id_seq;
&gt;&gt;&gt; 304

If this doesn&#x27;t yield a result, then the sequence name is wrong, and it can be checked with the following query:
SELECT pg_get_serial_sequence(&#x27;user&#x27;, &#x27;id&#x27;);

Now armed with this value, in my example 304, the next part is to upload locally:
2. Update sequences locally:
ALTER SEQUENCE 
__seq RESTART WITH ;

It&#x27;s important that I update to the next value, not the current value:
ALTER SEQUENCE user_id_seq RESTART WITH 305;

Now when the next id for the user is loaded through an insert, the sequences are in sync.</p>

Feedback is also one of the most underestimated tools, and often by assuming that we’re already good at it, we settle, forgetting that it’s a skill that can be trained, grown, and improved. Poor feedback can create confusion in projects, bring down morale, and affect trust and team collaboration over the long term. Quality feedback can be a transformative force. 
Practicing our skills is surely a good way to improve, but the learning gets even faster when it’s paired with a good foundation that channels and focuses the practice. What are some foundational…</p>
