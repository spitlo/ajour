                  <p>Here&#x27;s something fun I saw which created an outage once.  I&#x27;ve written 
about this
before,
but in light of yesterday&#x27;s fun and games, I figured this one is worth 
another mention.


One way to do this on a Linux box with the usual GNU userspace stuff is 
to feed it to date, like this:


The problem is, there&#x27;s another command very much like it that will even 
spit out the same output, only it has a nice little side-effect: it 
also sets the clock.  That command is date -s.


Another problem is that you might not have known that -s has that 
effect, and you have been using it because it gives you the output you 
want, and you don&#x27;t realize what else it can do.


This then touched off a whole bunch of badness which I already talked 
about before.  It messed up other systems, and brought up questions of 
how to defend against it, and all of that other good stuff you&#x27;d expect 
to hear after a problem of that sort.

display everything, but instead it 
cleared everything.


show mpls lsp


clear mpls lsp


Hopefully the similarity to &#x27;date -d&#x27; vs. &#x27;date -s&#x27; is clear.

Small commands can have giant consequences.</p>

                  <p>Yesterday there was a big Facebook outage caused by BGP. I’ve been vaguely
interested in learning more about BGP for a long time, so I was reading a
couple of articles.
I got frustrated because none of the articles showed me how I could actually
look up information related to BGP on my computer, so I wrote a tweet asking for tools.
I got a bunch of useful replies as always, so this blog post shows some tools
you can use to look up BGP information. There might be an above average number
of things wrong in this post because I don’t understand BGP that well.
I can’t publish BGP routes
One of the reasons I’ve never learned much about BGP is – as far as I know, I don’t have access to publish BGP routes on the internet.
With most networking protocols, you can pretty trivially get access to

                  <p>I spent some time in Reeder app this morning, catching up with RSS and the latest articles published by my favorite blogs.
I was reading Scott O’Hara’s article about using JavaScript to detect high contrast and dark modes, which includes a small, very useful script to do exactly what the title says. The output of that script at first looked like it was a “false positive”. But some further investigation led me to learn something new about the prefers-color-scheme CSS user query.

Scott’s article includes a Codepen to demonstrate the output of the script. The script will check and detect if you currently have high contrast mode or dark mode enabled, and will output the result of the check.

This day in history: 2006, 2011, 2016, 2020 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading How the IMF loan-sharks the global south (permalink) When you take out a loan or get a credit card, the headline figure is the &quot;APR&quot; – the annual percentage rate of interest. But anyone who&#x27;s ever borrowed because they were poor and needed money has learned the hard way that APRs are pure fiction. To get the true APR (what economists politely call the &quot;effective&quot; APR) you have to factor in the fees, penalties and other gotchas that turn reasonable seeming interest rates into perennial, inescapable debt-traps. Take student debt. During the 2020 presi…</p>

                  <p>Hello! In June I announced that I was releasing 4 zines in print and promised “more zines
coming soon”. “Soon” has arrived! You can get any zine you want in print now!
I’m doing this now so that you can get zines in the mail in time for Christmas, or
any other end-of-year holiday you celebrate :)
you can preorder zines today!
First the basic facts!
you can preorder zines as of today
the preorder deadline is October 12
zines will ship around November 5
you’ll get them in time for Christmas
more logistical details in the Preorders FAQ
Here’s the link to get them:
Preorder print zines





Here are a few more notes about how the print zines work – they’re mostly the same as last time
why a preorder?
It makes it easier to decide how many zines to print! I don’t want to

FB critics say that the company&#x27;s machine learning and data-gathering slides disinformation past users&#x27; critical faculties, poisoning their minds. Meanwhile, Facebook itself tells advertisers that it can use data and machine learning to slide past users&#x27; critical faculties, convincing them to buy stuff.

                  <p>I got really bored tonight and went down some rabbit holes and turned up 
something from about a year ago.  If you follow the latest Linux type 
stuff, you probably remember this, but if not, this might seem new to 
you.  It&#x27;s just something dumb and amusing.


Go grab a Linux box with glibc on it.  Then compile and run this C code:


Then run it and watch what happens.  If you have multiple machines, try 
it on some of them and compare the results.  If the results are 
different, why do you suppose that is?


Neat, right?  It makes me want to go looking for places where people are 
calling these functions with ints that I can control to see if I can 
blow it up.

to see how the sausage is made by someone who did the work already.


...


This is awesome because it&#x27;s that many more possibilities.  I had been 
grepping source for &quot;isalnum&quot; to try to find inputs I can control, but 
now I realize that FAR more functions give a way into this.  Have fun!</p>

                  <p>On a rainy summer day, we pulled into Silva bay on Gabriola Island and found a place at a dock to wait out a spell of bad weather. The power receptacle appeared fine, but once we were ready to leave we found the male connection of our shore power cord had melted. Two out of three prongs were stuck in the receptacle. We&#x27;ve never had issues with our cord before, and for now we assume that the marina shore connection was faulty. Either way, we had to repair the power cord.
We always prefer to repair than to replace, so when we returned to a place with a marine store, we got ourselves replacements connections, both male and female, to replace the two damaged ends.
We thought we&#x27;d document the process of fixing a shower power cord. Although, this is only specific to Marinco marine fittings.

                  <p>Hello! On Wednesday I was talking to a friend about how it would be cool to
have an nginx playground website where you can just paste in an nginx config
and test it out. And then I realized it might actually be pretty easy to build,
so got excited and started coding and I built it. It’s at
https://nginx-playground.wizardzines.com.
Here’s a screenshot:

For the rest of the post I’m mostly going to talk about how I built the
project, because there were a few decisions that weren’t obvious to me.
how to use it
You need to enter both an nginx config and a curl or http command to make a
HTTP request to that nginx instance
And then you click “Run” in the top right, and it’ll output either:
the results of the command you executed (if nginx started successfully), or
the nginx error logs (if nginx …</p>

                  <p>Do you remember when having a great website was enough? Now, people are getting answers from Siri, Google search snippets, and mobile apps, not just our websites. Forward-thinking organizations have adopted an omnichannel content strategy, whose mission is to reach audiences across multiple digital channels and platforms.
But how do you set up a content management system (CMS) to reach your audience now and in the future? I learned the hard way that creating a content model—a definition of content types, attributes, and relationships that let people and systems understand content—with my more familiar design-system thinking would capsize my customer’s omnichannel content strategy. You can avoid that outcome by creating content models that are semantic and that also connect related content.…</p>

                  <p>I was digging through some notes on old outages tonight and found 
something potentially useful for other people.  It&#x27;s something I
have mentioned before,
but it seems like maybe that post didn&#x27;t have enough specifics to
make it really &quot;land&quot; when someone else does a web search.


On a Wednesday night not so long ago, someone opened a SEV (that is, a 
notification of something going wrong) and said the individual tasks for 
their service were &quot;crash looping&quot;.  These things ran in an environment 
where they were supervised by the job runner, so if they died, they&#x27;d be

                  <p>In 2008, Mark Changizi, a Sloan-Swartz Fellow in Theoretical Neuroscience at Caltech, noted that the eye can make sense of complex relationships that often mystify the brain. 


Our everyday visual perceptions rely upon unfathomably complex computations carried out by tens of billions of neurons across over half our cortex. In spite of this, it does not “feel” like work to see. Our cognitive powers are, in stark contrast, “slow and painful,” and we have great trouble with embarrassingly simple logic tasks. 

Might it be possible to harness our visual computational powers for other tasks, perhaps for tasks cognition finds difficult? 


In other words, could we trick the eye into performing computation? 

Changizi proposed the Escher Circuit, &quot;a special kind of image that amounts to &#x27;visual software&#x27; our &#x27;visual hardware&#x27; computes&quot; merely through perception.

Escher Circuits work by creating different states corresponding to how the eye resolves ambiguous images. Its core component, the wire, holds a state of 0 when we perceive it as if we are to the right of it; otherwise, it holds a state of 1.

                  <p>I have an older iPhone that used to be my daily driver.  It mostly just 
hangs around for testing random junk.  It&#x27;s still getting updates, and 
so when Apple offered it iOS 15 today, I installed it.  This gave me a 
chance to turn on their beta &quot;private relay&quot; stuff which seems to be 
a TOR-like system.


What did surprise me is the lack of &quot;stickiness&quot; for these IP addresses.  
Every five seconds or so, it seems to hop to another address in the same 
(IPv6, remember) /64.  If you&#x27;re not down with v6 conventions yet, this 
means the first four parts like &quot;xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx&quot; stay the same, but 
the last four change completely every time.


I actually don&#x27;t have any v4-only (aka LEGACY) stuff to try it on, so I 
have no idea what happens on that side of the world.  It probably looks 
about the same, albeit within a much smaller range of possible source IP 
addresses.  It probably resembles a CGNAT type situation.

It&#x27;ll be fun to see what this breaks, and who howls the loudest.</p>

                  <p>Hello! This post (like patterns in confusing explanations)
is another one in the “julia attempts to articulate her teaching strategy”
series.
I’ll start out by talking about a “backwards” approach to learning
that I think a lot of you will recognize (do projects first without fully
understanding what you’re doing, fill in missing knowledge after), and then
talk about I try to teach in a way that works better with that mode of
learning.
how I’ve learned programming: backwards
There are a lot of “basic” concepts in programming, like memory management,
networking, operating systems, assembly, etc. You could imagine that you learn
programming by first starting with the basic concepts and then learning
abstractions on top of those concepts.
But, even though I have a very traditional CS backgrou…</p>

                  <p>I&#x27;ve been struggling to get my head around voltage and amps - specifically after I bought a device that wanted 5V and 2A supply, but I was only giving it 1.6A I found the machine would fail (and reboot). The lack of amperage meant it wasn&#x27;t able to supply the entire board.
Just the image from this post was enough to make it click in my head 👍


VOLTAGE is like the pressure that pushes water through the hose. It is measured in volts (V).


CURRENT is like the diameter of the hose. The wider it is, the more water will flow through. It is measured in amps (I or A).


RESISTANCE is like sand in the hose that slows down the water flow. It is measured in ohms (R or Ω).

                  <p>Hello! I was talking to a Python programmer friend yesterday about debugging,
and I mentioned that I really like debugging using a REPL. He said he’d never
tried it and that it sounded fun, so I thought I’d write a quick post about it.
This debugging method doesn’t work in a lot of languages, but it does work in
Python and Ruby and kiiiiiind of in C (via gdb).
what’s a REPL?
REPL stands for “read eval print loop”. A REPL is a program that:
reads some input from you like print(f&quot;2 + 2 &#x3D; {2+2}&quot;) (read)
evaluates the input (eval)
print out the result (print)
and then goes back to step 1 (loop)
Here’s an example of me using the IPython REPL to run a print statement. (also
it demonstrates f-strings, my favourite Python 3 feature)

                  <p>There’s been a recent discussion on Twitter about the idea of adding a new element in HTML that represents a search interface. A search form, basically.
The idea is to create a semantic HTML element for the ARIA search role, which represents a landmark region “that contains a collection of items and objects that, as a whole, combine to create a search facility.”
Opinions have been shared in the Twitter thread about whether adding a new HTML element is necessary. Many have argued that it was unnecessary because we can use the ARIA search role and repurpose a form element to create the same semantics. I disagree. And this article is the longer version of my personal opinion on the subject.

                  <p>Hello! I was talking to a friend yesterday who was studying for a programming
interview and trying to learn some algorithms basics.
The topic of quadratic-time vs linear-time algorithms came up, I thought this
would be fun to write about here because avoiding quadratic-time algorithms
isn’t just important in interviews – it’s sometimes good to know about in real
life too! I’ll explain what a “quadratic-time algorithm is” in a minute :)
here are the 3 things we’ll talk about:
quadratic time functions are WAY WAY WAY slower than linear time functions
sometimes you can make a quadratic algorithm into a linear algorithm by using a hashmap
this is because hashmaps lookups are very fast (instant!)
I’m going to try to keep the math jargon to a minimum and focus on real code
examples and how fast/…</p>

                  <p>March 2020 brought to the world a scenario we only imagined possible in dystopian novels. Once bustling cities and towns were desolate. In contrast, the highways and byways of the internet were completely congested with people grasping for human connection, and internet friends became more important than ever.  Since then, there have been countless discussions […]

It’s a wonderful set of talks that happens every GDC in which each speaker is given five minutes to talk about anything they want. I talked about desktop pets, desktop toys, and why that entire concept is such a valuable mode of expression. I actually plan on writing a much longer, and more in-depth post about this (it might end up being a longer talk too), as soon as I have time… It’s a topic that has really grown on me because I think it offers so much...</p>

                  <p>I wrote this a couple of years ago in another context, but it looks like 
it&#x27;s still just as applicable today, so I decided to bring it out from 
behind the permission curtain.  This originally was only visible to 
coworkers who happened to look at my feed.  Now it isn&#x27;t.


Code runs on people.  Please keep it simple.


You can throw all kinds of wicked, nasty, complicated, 
Klein-bottle-wannabe tricks into code and the computer will shrug and 
slog on through it.


Nobody will ever have more state about the code than the original author 
at the time of creation.  Everything after that pales in comparison.  If 
it takes an hour to figure out what&#x27;s going on, well, that&#x27;s an hour 
that wasn&#x27;t spent doing something else more useful and interesting.


We get it, you&#x27;re clever.  But the business doesn&#x27;t need clever. It 
needs code that is only as complicated as absolutely necessary to get 
the job done.  Anything else is just wasted effort.


If a problem calls for clever, okay, then have at it.  But I bet it 
doesn&#x27;t.  Most things really don&#x27;t. Be honest with yourself, and with 
your future coworkers.  It makes for a healthier environment. 


I think this was originally written as an indirect response to some 
&quot;clever-wielding&quot; that had been witnessed on one of my tours of duty in 
some infrastructure team.  It&#x27;s not clear that it had any positive 
effect, though.  These things are hard to measure after the fact, 
particularly once the &quot;look how high I can pile up the clever&quot; culture 
has infected a team thoroughly and it starts being rewarded.</p>

They&#x27;re the &quot;remote proctoring&quot; company that boomed during the pandemic by promising that they could stop exam cheating through gross, discriminatory privacy invasions and snake-oil machine learning. In case you&#x27;ve lost the thread (it&#x27;s been a minute), Proctorio is a tool that transforms students&#x27; personal computers into surveillance tools.

News
This month, our little engine was fixed (read about it here) we&#x27;ve been sailing around the Gulf Islands, working from anchor. We also found Iggy&#x27;s successor, a used fiberglass dinghy that we&#x27;ve named Teapot. We&#x27;ve been rowing it from ship to shore, and it&#x27;s so, so nice. We stopped by Saltspring Island and got to meet the sailors on BosunBird, a couple who have traveled around the world on a Vancouver27. Their blog was an invaluable resource for us on our travels through Japan. 
We&#x27;ve released a solid version of noodle, our drawing tool. Follow the tutorial on our website, or check out this amazing quick start guide by Polyducks. We also released niju, our little kana-learning game. Niju was a trial to see if we could design, write and assemble a project entirely within the Uxn computer.
Our friends at Compudanzas have released part 3, 4 and 5 of their Introduction to Uxn Programming tutorial.

                  <p>A little while back I saw a technical demo that used the shell of MIDI controller and inserted a PS/2 keyboard (effectively) under the keys to then control a program on the ZX Spectrum Next.
This prompted me to buy a MIDI controller but I didn&#x27;t want to gut out the new hardware. So instead I found a way to map the USB MIDI to the PS/2 key presses, allowing me to use the piano keyboard on the retro hardware.</p>

post
about a big company project that dragged on for six months.  It elicited 
a bunch of responses in the usual places, but two or three of them were 
a little... off.  I figured I&#x27;d handle all of them at once right here.


I bet there was something that came up in the meeting where I said 
something like &quot;you should be able to talk to our server right now but 
give it a try and let us know if you can&#x27;t&quot;.  This meant that our RPC 
definitions were checked into source control like you&#x27;d expect, our 
service was already running in production (and NOT on someone&#x27;s dev 
machine), and it had a well-defined service name.  This means anyone who 
knew how to talk the company&#x27;s flavor of RPC could totally send it a 
request and get something back given just a little yak…</p>

The idea is boomers have salted away so much cash that banks don&#x27;t bid for their savings, so interest rates fall. But at last week&#x27;s Jackson Hole conference, a trio of economists presented a very different explanation for low interest, one that better fits the facts. In…</p>

                  <p>Collisions between the personal and the commercial in open-source have become familiar, like when an irate independent developer pulled a widely-used package entirely in 2016 bringing down hundreds of projects. But we don&#x27;t expect a commercial enterprise to suddenly discover a package they have long relied on forbids any use at all—and does so for a very good reason.

This was the realization for dapr, a “portable, serverless, event-driven runtime,” with 14k stars on GitHub, when an issue was opened last week about its dependency bouk/monkey. Monkey&#x27;s license, in its entirety, reads:


I do not give anyone permissions to use this tool for any purpose. Don’t use it.

I’m not interested in changing this license. Please don’t ask.


It raises the question: do even corporate entities read the licenses of packages they use? While Dapr was called out, Arduino, SalesForce, and hundreds of other projects also reference Monkey.

                  <p>Unstoppable page turner.
I&#x27;m not known for reading books quickly - heck, the last book I read was 45 pages (or 80 pages, or 90 pages, or something low according to Kindle) and it took me a week to read.
This book is 400+ pages and I swallowed it in a matter of days. I cannot resist Hunter&#x27;s writing style and it has me ending each chapter/section with &quot;just one more…&quot;.
Great stuff. It also brings in some of the end of book 4 - All The Rage into a larger storyline.
The writing is certainly formulaic to some degree, but that&#x27;s not particularly a bad thing and having familiarity with the characters, for me having read all the DI Adam Fawley series, means I can follow along at a much more interesting pace through the book.
I suspect this is classic &quot;beach reading&quot; if I were the type. I&#x27;ve enjoyed every one of Hunter&#x27;s books I&#x27;ve read so far and I&#x27;ll be pre-ordering the sixth installment: and easy choice.</p>

This evening, 11 years ago Julie and I arrived at hospital, around this precise time, to find that during the late stages of labour, Tia&#x27;s heartbeat had stopped.
Previous years, this evening specifically I try hard to hold the pain (and fear and anger) at arm&#x27;s length.
This year has been different. As each year has always been different. No different bad or different good. Different… peaceful.</p>

                  <p>One of the projects I did at a big company once upon a time was evolving 
organically, and we eventually realized we needed a &quot;dashboard&quot; of 
sorts.  That is, we wanted an internally-hosted page that would let 
anyone load it up and see what was going on with the service.  It was 
intended to be simple: ping our server, ask for the status, and then 
render the response into a simple list.  Later on, we knew we were going 
to want to add the ability to send a &quot;panic&quot; signal to our server from 
this page, so that anyone in the company could hit the &quot;big red button&quot; 
if things went haywire.


January 1: we put up a terrible hack: a shell script that runs a 
Python script that talks to the service to get the status and then 
dumps out raw HTML to a file in someone&#x27;s public_html path.

                  <p>Antiracist economist Kim Crayton says that “intention without strategy is chaos.” We’ve discussed how our biases, assumptions, and inattention toward marginalized and vulnerable groups lead to dangerous and unethical tech—but what, specifically, do we need to do to fix it? The intention to make our tech safer is not enough; we need a strategy.
This chapter will equip you with that plan of action. It covers how to integrate safety principles into your design work in order to create tech that’s safe, how to convince your stakeholders that this work is necessary, and how to respond to the critique that what we actually need is more diversity. (Spoiler: we do, but diversity alone is not the antidote to fixing unethical, unsafe tech.)

                  <p>Far more brutal than I expected.I&#x27;d known that Call of the Wild (and White Fang) were firm favourites of friends, and I knew they were books held in high regard - and I kind of assumed it was good for dog lovers.I had originally thought of reading this aloud to my daughter (absolutely a dog lover) but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t.This story quickly gets to Buck being beaten, and beaten and then beaten some more. I guess the story is about finding strength when pushed to your limits, but I&#x27;m no English scholar so I could have totally missed the point!Buck is certainly heroic (or perhaps stoic) in the face of insurmountable hardship, and perhaps this is representative of the times that London lived in?What amazed me was, apparently, the Kindle version of the book is 45 pages - and it took me a week to read - either my page numbers are wrong or I stumbled through this book!!!</p>

                  <p>In reading some of the news today, I got to thinking about my own 
experiences at big companies, and then started wondering how much I had 
written about a certain topic.  I went looking through the now-decade of 
posts here, and somehow, I&#x27;ve never talked about &quot;padding&quot;.  I mean, 
sure, the word itself comes up, but that&#x27;s when talking about padding 
out meeting times, jamming a C-64 into a suitcase, or sticking spaces 
or zeroes in front of some number.


For me, it goes something like this: if things are generally okay in my 
life, then I start the day with some amount of padding.  If something 
happens, that impacts the padding.  If there&#x27;s enough padding, it ends 
up being a mild inconvenience at worst.  For instance, this time last 
week when I had my

                  <p>I 
wrote
the other day about how I went out and bought a second cell 
phone just because I wanted it to take the burden of all of the crap my 
new employer was about to throw at me.  I didn&#x27;t get into the reasoning 
behind this, or some of my experiences, and figured it&#x27;s probably worth 
some explanation.


This was far enough back in time to where we all still had desk 
phones, and assigned numbers that would ring in straight from the 
outside world, if you can believe it.  Mine never got any use, but it 
was definitely there for the first couple of years.


In those times, things were relatively simple.  The most mixing of work 
and personal stuff you could do was using your work laptop for other 
stuff.  I did this, and I know now that it was stupid, but I will now 
explain how it came …</p>

                  <p>I have a secondary phone which doesn&#x27;t get a whole lot of use.  I bought 
it a couple of years ago before starting a full time employee gig with 
the pink mustache factory.  I did this because my friends who were 
already there advised me that the company did not supply phones but did 
expect you to load a crapload of apps on to do your job.


It also meant that I could put it away at the end of the day and all 
work-related stuff would stay out of sight and out of mind until the 
next morning.


So, overall, I was surprised when it started being really belligerent 
about battery statuses.  I would find it at the end of the day somewhere 
down below 30% charge despite doing nothing but carrying it around in my 
purse all day.  Then, it would stay there at some low value for a very

                  <p>Hello! Recently I’ve been thinking about why I explain things the way I do. The
usual way I write is:
Try to learn a topic
Read a bunch of explanations that I find confusing
Eventually understand the topic
Write an explanation that makes sense to me, to help others
So why do I find all these explanations so confusing? I decided to try and find
out! I came up with a list of 12 patterns that make explanations hard for me to
understand. For each pattern I’ll also explain what I like to do instead to
avoid the issue.
these patterns are very normal
This list isn’t meant to make you feel bad about your writing. I’ve probably
done all of these things! I’m certainly going to do them again! I even did at
least one of them while writing this post!
But knowing that I’m likely to accidently do these t…</p>

                  <p>A while back, I bought and installed a dash camera on my car.  I figured 
after initially seeing tons of crazy Russian insurance scams thwarted by 
it, and then a bunch of crazy videos from the rest of the world, it was 
my turn.  Then, over the weekend, it finally paid off by capturing video 
of something awful that happened to me.


My assumption is that the Phoenix-Vegas traffic makes things really 
crappy, hence the added enforcement and whatnot.  I figured, okay, I&#x27;ll 
set the cruise control exactly at the 75 mph limit and just leave it 
there until I&#x27;m well past this area.  At least it&#x27;s going to be 
well-maintained, well-lit, and all of that, right?  Safety corridor?
Surely that means they also maintain it better, since they enforce much 
more strenuously?

                  <p>A phonebook.yl program in Yorlang

The language Yorlang began like many code projects, with a group of programmers contemplating a what-if.


One evening after work, i was scrolling through the messages in a group chat that i&#x27;m in and i read a message by someone talking about how cool it will be to have a programming language in yoruba that can process the command &quot;sope &#x27;hello world&#x27; &quot;. So, i thought it was cool and i decided to create a very small language.


With that modest intention in mind, Karounwi Anoulowapo (based in Nigeria) created Yorlang, a JS-like language using keywords drawn from Yoruba. As colleagues requested more features, he kept expanding it until it became a full-fledged language. Other Yoruba-speaking programmers contributed, along with some non-speakers who were excited about a programming language created by and for West Africans.


One of the major contributors to the projects is a guy from the Igbo tribe. He documented the architecture of the code, contributed helper functions to the language, and also made small sample programs using yorlang.

                  <p>There was a SEV review meeting once upon a time, and in it, we had 
reviewed some incident where something bad happened involving something 
that ran as root.  I don&#x27;t remember the finer points of that one any 
more, but the resident VP who ran the show wondered aloud how much 
&quot;root exposure&quot; we had in our infra in general.  That got my attention.


After the meeting ended without using the whole 90 minutes, the room was 
still reserved for another 15-20 minutes or so, and a couple of people 
hung out to look at the list.  One noticed that this one service 
running everywhere had these options for &quot;pre&quot; and &quot;post&quot; commands.  
This was a service which was normally used for performance measurement 
stuff and involved running an external command.  You&#x27;d say &quot;okay, 
analyze this thing for me&quot;…</p>

                  <p>For some reason Spotify has increasingly been pushing shows and podcasts as a thing I might want to listen to. I don&#x27;t. I&#x27;m happily paying for Spotify so I don&#x27;t have to listen to ads, so instead I seem to get them in the podcast form.
I asked Spotify&#x27;s support how to turn this off, and they said:

We&#x27;re afraid that it&#x27;s not currently possible to remove these recommendations. Rest assured, we&#x27;ll let the right folks know this is something you&#x27;d like to see soon.

So yeah… I won&#x27;t be holding my breath.
This to me, falls within the right to repair (which I really don&#x27;t understand or agree with the push back) - so I fixed it myself.</p>

I did, oddly, enjoy the story of the poet challenging the energy being and thusly breaking reality on a galactic scale.Overall, well written, cosmic ideas, but not quite my kind of mind bending.</p>

                  <p>I used to publish questions that people have asked me either by email or on Twitter. That went on a hiatus for the past year-and-a-bit, as I’d stepped back from blogging for a time. To kick off something similar again, I asked Twitter folks what they’d be most interested in seeing me write about. One … Continue reading &quot;Mailbag: Plot. It’s a Problem.&quot;</p>

Every bezzle ends. Uber&#x27;s time is up. Uber was never going to be profitable. Never.
